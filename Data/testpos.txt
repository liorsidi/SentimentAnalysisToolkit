usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug but not the big lebowski nthe new offering from the creators of 1996s critical hit fargo is to say the least wildly entertaining noriginality has always been a strong trait in the coen brothers movies and the big lebowski is insanely original nit begins oddly enough when jeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges is mistaken for a millionaire jeff the big lebowski david huddleston whos wife bunny tara reid owes money all over town ntwo goons out to collect on bunnys debt break into dudes house nthey attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug nthe next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team steve buscemi john goodman respectively nhe is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug nhe does this and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper nthis is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments nthe coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly nalso several great supporting roles john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus nthe coens script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining ni doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998 nif you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one if not they give this one a try its a little different n
with the release of gattaca i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens or aliens in general nhollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films but what was usually lacking was a good story nand good characters nand good acting etc contact being the exception nand for some reason hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth nthe closest that i have seen anyway was 2001 a space odyssey which made mankind an alien race themselves being dwarfed by the technology which they created nnow comes gattaca another film about technology reigning supreme except here on our planet nthe difference between 2001 and this one is simple gattaca is more frightening nmost of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering nusing this premise writerdirector andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills nunfortunately due to a lack of advertising i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office nsince seeing the film i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca nlately however i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca nmost people dont even realize that it is a film ndespite this fact i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it nniccols film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter better produced and more realistic ngattaca begins in the 21st century nprocreating is now done in a petri dish and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it nnatural child birth is considered oldfashioned nwe are introduced to jerome morrow ethan hawke an employee of the gattaca space program none of the directors of the program has been murdered and the main suspect is one vincent freeman nthe only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman nvincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love nhowever after his birth and through several genetic tests doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99 chance of a weak heart as well as poor eye sight and a short life span nas a result both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics nanton loren dean is produced without flaws and the competition between brothers spawns nvincent has a dream to fly a soloflight around the titan the 14th moon of saturn but because of his condition gattaca and society in general forces him to do menial labor around the company nlabeled an invalid vincents dream seems impossible until he meets a blackmarket dna specialist german tony shalhoub ngerman introduces him to a valid who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident njerome morrow jude law agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools urine blood skin and hair samples etc that he will need to get past gattacas tight security nin exchange vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship nafter the murder however his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincents eyelashes left at the scene of the crime nirene cassini uma thurman is a genetically flawed valid working for gattaca and she begins to fall in love with vincentjerome ngattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time nonly two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years contact and the arrival and gattaca will rank among them nunfortunately whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effectsladen films it normally gets buried nthe second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs nthe orange glow of gattacas scenes are impressive but the sets deserve most of the credit nthe sets are very well done creating a futuristic sense but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers nas we look at the designs we realize that these buildings arent too far into the future nthis brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day nthe best thing however is the plot nthe story is more than your average scifithriller nat its heart it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present nperhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring nwould our society become a bunch of soulless zombies nmaybe human nature is a result of mankinds flaws nif we get rid of flaws do we get rid of dreams as well nniccols intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story or vice versa nthe power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters nwhile flat may sound like a poor job on niccols part it actually enhances the meaning behind the story nethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor giving his best performance of his lifetime so far nhis curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and valid peers numa thurman is well uma thurman nher character is slightly underdeveloped but the story isnt about her nhowever thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character njude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character nhe provides several nice touches and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one nloren dean gives a nice performance in his welldeveloped character ndean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie nalan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank nstill he does a good job ngore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film ngattaca is rated pg13 for brief violent images language some sexuality and nudity ndespite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film i wasnt exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty nit turned me off slightly but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have nif this had been a typical hollywood film it would have ended much differently nhowever with all the mindless science fiction films out there it is nice to have a film which doesnt talk down to its audience i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding g t c and a ninstead it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want a science fiction film with morals behind it nwhatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining nhopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca nand hopefully audiences will too np s personal note to p j gladnick how dare you call this film the worst film of the year ni cant even begin to image what film you do like nthat frightens me beyond anything n
another independent film this comedy which was brought by miramax for 5 million is good fun nfavreau and vaughn the lost world jurassic park 1997 play mike and trent two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women nthe film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve and along the way we get to meet some of their friends see their attempts at chatting up girls and just basically get a insight into their lives nand all of this is great fun nswingers doesnt rely on huge special effects or big name stars to provide entertainment nno it just has a great script and superb little known actors nthe script by favreau is great nmike is always missing is girlfriend who hasnt called him for six months and every time he meets a girl he always end up telling her about the ex nthe audience feels for this pathetic little man thanks to the great script nvaughn is the money swingers speak for the best as the womanizing trent always on the lookout for a new girl nsome of his chatup lines are awful but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his hard man nature nvaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film towards the end in a diner nthe conversations that go on between mike and trent are great but it never quite reaches tarantino standards which i suspect the film was trying to reach nthere are some excellent laugh out loud jokes in the film and some superbly funny set pieces such as favreau cringeworhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence nembarrassing to him hilarious to the audience nmike trents friends are also good although there characters seem a bit underwritten and we never really learn as much as we would like about them nalthough this is primarily mike and trents film it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends nthey just seem to wander aimlessly in the background nbut again the lines they say are usually pretty good and they do have some funny parts nits just a shame that they didnt have more meatier roles nthe acting is superb nas said above vaughn is superb as trent hes definitely the best thing in the film nfavreau is also good acting as the little man very well and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny ngraham boogie nights 1997 has a small but good role as lorraine a girl mike finally falls in love with nshe hardly features in the film at all but she still manages to make an impact on the audience nswingers then is funny but it does have some flaws nfirstly the running time is a bit too short nthe film comes to an abrupt halt and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer nit never really comes to a satisfying conclusion which is a shame as most films are too long nalso this type of film has been done too many times such as sleep with me 1994 nbut these small flaws dont really spoil what is a funny entertaining comedy n
the film magnolia can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests nthe dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower nthey all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart nthe numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially nfrom a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain nthey are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness nwhether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one n magnolia is a clever well thought out film from prodigy directorwriter paul thomas anderson of boogie nights fame nthe detailed character analyses and the powerful script make magnolia memorable nhowever what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories the film is never confusing nandersons control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful nhe also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of magnolias scenes drag on too long nany three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending nfrom the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesnt get boring nit is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot nthis is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation nevery character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees nfor example cop john c reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through halls daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly nthe fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes races and genders suffer nandersons explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing nthe only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously nthis was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get nthe performances in magnolia are perfection nthis is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting nanderson allows many of hollywoods best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best character acting nall of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film nworth noting is tom cruise who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance nhe was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillons character as phillip baker halls wife nshe seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film n magnolia uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters nanderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours nto see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity ndiversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time ni predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future n
in one scene from the people vs nlarry flynt the hustler magazine publisher appears at a selfstaged free speech rally nas graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him flynt strides confidently across the stage delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity nthe spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in patton where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag nboth scenes were stirring larger than life richly entertaining and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies noverall that sums up the people vs nlarry flynt nthe film is a wildly entertaining hoot which despite being based on fact feels like a big phony hollywood movie nthe son of a kentucky moonshiner flynt woody harrelson ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati nthere he met althea leasure courtney love a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life nto bolster interest in his clubs he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine nflynt along with the magazines ragtag management team headed by his brother jimmy played nicely by woodys reallife brother steak shake commercial veteran brett harrelson viewed playboy magazine with contempt nthey mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos striving to keep hustler focused on what guys really want explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm and extremely crude humor nthe films prime example of hustlers attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynts naughtiness ndirector milos forman conveniently ignores the magazines frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation racism and endless scatological cartoons nflynts rag labored in welldeserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis which brought the magazine international attention big money and the attention of conservatives nan obscenity bust followed the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law nlawyer alan isaacman edward norton enters the scene hired by flynts wife nnorton an exceptional actor is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynts increasingly childish and bizarre behavior nin court we meet the sputtering conservatives headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating james cromwell nas keating blathers about flynts immorality the camera slowly moves in for a closeup of his name tag inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating who was later convicted in a 2 billion sl fraud nflynts other prime foe is rev jerry falwell who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse ntragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a wouldbe assassin leaving him paralyzed from the waist down na dark period follows as flynt and leasure hole up in an l a suite strung out on pain killers nflynt eventually kicks drugs but leasure succumbs to addiction and later aids nafter watch falwell on tv describing aids as a punishment from god flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court leading to the films climactic courtroom scene n the people vs larry flynt is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt n if theyll protect a scumbag like me then theyll protect all of you declared flynt nhes right of course but the director forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons nhe also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt nharrelson is an attractive charismatic man and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero neven a cursory look at the real flynt who is making the talk show circuit and plays the judge in an early courtroom scene shows a bloated morose and bitter man nan accurate portrayal of flynt would have made a more difficult film to watch but a richer one ndespite its flaws flynt is a fast moving rousing movie with some terrific acting especially by courtney love whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod nthe story may be candycoated but its still delicious candy n
in 1987 the stock market crashed and oliver stones wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses nwall street lucked out in its timing the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had and though its killorbekilled approach to business was exaggerated that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reaganera businessman nstone constructed his film as a mythical good vs evil tale relayed in the fastpaced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange ncritics and audiences lauded wall street elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic nim proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them ni found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stones output with its thin caricatures obvious sentiments and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen nstone goes for broke in every scene the same could be said for nearly all of his works nthis approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions nhe directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane nits all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity rather than explore what these situations are really like ni have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative as they are presented in boiler room rather than laughably over the top nthese guys are salesmen after all not televised judges nmore than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street nthe only possible solution i can muster is its release date nand not just the timeliness of the greed is good subject matter the film was plumped down in the eighties a decade in which the onejoke comedy rose to an art form and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept low result movies nin my mind the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies but bad music bad hair and bad clothes nmaybe stones after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace nboiler room is an equally welltimed film with some similarities to stones piece of crap nthey both feature a consequential fatherson relationship though boiler rooms is much more subtle and touching nand they are both concerned with the power of greed yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slipperysmooth heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street nboiler room is a message movie as well though at least until the end doesnt shove it in our faces nboiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash nas i said this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasnt been seen in quite a while not only do we want to be millionaires we want to watch other people become millionaires nin our superjudgmental poweroriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything when you have money you have it all nand seth giovanni ribisi wants it all the easy way nhes a wellintentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm the kind that sells junk stock whereupon he meets others just like him nben affleck is cast as jim the company headhunter who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko nhis job is to influence trainees into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood nits ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b s that theyre told to dish out to prospective buyers nafflecks character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwins similar character in glengary glen ross and that proves detrimental to the actors performance naffleck shouts curses and belittles his rookie employees just like baldwin minus the edge nwhen alec played the scene he became the part spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own nby comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading nthe brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game nrap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are intellectual gangsters nthey arent above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes nwe drink up this world along with seth and watch him become seduced by it just like we might be nas in all cautionary tales boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness ni know this story nwe all do nbut it can work if its told with intelligence and energy and that is how writer director ben younger tells it nas a director of please excuse my french miseenscene younger has much to learn nhis style is sitcom bland nbut his writing isnt nyoungers script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch his dialogue is like a junior david mamet ndespite the moderate camera work younger fills his phonepitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script nthe brokers hucksters counter every customer objection gently bullying them into buying stock nthese moments are filmed like psychological action scenes a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isnt aware that he is one nwith the exception of afflecks brief appearances the performances are truly exceptional nribisi who has the edgy looks of a character actor is extremely potent here working his pale angular face and eerie plaintive stare for all their worth nhe conveys childlike vulnerability his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things arent going his way in some scenes and in others hes ferociously cut throat nthe jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie ribisi is confident when its just him and the phone but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father authoritatively played by ron rifkin nboiler room thankfully avoids wall streetlike histrionics in the salespitch sequences the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys nthose ploys are taught to seth by chris vin diesel a kind broker who alternates between seths friend and his mentor ndiesl shines in his minor role nthis week i saw the scifi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner nin that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80s and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70s nnicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he cant have nnia long as the firms secretary a lone black women amongst many white men is ribisis love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets but develops into something more interesting nthe two make an oddly likeable couple nlong is smart and brash and ribisi is charmingly aloof nat one point he says to her im just lookin for some chocolate love nits a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous childlike way it becomes sweetly endearing nunfortunately towards the end the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy nthere is much crying hugging and sorrowful stares nthis is okay when taken in small doses but youngers conclusion is constructed as a series of these boohoo moments one following the other na particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seths manipulations have on one of his poor victims nits not a bad idea but the execution is lacking with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message nthat message being greed is bad nyes its patently obvious but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i havent seen much of in the movies the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur nand all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners nboiler room offers neither extreme nit gives us what is in between and for that i am thankful n
my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance or a movie that weve all seen a million times two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins nthis is exactly what happened in this movie but fortunately they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way nthe movie starts with a quick and i do mean quick glance of two presidents russell kramer jack lemmon and matt douglas james garner nwilliam haney dan aykroyd and ted matthews john heard are the new president and vice president nthere is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago nhe finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead nthis movie was exceptional for many reasons none being that they found people lemmon and garner that have good chemisty together nthey worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly one being a ladies man and one being the old man ill let you fiqure which is which nalso they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well nit seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman except then he was a congressman nexperience counts for a lot n
capsule this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii life in a japanese prison camp nto end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity nthe somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyones taste n 3 4 to 4 nmore than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way nthis may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law nduring world war ii of course the one goal was winning the war nthis led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal nwhen the japanese had captured prisoners they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal nminimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output nwhile the germans not known for their kindness in those days had a 6 mortality rate among captured prisoners of war the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27 nthe best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad nthat railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do nthe best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day nand just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll nin the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany nfilmmakers have been reticent to tell the story perhaps for fear of offending the japanese nthere are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps ncertainly there was david leans the bridge on the river kwai nthere were some lowbudget british exploitation films and that was about it nthen there were tv series a town like alice and tenko nlest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa nit is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university nthe film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them nthe story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad nit turns out to be a grim joke one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves nbeating and torture are commonplace events nmen already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable nhowever unlike as in kwai the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital called by the prisoners the death house nso goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a raillaying machine nthis is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies nthe japanese believe that the individual is nothing that conformity to groups norms is all that gives a life meaning nconformity is purpose nbefore the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp nif this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story nif the british with one american by the way and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story nit is neither nit is a stirring and believable account of camp life nthe color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow nthis serves a double purpose for cunningham nit gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat nit also creates a distancing effect nthe only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music nthis is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience ni rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale n
in these days of overlong movies meet joe black the thin red line the mask of zorro it is a shame that films like waking ned devine cant be longer than a paltry 90 minutes nthis is just a cute movie even through its mildly risque subject matter nold friends jackie bannen and michael kelley try to find the lottery winner they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings nthrough process of elimination they find that it must be lovable old ned devine who they find sitting in front of his tv clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand nwhat results is thuroughly amusing as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong and that they could really benefit nafter all old ned wont miss it nrather than divulge the later twists and turns ill stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage nbannen and kelly are a perfect pair none slightly stout the other as thin as a rail nboth getting on in years they make such a cute pair of old codgers nwaking ned devine may even be seen as a full monty for the geriatric set especially since kelly gets buffo for one amusing scene nwaking ned devine is by no means perfect but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films nthe performances by everyone in the town are great particularly the two leads nthere is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary but it hardly ruins the picture nwriterdirector kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters nscripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm not the exception nperhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more nhad i held off on my years bestworst list for another day waking ned devine officially released in late november of 98 surely would have graced the short group of the years finest films nit is light but thought provoking and sweet ni cant think of anyone who shouldnt see or wouldnt enjoy this film n
today war became a reality to me after seeing a screening of saving priivate ryan nsteve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production nthe audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war nplease keep the kids home as the r rating is for reality ntom hanks is stunning as capt john miller set out in france during ww ii to rescue and return home a soldier private ryan matt damon who lost three brothers in the war nspielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes nprivate ryan is not for everyone but i felt the time was right for a movie like this to be made nthe movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our ww ii fighting men and women nwe must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice their lives so that we may live in freedom today nfor this i thank them and for steve spielberg for making a movie that i will never forget nthe academy will not forget tom hanks come april 1999 as another well deserved oscar with be in toms posession n
synopsis shrek myers is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad john lithgow nfarquaad agrees to relocate the pests on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona diaz whom farquaad desires to wed from a faroff castle ngrudgingly shrek sets out joined in his quest by an unwanted companion donkey murphy nreview one memorable aspect of disneys aladdin was that it finally gave robin williams a character the genie to best take advantage of his comic talents n shrek does the same for eddie murphy ironically though murphys ideal vessel turns out to be an ass nall the same shrek does represent murphys best comic outing in years and as donkey he steals all the best lines nfor instance after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature donkey soars into the air and scoffs now im a flying talking donkey nand despite its many contributors the script for shrek is full of such comic gems nmyers is delightful in more of a straight man role and lithgow also gets some great moments watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man n shrek takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain nthings do go somewhat astray during the films middle segment which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movies greatest strength nbut even then one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology n
historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s nfor many critics scholars and most importantly film producers it was a thing of the past something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of blackandwhite television and noncgi special effects nbut in 1995 same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre nand same as in the case of dances with wolves he was awarded for his effort with oscars nthe name of the film was braveheart and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace 1272 1305 nin his time english king edward i longshanks played by patrick mcgoohan has almost completely subdued entire british isles including scotland whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by ius primae noctis and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights nalthough english had killed his father many years ago young scottish commoner william wallace played by mel gibson doesnt care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron played by catherine maccormack nmurrons death changes that and wallace takes arms and together with small but dedicated band of followers begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country nthrough time more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallaces ragtag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce played by angus macfadyen who wouldnt like to have a simple commoner as a national leader nbraveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson so it wouldnt be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann nhowever even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism nwhile older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytalelike vision of picturesque castles splendid costumes and knights in shining armour gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard short and brutish nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle where handtohand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details never seen since verhoevens ultranaturalistic flesh blood ncompared with this naturalistic approach most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays nbraveheart also employs humour at the right places not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences but also to underline its downtoearth atmosphere so different from previous historical epics nwhat makes braveheart larger than life is his protagonist nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and as a result character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero nwallace is more than superior to his enemies both physically and mentally yet he is able to show his sensitive more vulnerable side nnaturally when the character is based on epic poems most of historical accuracy is going down the drain which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s nhowever even those who dont particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel played by sophie marceau and make her a child nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended and final scenes arent as effective as they should be nmel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan whose cold calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema nbrendan gleeson who would later become famous for his role in boormans general is also very good as wallaces trusted companion as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosystricken king john balliol ndavid oharra is very entertaining as wallaces irish ally and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his consciencestricken character of robert the bruce nwomen in this film have rather thankless roles especially marceau as onedimensional french princess ncatherine mccormack as wallaces wife was more interesting but she was eliminated from the picture early on nfrom the technical point of view the film is also very good nphotography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen non the other hand the musical score by james horner employs too much of modernday instruments for period piece set in medieval times nalthough mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism nthe main reason for that was the fact that gibson among many historical facts chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of longshank s son prince edward played by peter hanly nhe is not only presented as a villain but also as one of the less competent in villains camp and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in politically correct hollywood nto make things even more obvious good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals nhowever although the message of this film might look rightwing it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century naccording to that ideology oppressed classes workers peasants are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and as such they are more radical less willing to make compromises and more efficient on the other hand privileged classes aristocracy bourgeoisie are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges nthis marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety nin the end whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre n

the second jackalbased film to come out in 1997 the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland and is directed by a man who hailed from joblos own alma matter concordia university in montreal canada nthe story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal but does not pretend to be 100 factual nplot naval officer ramirez quinn gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal in order to put an end to the actual militants radical activities nhe is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee nramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this assignment and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism intrigue and doublepersonality syndrome which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states ncritique great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to twohour runtime nadmittedly i wasnt a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film and didnt expect much from this movie beforehand but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line nthe first hour is mostly just a buildup of things to come and does offer a great characterization of the jackal but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending nquinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal but didnt offer anything extraordinary in my opinion nsutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that theyve played in both of their respective careers of late but nonetheless appeared to relish the coldheartedness of their chosen characters ni didnt like performance put forth from quinns wife in this flick but then again she doesnt show up in most of the film so that wasnt so bad ni did however enjoy director duguays interesting style and cinematic vision nthis thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer ni thought that was neat nhaving said that i didnt think the first hour needed to be as long as it was and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the fake jackal met with the real jackals girlfriend without much retrospection on her part but all in all not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre nlittle known facts ben kingsleys real name is krishna banji he stands 5 8 was born in scarborough england and won the best actor honor in 1982s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi nmany scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal canada joblos haven of restfulness ndonald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland is canadian and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal n
the submarine genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is nthink about it nthese films are completely based in reality yet only a handful of people have ever been on one making them fascinating to the general public nthey arent like movies that take place on a plane or a train as anybody can get on one of those nand they arent like movies that happen in outer space either because no ones done any of that stuff yet nwhen a new one comes out you dont hear anyone say ugh another submarine movie like people tend to say ugh another boxing movie nlook at modern movies that involve submarines das boot the abyss the hunt for red october crimson tide nall are well regarded as topnotch entertainment ngladly joining that bunch is u571 which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u s naval submarine during world war ii nwe learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior bill paxton nmcconaugheys crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence nthe mission goes horribly wrong however and as a result mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew as well as a captured german become trapped aboard the u571 in enemy waters nthe first great thing about u571 is the films opening sequence nthe german crew of u571 are under attack which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion nits tense exciting and fascinating nand i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles nmost movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away nonce the plot gets moving u571 gives us action sequence after action sequence making the audience wonder ok now how do they get out of this nthe stakes keep raising much like in executive decision an excellent actionthriller and even though the audience knows how the film will end its a lot of fun getting there ni only have two minor complaints about the entire film nthe first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence nwhile their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going which they do i feel as though it could have been done much quicker and less conventionally ni mean did we really have to see the ships crew at a wedding nbecause of that you now know exactly whats going to happen to the groom nmy other gripe would be during the films finale ntheres an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the presidents plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one ni cannot stress this enough nuntil a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect stick with using models nyes u571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you that couldnt happen but the overall point of this film is entertainment nit succeeds fantastically npg13 n

apparently director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film american history x i dont know the details of the fight but it seems that he is not happy with the final product and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether nive heard about this kind of thing happening before and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce nas it is i found american history x to be an extremely good film not just because of tony kayes focused look at the touchy subject of racism but because of a powerful charismatic performance from edward norton nits hard to believe that it has only been two years since nortons fantastic role in primal fear but here he is now starring in his own film and making himself a star nnorton is one of those performers who becomes his character and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year nhe plays a young man named derek vinyard a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother danny edward furlong mother beverly dangelo and sister davin jennifer lien nthe film opens with a flashback in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car nwe find out that this lands him in prison and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny nin the presenttime of the film danny is in high school and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother nmuch of the film is told in flashback and we see the path that leads to dereks adoption of white supremacy nwhen derek is released having served three years in prison he finds that his brother is now a fullblown skinhead derek however has given up the violence and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things nwhat makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid thoughtless people they are intelligent and articulate and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms nits hard to make a controversial movie and not preach but kaye has found the right note for his material nbecause american history x is a mainstream film there has to be a redemption phase for our main character some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic ni partially disagree with this because although i do not advocate racism in any way its interesting the way kaye presents derek he is a loud obnoxious man but hes also very smart nthe reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men nits clear that hes passionate about his beliefs and that hes not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up nof course it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part nits astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest nin addition to getting the look just right hes perfect for this role derek requires intelligence depth and a whole lot of shouting and norton does it all with ease neven when hes at his meanest derek has a likable quality to him and thats a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead nwhat adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of dannys school avery brooks becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny nthe other performances are all terrific with standouts from furlong dangelo and lien nvisually the film is very powerful nkaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices and most of them work nicely lots of slowmotion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere nbut like a lot of movies lately american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes nalthough the climactic scene is very moving the picture ends with a pretentious preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed nfor a movie so smart a subtle up until that point it felt like a slap in the face to be handfed a theme in such a simplistic way nit makes me wonder what exactly tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film nperhaps this last scene was the problem nits hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good in a time when so many movies are timid and weak american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way n
some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen ni finished mike figgis leaving las vegas hours ago and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr nalot of people refer to this film as that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude n leaving las vegas is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are a drunk and a whore nben nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years is the drunk nhis family and friends have long since abandon him and all he has left is his liquor nin a scene early in the film we see ben staggering into a resteraunt looking for a friend of his to mooch some money off of nhe finds the guy richard lewis having dinner with a buddy and two chicks trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid nwhen ben approaches the table you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable nafter lewis gives ben the money he coldly says i think it would be best if you didnt contact me again nnow even though through the course of the film some much more depressing things happen this is when i felt the most for ben nthere was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face not to sound hokey or anything it almost brought a tear to my eye nit turns out that ben was once a semisuccessful hollywood player and apparently a pretty popular guy nnow he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women not so much for the sex but for the company for someone to talk to or spend time with nonce he is fired from his job ben decides to burn all his belongings collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death none night he runs into a prostitute a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue how far she has come since adventures in babysitting named sera nshe is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp a scumbag who getsoff by cutting her nthey are both very lonely selfdestructive people nthey immediatly hit it off both of them realizing that they need one another nand it isnt even a sexual relationship nthey dont even have sex until like the last ten minutes of the film n leaving las vegas is not a film about plot nwith the exception of what i have already revealed which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so by the way there isnt too much of a story to it nit is more a film about people and how they react to one another nfrom what i can see this is basically a perfect film nthe direction is great with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody smokey atmosphere of a film noir and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s or any other decade for that matter nbut dont go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what youre getting yourself into nfirst off if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge stay away from leaving las vegas nit is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon thats right nsecondly if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film dont see it nhowever if you are cool with those two things you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have n
by phil curtolo mel gibson braveheart gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howards ransom ngibson plays tom mullen a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath played by gary sinise forrest gump and his band of lowlife thugs kidnap his only son for 2 million ntom and his wife kate played by rene russo tin cup were instructed not to inform the police but they contacted the fbi nminutes later an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo broken arrow are in toms house and wiring every phone nthe plot sounds average just like most other kidnap movies that youve already seen and it was nothing more than that nthat is until about halfway through the movie nsuddenly tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying this is your ransom nbut this is as close as you will ever get to it ninstead i am offering this money as a reward on your head dead or alive nat this point the plot thickened and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspensefilled action film with great stunts nthe last half of the film is very well done nanother thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie nowen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones nbefore this movie sinise played mostly good guys first in of mice men then in forrest gump and most recently in apollo 13 nbut he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a copgonebad ngibson of course was just being gibson in an oscarworthy performance nalthough most of the scenes were quite predictable ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film n n
look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future nsome sort of decision had to be made and for better or worse it irrevocably altered the course of your existence nfrom timetotime everyone thinks about the roads not taken and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different nperhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action catching the 10 am train for example could have an equally profound yet less obvious impact nmaybe thats where you met your significant other and had you reached the platform just a few seconds later nfilm makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else and thats why theres no shortage of movies about this subject nthe best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance nthese themes weave their way through many of his movies including decalogue the double life of veronique and the triptych of blue white and red nhowever they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action missing or catching a train changes the course of his life nin his autobiography kieslowski on kieslowski the director describes his attraction to the concept this way the idea is rich and interesting that every day were faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which were completely unaware nwhile this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films including in a way frank capras its a wonderful life sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths nthe road not taken approach isnt just a plot device either nwriterdirector peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just missescatches a train nthe audience watches with evergrowing fascination how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life her future career where she lives whom she loves and whether she has a family nas her separate destinies diverge and then reconverge she becomes two completely different individuals nthat woman is helen played by gwyneth paltrow as a long dark haired brit none day after losing her job as an advertising executive she decides to return home in the middle of the day nthe scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform nin scenario 1 she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station non board she meets the cheerful talkative james john hannah a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty nminutes later in her flat she walks in on her lover gerry john lynch in bed with another woman jeanne tripplehorn nin scenario 2 she misses the train and shortly thereafter is the victim of an attempted mugging nshe doesnt meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerrys infidelity njuxtaposed one against the other while sharing many places cues and characters the two stories proceed in parallel from there non one level for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience nbut for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting a script with a few twists and a great deal of genuinely funny material sliding doors still fits the bill none of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures and those who could care less nit shouldnt come as any surprise that the acting at least from three of the four leads is solid npaltrow who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same yet gradually become much different is the standout nshe plays both of her roles effectively and believably the shy insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated platinumblond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man njohn hannah known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral is instantly likable njohn lynch taking a break from movies about irelands troubles does a good job presenting gerry as a inept selfish philanderer nonly jeanne tripplehorn who plays an overthetop vixen seems out of place nher attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring and its occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element none member of the supporting cast deserves special notice ndouglas mcferran who plays gerrys best friend russell is an absolute delight stealing every scene that hes in npart of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie non one occasion he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy non another occasion while laughing at gerrys plight with the women in his life he comments being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable nbut its not all in the dialogue nmcferran tears into this part with relish his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a topnotch comedy nthis is the first feature film for peter howitt and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb nthe script is shrewd and inventive combining wit romance and intelligent melodrama into a crowdpleasing whole nsliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies however nfor those who are so inclined its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe all while having a good time n

in roger michells romantic comedy notting hill william thacker hugh grant leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends its name to the films title none day american movie superstar anna scott julia roberts walks in to purchase a book on turkey nquickly enamored of each other the two embark upon an onagain offagain love affair replete with romance humor and the occasional lump in the throat nthe film opens with a nonverbal cue to annas stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actresss appearances in films and at premieres coming out of limousines walking the red carpets and such nwithout words this sequence gives us a background to her character nfollowing however is a setup narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives ni dont know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldnt have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film and which never resurfaces after the movies beginning but there it is nif there were ever a clear case for less is more this would be it nthe film is told nearly first person from williams point of view as he is in every scene nby nature of this arrangement we get a very definite sense of what he is all about and his nice guy personality wins us over easily nin fact much of notting hills strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis na scene where william is still in shock over the fact that hes even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honeysoaked apricots from his refrigerator nor take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image nwilliam assures her he wouldnt say a word then adds well ill probably tell myself now and then but id never believe it ngreat stuff nthe downside to spending so much time with william is that we dont get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible nwere constantly exposed to williams thoughts feelings actions and desires but dont actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him nthere are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that were not sure what shes been thinking all the times in between nthis combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two makes this hugh grants film hands down nhe gets the great scenes look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna the great lines and gives an overall wonderful performance njulia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actresss top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ala sandra bullock in a time to kill along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her characters unpredictable behavior nanna doesnt get a lot of our compassion nthis romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance much of it supplied by grant himself but with considerable help from the supporting cast nmost notable is rhys ifans as spike williams eccentric roommate who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh nhugh bonneville emma chambers james dreyfus and gina mckee bring up the guard as williams friends and family particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sisters birthday dinner and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst nits a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation nroger michells use of visuals doesnt sweep us off our feet but does give us more than your typical movie of this type nfor example there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass nwhereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying eight months later michell presents us with more interesting cues such as williams walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him nanother memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air nwere generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so but in this case the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a birds eye view of the ground below nmusic is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the films scenes and some of this might have been better toned down but in other areas it works to full effect nits kind of a mixed bag but still fares better than many of todays lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video nat least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate nnotting hills grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the alltime greatest film pairings but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it nfor a couple of hours you should expect to laugh more than cry and thats not so bad now is it n
capsule the world will come to an end at midnight neveryone knows it and must make a final peace with the last hours of their lives nthis is an intelligent science fiction film with no special effects just personalities and ideas n high 2 4 to 4 n it is the last night of the planet and several different people are reacting each in their own way to the end nthe film covers 6 pm to midnight nthe main character is patrick played by david mckellan who also wrote and directed n reminiscent of on the beach nbut much more so of a story richard matheson wrote the last day n p s non rereading the 1953 matheson this film is almost a loose adaptation of that story nthe similarities may be mere coincidence but they are numerous and they are very striking n us release may be problematical nthe title is lackluster and nonmemorable though very appropriate when you know about the film nalso provincial americans may not care about the end of the world coming to toronto nthey probably would feel it would not affect them nperhaps a pbs release would be possible n patricks family has declared it christmas and are hurt that the adult children will not spend the whole evening with them n grocery stores mostly looted nit seems though that one of everything is left n some people continue business as usual some want sex some react with religion some riot nsome people are in total denial n much comedy much drama n very canadian cast n it does not get dark nit is just always daytime n radio playing last night i didnt get to sleep at all nhow appropriate n david cronenberg as a kind of bland functionary manager at the gas company ngenvieve bujold as french teacher visiting former student n science fiction film with no special effects cost about two million dollars n the person you have been thrown together with by chance becomes the most important person to you for the rest of your life n why would it be so precisely at midnight nwhat about other time zones nwhat is the nature of what is destroying the world n
buffalo 66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci ngallo plays a very troubled man who was sent to jail for gambling nonce out of jail he must visit his parents who he told he was married nthe truth is he isnt married nto try to impress them he kidnaps a girl christina ricci from a tap dancing class to act as his wife nthe film is very cheaply made and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie but you dont need money to make a good film nbuffalo 66 doesnt always stay with the realistic concept and sometimes goes through outrageous events ngallos parents played by angelica huston and ben gazarra are two very strange individuals nthe mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits ngallo and ricci arrive at his parents house and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house nriccis performance during the scene at gallos parents home are very well done nthere is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes nthe way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative nthey seemed very mediocre but they worked out just fine ngallos character is developed very well nthe impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear ngallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through nhis character goes through many many problems just like many people in real life nthis character seemed very realistic to me nriccis character is funny and different nshe doesnt care much that she has been kidnaped in fact she falls in love the man who kidnaped her nricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves nbuffalo 66 isnt all laughs though nmany scenes are very dramatic and depressing ngallos character was so realistic he was extremely disturbing nsome scenes are supposed to come off as funny but they actually seemed sad and real to life nthe film sometimes drags along not giving much material ni really would have liked to see gallos parents a lot more and i would have liked to see the characters developed more noverall buffalo 66 isnt as good as some people put it up to be nthe bottom line a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom n
it is with hesitance that i call apocalypse now a masterpiece ncertainly it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease and some of the finest actors of the 1970s nthe plot an adaptation of joseph conrads heart of darkness was set in vietnam and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant coming on the heels of the end of the war n apocalypse certainly has its moments some of which are the finest in film history nthe plot is fairly simple ncaptain willard sheen is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty nhis mission is simple take a boat up to cambodian territory and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz brando with extreme prejudice nalong the way willard runs into a series of adventures including one with lt col kilgore duvall and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies nwillard s four person crew finally make it to kurtz compound where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives nwillards experiences with kurtz take up the last halfhour with a confrontation and eventual ending nthe movie is visually breathtaking nthe battle scenes are exquisitely done and the score is brilliant setting a murky mood of darkness that is firstrate nthe collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening nthe vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie nthe journey to kurtz camp is quite a ride with psychosis setting in on almost every character nthe most interesting one is kilgore the lt col who cares more about the surf than about the mission nit is at times revolting psychotic and incredible and it is one hell of a movie nthe scenes are bold inventive and powerful and the acting is stunning especially be sheen duvall and fishburne nthe narration is exquisite as is the mystery of kurtz ncoppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam kind of like saving private ryan on lsd nthe film is jarring in its implications and psychotic in its execution nthe problems come when the film slows down none of the major scenes in the film where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz is a colossal mess nthe dialogue is confusing the lighting is atrocious and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film nthe true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound nthe film slows down to a drag nsheen seems forever captured by a madman played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received nbrando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes but is bathed in shadows the entire time making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic nthe scenes are poorly done the dialogue is muffled and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief nsheen seems to adore this man but why the viewers are never told nthe entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this godlike kurtz but the scenes fall way short of expectations ngranted it has its moments which are brutally horrific but the general feeling is one of confusion nbrando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir and my feeling was that this could never be a great man this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him so why do they do it nthere are moments of brilliance but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene nthere are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending nthe finest scene at the end is sheens escape and his entrace into the temple nhis rise out of the water with the smoke coming off of his slicked head is a brilliant 30 seconds of film nyet you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done nthe psychotic ride is unforgettable at times and indeed the film on the whole is very good nit is a stunningly flawed expression of film for it addresses major issues such as mans mental stamina during bouts of war nbut one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful had the character of kurtz been more explored and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for nthere is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece but it could have been so much more rewarding n

not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets lies nlike bergman director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations nalso like bergman leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters ravished and wracked faces nand the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergmans own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film nall that is missing is a discussion of god nwhich is not to say that secrets lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master nin fact it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind nnonetheless what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place that it takes some effort to adjust to the films rhythms nonce the adjustment is made however there are great rewards none such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is nthough leigh may have adopted some of bergmans stylistic touches most obviously in an early scene of terse crosscutting during a married couples strained conversation as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any style at all nwhereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality leigh makes the camera a mere observer almost as in a pbs documentary nthe effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors nit is a tribute to everyone involved that despite such scrutiny only infrequently are we aware that anyone is acting nmuch has been made of brenda blethyns performance and rightly so but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is nthere are a few missteps nfor one except for one scene tragicomic as it happens there is scant humor in the film nthis leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout nand occasionally as with bergman the bluntness of the situations can seem forced nfor all that this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention nit is unfortunate that the audience for secrets lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film nin fact it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it nthere is even a sweet but significant irony in the films unspoken take on race relations something an american audience at least would do well to observe nnonetheless secrets lies is not for the faint of heart nthough there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen nneedless to say it is also very depressing at times nbut for many of us of course so is life nand though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better n
apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer apart from swashbuckling braveheart ndirector and former actor ron howard splash backdraft far away most noted for his dramatic film making displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 nbeing the second largest box office hit in the us this summer with more than us150 million in the states alone this film is his most successful effort yet nperhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks gump himself kevin bacon footloose tremors a few good men etc gary sinise forrest gump bill paxton aliens true lies boxing helena and ed harris the abyss just cause nall of whom gave good performances in their respective roles napollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight the worst being the challenger accident njim lovell hanks the mission commander together with his crew fred haise paxton and last minute replacement tom swigert bacon are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission more than three quarters way to the moon nsuspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home nif they ever reach it ned harris and gary sinise who play respectively the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles both delve into their roles superbly naudiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space nalso there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 nthe special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well thanks to filmmusic maestro james horner nwatch out for the launching sequence it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film na bad point though apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script nthose who consider themselves scientifically illiterate might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show nthis is however just a minor point just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film nyou should enjoy it n
 footloose has only one goal in mind to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feelgood antics nand i hate to admit it i fell for it nthe movie is about a teenager bacon who moves to a small town from the big city and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend lithgow nhe ends up falling for the preachers daughter singer and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do nas mentioned at the beginning of this review footloose is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama nthere are virtually no surprises and the writing is secondrate nso why did i enjoy it so much nfor one thing the cast is great nkevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role nwere rooting for him right from the start and unlike most films of this genre bacon doesnt play him as the rebel without a clue sort nyes he does rebel but hes also polite when he needs to be nand he never broods nthe rest of the cast is equally impressive njohn lithgow seen here playing a normal guy for a change is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian nbut lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter nby the end of the film we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character nanother nice touch is the music nwe see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with sexual innuendos but thats not true at all nthe title track performed by kenny loggins is upbeat and fun nduring the final sequence i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing nof course i soon realized that would be a little pathetic nanyway footloose is a charming little surprise ndont let the premise prevent you from watching it nit sucked me in and itll do the same to you n
written by john grisham and robert altman as al hayes ndirected by robert altman nsome time ago a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel nthe novel was a summer smash topping bestseller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads nthe only problem the novel wasnt very good nit was far more pulp than pulitzer nbut the director realized that no matter how pedestrian the prose this book really grabbed people that the author while not a great writer was a fantastic storyteller nso he took on the project convinced he could make something happen on screen nthe director nfrancis ford coppola nthe book of course was mario puzos the godfather nthe rest as they say in showbiz was history nby bringing up the godfather i dont mean to suggest that robert altmans the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness nbut the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material ncan you get any more questionable than john grisham ndepends on whom you ask nbut theres no question that grishams work grabs people nlike puzo grisham is a better storyteller than a writer unlike fellow hack michael crichton who is a good idea man but who cant tell a wellconstructed story from a can of spam nso something in grishams unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman who at 73 years old remains one of americas greatest living filmmakers nthe result is a gripping thriller that while falling short of classic cinema deserves its place in the altman canon nfrom its opening shot to the closing credits the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe nthis terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch nwitness said opening shot we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear nwe roll over the hills into the town of savannah then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone nright away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises npay attention boys and girls this shot was not conceived by john grisham but by altman nthis is what a great director can do for questionable source material nthe sports car belongs to rick magruder kenneth branagh the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases nmagruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office noutside after the party he meets one of the waitresses mallory doss embeth davidzt just as she realizes her car has been stolen ndriven by southern chivalry a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress magruder offers her a ride home nthere he learns more about mallorys life than he bargained for nher car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon robert duvall a ted kyzynskistyle whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter nmagruder perhaps influenced by mallorys decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him is sympathetic to her plight and offers to help her get her father committed right after he sleeps with her of course nthis simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end nhe succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital and for a moment all appears well nbut then dixons crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup and suddenly magruder finds himself mallory and his own children in danger nthe cops wont lift a finger to help a liberal attorney nhis only allies are his faithful assistant lois daryl hannah and his bumbling privateeye sidekick clyde robert downey jr nif this predicament wasnt bad enough hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos naltman may provide the atmosphere but branaghs performance holds the gingerbread man together nan accomplished actor when he isnt directing himself in vanity productions branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives nis his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness or of egotism nmagruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it and by then its too late nas the plot unfolds magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are nand life is never so bad that it cant get worse nif youre familiar with altmans work youll recognize several of his signature techniques ncharacters are not introduced in establishing shots but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent ncrucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action ndialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style nand of course theres my favorite altman technique the obligatory nude actress shot nthanks to altman here are some of the actresses ive had the pleasure of seeing naked sally kellerman julianne moore madeline stowe even frances mcdormand nand now i can add embeth davidtz who looks quite healthy in the altogether nthe naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film nis it oldschool sexism or a clever injoke nyou be the judge nbut back to the picture at hand nin the hands of a mere mortal the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller no better or worse than the countless others weve all endured nin the hands of a master like altman it becomes an exercise in existential doom in its own way far more successful than scorseses cape fear remake which tried for the same result nwhat may prevent it from enduring with altmans greatest work is a weak third act in fact there really is no third act in grishams story so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up nbut there are true moments of riveting suspense and great performances by branagh davidzt and downey jr more than enough to see you through nthat polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are nthey probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill nand that my friends should make you very afraid n
when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called the postman i thought an american version of il postino nstarring costner ngod help us nwhen i found out that it was not a remake of postino but an postapocalyptic epic i thought landworld nplease god make him stop nas it turns out the postman is a much better film than i had expected ndespite being set in 2013 the movie is at heart a western a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back nthe setting however allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages nthe struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it ncostners nameless character a wandering actor rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem will patton a former copymachine salesman turned bandit king nour hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman ntaking the uniform and bag of mail he passes himself off as a representative of the restored united states nhe is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets none young disciple ford lincoln mercury larenz tate organizes a fullscale postal service nford spreads the postmans message of hope until bethlehem finds that the oncemeek villagers are beginning to resist his rule nas war breaks out between bethlehems army and the postal workers costners character steps into the legend he created and goes from selfcentered loner to leader of the revolution nhis lie of the restored united states becomes a selffulfilling prophecy n postman is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wideeyed optimism sort of sergio leone meets frank capra but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling nwhat could have been another knockoff of the road warrior like waterworld was surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble ntate is the standout in the movies large cast nford lincoln mercury selfnamed is the polar opposite of odog tates character in his debut film menace ii society 1993 and tate makes fords innocent belief in hope as convincing as odogs cynicism and brutality nhis performance sells the movie ninterestingly as tate moves from his usual streetsmart roles to youthful optimism the softeyed patton who usually plays nice guys proves a disarming villain nolivia williams makes her film debut as the postmans love interest abby nwhen they first meet abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile npredictably the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero nhowever their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored she torn by grief guilt and anger he resisting his destiny n the postman is costners best work thus far nperhaps that alone gives us hope for the future n n n
in magic town jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a pollster who heads to a perfect town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only polltakers care about nhowever as time progresses and he finds himself falling in love with the town and a woman he begins to see that what hes doing is wrong nthe plot is standard stuff but thats not important nin a film like this its the calibre of the actors that make or break it nobviously since stewart stars thats practically a nonissue nhes great in the film as usual ntheres just something about him that always manages to be endearing even when hes deceiving the town folk nyoure always on his side and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition nthe film was directed by a longtime frank capra scriptwriter and it shows nthis is the type of feelgood picture that capra is famous for nby the time the end shows up on screen everything has been wrapped up very nicely nthere are no loose ends and virtually every character gets a happy ending those that deserve one anyway nin this age of cynicism its refreshing to see a movie so upbeat n magic town is a delightfully entertaining motion picture nif you believe all old movies are slowpaced youd be welladvised to check this one out n
in october of 1997 audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer nthe film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u s and even developed a cult following much like the previous years 100 million dollar grossing scream nwhen the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend it looked like a wonderful followup ndid it live up to the first film nthe answer is no njennifer love hewitt returns as julie james a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before nshe has been so upset since the incident nnightmares haunt her all over the place but she has to move on nshe know attends college and is best friends with a funny outgoing girl named karla brandy who is trying to hook julie up with will benson played by newcomer matthew settle nkarlas boyfriend is tyrell the funny outgoing type who is played by soul foods mekhi phifer nfreddie prinze jr also returns as ray julies boyfriend from a year ago none morning julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil nof course they answer it correctly and they are off to the bahamas njulie wants ray to come but he declines the offer so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie nafter they arrive at their hotel it is just them and the staff on the island nit starts off as the weekend of their dreams nsomething just had to come to mess up the one carefree weekend of julies life though nben willis muse watson is back and he isnt letting anyone survive this time nwill ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one njennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances nbrandy in particular was impressive considering this is her first feature film nyou could see that the characters were horrified and they would do anything possible to survive nmatthew settle and freddie prinze jr are a completely different story nlets start with settle nmatthew is completely fake in this film nyou could not believe a word coming out of his mouth nyou could tell he was acting and its reasons like him that this one isnt as good as the first one nhe does do a good job towards the end but that doesnt clear up the scars he already left on the film nfreddie prinze jr is almost as bad as matthew settle was nhe is almost completely unbelievable and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place nwe dont see him as much as settle otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did nmekhi phifer is alright as tyrell but yet again the dialogue is out of place nthe plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie ni like where the filmmakers went with this second installment but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one it would have been a bit better nthe cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful nthere are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel nthe sound is pretty good but still not as creepy as the first films njennifer love hewitts song how do i deal is also played for about thirty seconds ni still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film nthe first film was very suspenseful and it contained some very memorable scenes nthe last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up and almost reached the same level as the first film nbefore this part in the film there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares nthat is okay though because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes ni think the reason this film wasnt as scary as the original was because in the first one the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident nhe made them suffer for what they did nin the second film ben willis just kills anyone he feels like nhe doesnt stick with ray and julie who were the ones he is actually after nhe had to go after karla will and tyrell nif the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie ray helen and barry it could have been much better and it would have made a lot more sense nthe bottom line not a disappointment but a third in the series would be out of hand n
i was born in 1970 which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons 8 tracks and disco nhowever since i was 17 years old ive seen more than my share of adult films ni mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that im not against pornogrpahy nive seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available ndirector paul thomas andersons boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema the mid to late 70s nthis was the period when xrated movies were real movies shot on film shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics nthis was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films films that attempted to tell a real story none of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how like in an any other billion dollar industry the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete nin this case the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette nburt reynolds manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur known as jack horner nhorners has a steady family of performers some of whom live in his plush l a home nbut in the world of porn performers are a commodity the fresher the better nwhen horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque he decides to add him to his stable nit is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his nas directed by anderson the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door nboogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l a s hardcore film scene nbut the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends nthe downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut nby the films final image what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams nboogie nights is not about sex nit does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers nin fact the film isnt really about pornography at all npornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own subculture to find acceptance of who they are nthe film goes to brilliant often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world nyet like in the lauded tarantino films these people still have their own moral code their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively nthe characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion nfirst stop the den mother julianne moore in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son nsecond stop the cuckold crewman william h macy who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone the wife is played in hilarious cameos by reallife porn star nina hartley nbut the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams neddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it nwith no real ambition of his own he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame nhis alcoholic mother clearly dissatisfied with her own lot abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house nhorner introduces him to amber waves moore who immediately adopts him a nuclear family is born nthe surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her babies provides some of the films most poignant scenes nclearly she is not even fit to manage her own life let alone nurture these lost children nbut the need to love and be loved is so strong they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to neven the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family nthen again perhaps its not so different from real families at all neddie adams who later takes on the screen name dirk diggler is skillfully acted by former popstar mark wahlberg ni say former pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job nthis is bold and brave territory for such a young man nhe pulls it off marvelously nwahlberg is a big bright star with a big bright future nboogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt without the first amendment preachiness nits intimate studies of character make it the superior film nwahlbergs surprising performance is on par with woody harrelsons nbut in my opinion boogie nights is not the best film of the year ni got the feeling that itus 2 12 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance nstill if the subject matter of this film intimidates you thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway ya nknow kinda like disco n
it must be tough to be a mob boss njust ask paul vitti robert deniro a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing ni can believe it too one cant even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when hes forced to choose between an ice pick baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with nsuffering from reoccurring panic attacks paul decides he needs to consult some professional help nand who better than billy crystal nafter appearing in bottomofthebarrel flops fathers day and my giant crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here nplaying vittis private shrink the two very different stars strike an unorthodox but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish ncasting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an injoke i think nplaced in this mobsters shoes deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather part ii and casino nits obvious hes having a lot of fun doing so nthe man behind the camera is harold ramis whose credits include ghostbusters as writer and star and his best directing effort the bill murray vehicle groundhog day nramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows whats funny and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors nthe only character who weakens the payoff is crystals bridetobe lisa kudrow nplaying the same dumbeddown role as she does in friends kudrow is amusing but doesnt fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped nthe supporting cast sparkles njoe viterelli is hilarious as jelly vittis pea brained righthand man and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster whos in desperate need of the definition of closure nthe movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides nthe situation is just too cute to resist nits unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand nbut hey if youre in the mafia using obscenities probably comes naturally nand near the end seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat n
its been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters but its been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually shock cared for the characters not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles flaws and strengths to emerge so radiantly nid saw that its been at least a couple decades even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers though im hardly comparing a simple plan to say rear window or strangers on a train nyet its almost as good nits simple yet strangely complex and astonishingly rewarding because instead of moving from plot point to plot point and merely laying out theymightbecaught overtones it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral nelegantly directed by sam raimi yes the same a simple plan concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright moderately financially stable working man bill paxton his dimwitted brother billy bob thornton and his drinking buddy brent briscoe nwithout anyone around and the possibility that no one would come looking for it the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes they will keep it but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking and so they generally dont flaunt anything they dont want to flaunt theyll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse a they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities b they could try to fight off the rightful owners who are either villainous or just or c they could fight amongst themselves n a simple plan though borrows a little from each of these na little tiff with the cops here a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent a chilling gary cole there and a bit of inside feuding over here nbut as austin powers would say thats not necessarily its bag baby nwhat i most admired about this film and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that its successfully able to have its cake and eat it too nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches like the ones mentioned above but at the same time it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up and these subsequent steps go miserably awry the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity nin one early scene paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesnt look like it was all stolen not a bad idea when thornton screws up as he does continuously throughout the movie and paxton has to do some major coveringup read homicide ninstead of a quick murder and immeadiate handswashing raimi shows a lengthy painful shot from a lowangle onto paxtons face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion ntheres a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder hes committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective but the previous shot is even better more morally complex and more gutwrenching nin short probably the best piece of direction raimis ever done demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results for further proof watch persona s sex scene and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergmans ever done nbut the film hardly stops here it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof nyet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical with aid from his pregnant wife played by bridget fonda a pal to raimi he does and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights ntheres at least two grand shootouts and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history and when they arrive they dont come with masochistic delight but with cringeinducing horror nduring the one i was actually sinking into my chair with the mantra they cant do this can they nstreeming through my head nin fact this film which is getting many comparisons to the coens superior but forget about it fargo has many similar moments of manic insanity attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what in other hands would be overthetop distractedness imagine i suppose robert rodriguez directing this then nagain after seeing the evil dead films id hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed raimi moments a rifleshot notwithstanding ninstead raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch easily letting the story and characters coexist while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out like some offbeat comic touches nmost particularly billy bob thorntons character jacob is a brilliant creation nhis dimwittedness is often hilarious for most of the film every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter but theres authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that were not totally laughing at him nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of fullcondescension because thornton is so damn real njacobs a multidimensional character and while being stupid we see that as not so much a flaw but a strength to his character his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system primarily towards the middle where his bud and coconspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money nthe final third of the film spends much time with him and many of the touches upon his character not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b smith adapting his own book by the way are just great ni particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to nearsweetness and further strength of his saddened character nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance by far the best performance hes ever given and further proof that hes the best character actor in contemporary cinema if you dont believe me go back and watch his wonderful performance in primary colors a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadnt been in the same year because hes easily able to slip into a character and make him completely and utterly believable nhe brings so much weight to the film that as it is with most character actors its difficult picturing anyone else in the role nthe rest of the cast is great too from paxtons declining working man to chelcie ross amiable town sheriff neven fonda shows off her talents nicely nand if i had any complaints about the film its that the plot is almost too simplistic and that at times it seems too much like an exercise like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved nand the occasional narration is as it usually is annoying narration should be used with extreme caution especially when youre trying to set things up andor express emotions didnt raimi watch the first murder scene nand the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie the ending is basically amiss ni wont reveal it but its way too cruel and too much of an outsider setup as if the appearance of a plane wasnt already too much of that anyway nfor a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved this is the wrong ending nimagine a charactercontrolled ending otherwise its like if in crime and punishment if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing not that im at all comparing a simple plan to dostoevsky nthe ending does work despite my protestations but to me there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it then just ignore me and go about your day nbut despite my mere claims make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured not because of any kind of gore factor which is thankfully for this very minimal but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that ive frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece n
one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length nif a film is only 90 minutes but feels like 300 minutes then its crap nbut if a film last 2 12 hours and feels like 90 minutes then its excellent nboogie nights falls into the latter catagory nthe director anderson delivers a funny hip yet sometimes violent film which flies along nmark whalberg a k a nmarky mark plays eddie adams a seventeen year old with a certain gift in the midriff area njack horner reynolds is a adult film director who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business nafter running away from home eddie joins jack changes his name to dirk diggler and starts making erotic movies nin the movie business dirk meets a whole load of characters which the film introduces very quickly and slickly such as scotty phillip seymour hoffman rollergirl graham amber moore and floyd phillip baker hall and little bill william h macy all the characters are well written well played and the audience gets to know them pretty well thanks to the excellent script nwe learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce rollergirls hard time at school and little bills wife who sleeps with everyone except her husband nbut the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing nthe direction is fast thrilling and never holds up nthere are some great shots some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences and lots of other neat directional touches nthe writing is fabulous with some intelligent dialogue some funny dialogue but none of the dialogue is crap like most hollywood films such as the lost world jurassic park 1997 or tommorow never dies 1997 nboogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing on par and sometimes betters quentin tarantinos films resevoir dogs 1992 and pulp fiction 1994 nthe soundtrack is also excellent nlike american graffiti 1973 the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack which heightens the atmosphere and gives the film an extra lift nalso the costumes are great nthe clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties nthe film although excellent does have some flaws nfirstly wahlberg although excellent cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry nin both scenes where he has to act angry his acting is so off the scenes tension and anger is lost nbut the rest of the cast are excellent nburt reynolds is brilliant julianne moore shows real emotion and william h macy is great aswell but he always is nanother flaw with the film though is that the ending seems a bit tacked on nit seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit and needed to wrap up quickly nits a shame really as the rest of the film is perfectly paced nbut theyre small niggles really nboogie nights is an excellent film nsuperb directing writing acting and music all combine to make one spectacular film nwhatever you do do not miss out on boogie nights n
the rich mans wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double where the story and characters are so onedimensional and contrived that you know you shouldnt be enjoying yourself nbut somehow the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things nnot that its bad its just that its been done before and better in my opinion ni realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre but its probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet striving helplessly to get out and instead of just flushing him you end up kind of rooting for the little guy nthats basically how i felt about this movie ni mean its not very good but its not completely bad either nthe wife of the title is josie potenza played nicely by halle berry nshe is married to tony christopher mcdonald you nknow the guy who looks like joe piscapo a really stressedout businessman who drinks way to much and doesnt give josie the attention she deserves cough cough nthus she is driven into the arms of another man jake golden clive owen nnear the beginning of the film josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods nonce there however tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details im still not quite sure what line of work hes in nmaking the best of her situation josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars none night she meets a stranger named cole peter greene finally getting a meaty role nthey have dinner together and eventually both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal nafter learning that she is not happily married cole offers to take care of the problem nmanaging to escape from the psychotic maniac josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband nbut then one night cole shows up nand here is where the fun begins nfrom this point on its going to be a noholds barred clichefest ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects nthis is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out nand for the most part theyre right the rich mans wife has nary one original bone in its body nbut who cares nif youre looking for good ol dumb suspense movie you cant do much better than this nand if you suspense buffs arent already sold it has a killer of an ending too n
time bandits from director terry gilliam is a very different fantasy actionadventure movie about a group of timetraveling dwarves led by randall david rappaport who have stolen a map of the universe nthis map contains time hole that if exploited enable the men to travel back and forth through time nthe supreme being of the universe ralph richardson is the former employer of these treasureseeking bandits and he wishes desperately to regain the map nduring the travels he appears as a ghostly face demanding that they return the map that they have stolen nbut according to randall they are just borrowing it nkevin a young boy who seems quite bored with his life is unexpectedly brought into the schemes of the little men when they appear in his room which has a portal for time traveling nhe joins up with the men and becomes part of their gang following them on their robberies ntheir first victim is napoleon ian holm whom they rob during a battle that he is commanding nfrom here the group travels to the middle ages meeting up with robin hood himself neventually kevin is separated from the group and travels to an egyptian time where he is taken in by king agamemnon played by sean connery nkevin accidentally saved the kings life and the king wishes to have kevin as his son nbut the group of bandits find kevin and transport onto the deck of the titanic nmeanwhile the evil genius david warner is watching the group from fortress of ultimate darkness attempting to find a way in order to bring the men and the map to him nwhen randall learns of the fortress of ultimate darkness which supposedly contains the most fabulous object in the world the dollar signs seemingly appear on his eyes as he is convinced that they must travel there nonce inside the fortress of ultimate darkness it is unclear as to if any of the men will make it out alive ntime bandits is a fantastically made film that caters to the imagination of anyone nwith a terrific soundtrack courtesy of george harrison whom also was an executive producer time bandits is sure to be a very surrealistic timetraveling adventure with unforgettable characters that is sure to entertain anyone nterry gilliam however does not utilize that greatly his trademark ability in moviemaking during this film although this does not affect the film that greatly nand finally if you liked labyrinth youll love time bandits n
as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it the more pleased i was when i left nfirst getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz if you liked scream youll love wild things n campbell gives a stunning performance n this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days n oh yeah the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me nnow onto more serious stuff and with this film i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way nwild things has singlehandedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa nim not saying that in a bad way but when you see this film you may be shocked by what you see nhowever perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the films charming cast and tricky plot that they let the film slide with an r rating nbeing mormon im bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film ntrouble is i have already seen it nand i like it nwild things is a film noir of the 90s filled with 40s sensibilities and yet breaking the rules and modernday taboos of 90s culture nthe style in which it is filmed is rich in color nthe actors are all gorgeous people seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film nsure its all too good to be true but aint it fun to watch nwhen movies like this come along sort of a better version of basic instinct there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it nthere will be people who dont want to admit liking what they see but i tell you most anyone who sees this will like it nwild things begins at blue bay high school the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into nits almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance totally based on looks alone nof course there are those select few who may look slightly ugly but compared to the average person they are gorgeous nimmediately the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time nwe can turn off our brains right nwrong nwhile you may be expecting one thing to happen it certainly doesnt turn out that way nthe film begins in a classroom with nearly all the main characters present ntheres sam lombardo matt dillon a counselor for the students nhes heading the class discussion ntheres also kelly van ryan denise richards a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam nteaching the class however are two policemen ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubinvega who want to talk about sex n cheers crimes boos n what is a sex crime nray asks n not gettin any none student responds nthis pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch nhowever upon hearing this one student suzie toller neve campbell stands up and leaves the room commenting that they can both kiss part of her body nand so wild things sets into motion nquickly kelly begins hitting on sam but sam doesnt want anything to do with her advances nkelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him nshe even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep nsurprisingly thats really all i can tell you about the plot nany more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists nand whats more these plot twists are actually unpredictable ngoing along the way of scream wild things maintains that films surprises and then adds even more to them nthere are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen nand even though you think you may get tired of them the surprises are so genuine that its rather pleasing ngoing back over them in my mind nearly all of them work though some stretch the boundaries of belief nthankfully the convoluted plot doesnt give us much time to think about each one pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off nas for the critics who complain that the film is trashywell it is nthis is pretty much just one trashy film nhowever it is the kind of trashy that isnt hard to watch nits good trash in a sense none the screenplay knows that its not to be taken seriously and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story nthis varies everywhere from kellys mother theresa russell who is more of a caricature of rich people all the way to an ambulancechasing lawyer bill murray who wears a neckbrace to cover an insurance scam he is running nbill murray also provides the best character in the film and most of the genuine laughs nand two the sex is more than gratuitous although not unwelcomed nwild things is supposed to have sex in it what film with that title wouldnt and this movie breaks the boundaries ninstead of having heterosexual sex scenes it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell dont worry nits not as graphic as you might think nthe heterosexual scenes are quite graphic but the surprise shocker is kevin bacons fullfrontal nude scene nits very brief so if you blink you may miss ahem it nand for as long as i can remember i dont think i have seen an rrated film show an erect one before its not completely but judging from the audiences reaction it was more than they expected too nalso during one scene late in the film there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillons characters but nothing came of it makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating or if the actors refused to do it nwhat first made me want to see wild things was its cast nneve campbell of course has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released nhere however she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead nthe closest role to this was her performance in the craft though even in that she was a nice girl ncampbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent nyou can tell she will be around for a long time ndenise richards will also be around for a long time although she may be limited to the roles without much range nhere she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff yet effective performance in starship troopers nhopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability nand then there is daphne rubinvega a newcomer to the movies nshe gives a very good performance although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half ntowards the end she does get a bigger part non the male side matt dillon is probably the best giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist nkevin bacon has a slightly wooden character but he makes the most of it nyou must have admiration though for what he did on screen nand judging from many of the womens reactions in the theater to that shot they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon yeah right nand then there is bill murray nhis performance is the comic relief and he nearly steals the film nas a whole the entire cast works wondrously together and they seem at home even when doing the menage a troi ndirector john mcnaughton who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry portrait of a serial killer has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works nhis direction is smooth and stylish nthe visuals are striking filled with rich colors and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air nhowever he seems more at home when the actors arent talking nhis flyby shots of the swampy areas are brilliant and his photography of denise richards climbing out of the pool is a highlight nthe cinematography is gorgeous in its details its not often that you see a film like this and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures nthen there is the music nthis was probably the most obvious thing to me as it set the perfect mood for the film nits hard to describe in words so just see the film and listen to it nits wonderfully composed and presented nand be sure to stick around during the closing credits nmcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use while most comedies use it for outtakes nhe has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events nsome may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot but its an entertaining way to finish the film nplus there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun nwild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality nudity language and violence nagain the nudity is rather unnecessary but lets face itpeople want to see it nso why not give it to them nneve campbell admirably has a nonudity clause in her contract and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off way to go neve nthe sex scenes are graphic especially the first one we see between the mother and one of her deck hands none almost wonders how they got away with the r rating nthe language is quite harsh too ranging from sexual innuendo to your average everyday profanity nand i cant stress it enough dont allow kids under 18 to see this film nthe target age for the movie is the 1824 range and thats who should see it nits definitely not for those under 18 ndid i mention that this film is rated r however for those that do get a chance to watch it you will probably more likely be pleased and may even take friends to see it the next time n
copyright 1996 graeme huggan carry on henry is all about henry viii and his eight wives nsid james plays henry who no sooner has the film started is getting rid of his present queen and hopes to find another one soon nas part of his alliance with france he requests the handinmarriage to the queen of normandy joan sims nshe comes to england in the hope of marrying henry but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath he is totally averse to the idea of marriage nhenrys court is very corrupt with the cardinal terry scott trying to bribe cromwell kenneth williams and cromwell trying to bribe the king nthere is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen sims in the tower of london ready for execution nthe queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey who has a rather lecherous character to play this time nthe cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices nowing to circumstances sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he isnt nthis is because of renewed threats by the king of france peter gilmore to come over himself which in the end he does nby then henry has found himself a new queen played by none other than barbara windsor nit looks like he has some explaining to do nthere are standout performances by sid james as henry joan sims as marie and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal nalso there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth who plays barbaras father nthe set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good nthere is even an early appearance from david prowse who later became the green cross code man and darth vader nthe film does have its downsides though as it is getting pretty routine for the carryon team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly nthere is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw who could have helped the film along nhowever overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyones while to sit down and watch it n
countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally nluckily movie reviewers arent burdened with such legislation notherwise small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer nin case of star wars 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas the consequences would be even more severe because that film is very special for tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of fans nin any case objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best if not the best film of all times nthose who dont usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery nthe author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold objective standards in reviewing this film nlike so many previous reviewers i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since nperhaps it was childlike fascination with until then unimaginable wonders that happened long time ago in a galaxy far away nor perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before nanyway watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life nand it was also unmatched for many years to come because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas epic nstar wars wasnt just important movie for me or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment nit was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema nuntil than american motion picture industry was in a limbo social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood and new authors filled the void mostly by using hollywoods financial and technical resources to create serious personal or artsy movies nas a result audience traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate didnt want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm and huge financial success of the movie later backed by supplement industry of toys books comics role playing games and other merchandise slowly began to change the face of hollywood nserious adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion and were replaced by industrial products of blockbuster philosophy none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre nuntil 1977 science fiction movies were mostly in bproduction domain nin late 1960s bigger budgets for science fiction didnt look so strange anymore thanks to the great success of 2001 a space odyssey nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production mostly dark dystopic movies nhowever in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies even among the audience that usually doesnt like it nas a result seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away although some good dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s nafter that science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment nironically the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of new hollywood generation of young movie authors who made artsy and personal films in early 1970s ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 and nostalgic drama american graffiti nboth movies were considered personal in its time despite latter one becoming very popular nin a sense star wars is an also very personal film and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it not for it nbut unlike many personal movies of the era its personality was in line with the wishes of the general audience nthe plot set a long time ago in a galaxy far away begins in a time of civil war nthe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic nin order to quash any opposition the empire had built death star superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets nthe information about death star acquired by rebel intelligence is being transported by princess leia organa carrie fisher when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots c3po anthony daniels and r2d2 kenny baker nthose two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker mark hamill young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot nhis adventure begins when r2d2 escapes because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi alec guiness nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force nafter some hesitation luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess while the old man would teach him the ways of the force ntheir small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo harrison ford and his furry sidekick chewbacca peter mayhew ncritics who dont like the movie especially those who cant forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of new hollywood are prone to point the lack of originality non the surface they might be right lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood westerns wwii aviation movies old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawas samurai classic the hidden fortress non the other hand those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further into collective subconscious of western civilisation hinted by some mild tolkien references nthe others would find the authors element within the story star wars could be seen as an anti establishment film young longhaired easy going natureloving heroes are fighting against old uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes neven out of its historical or social context star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art ngeorge lucas direction is very good with the clever editing and a wellpaced segments between action and dramatic buildup ncharacters are welldrawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster nwe have a comingofage hero damselindistress somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time reluctant helper benevolent mentor diabolical villain and finally comic relief in form of two nonhuman characters nsome of the actors are very good alec guiness in his most famous role to date james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form nunfortunately the same cant be said for the main leads among the main trio of mark hamill carrie fisher and harrison ford only the last one had the character threedimensional enough to launch his further acting career nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology noften comparisons with 2001 space odyssey another groundbreaking sf film were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas superiority over kubrick nhowever the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive even after two decades although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly yet they arent the most remembered trademark of the movie nthat honour should definitely go to the oscar winning soundtrack by john williams whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release nyet even if they are immune to the george lucas magic they should watch this film nevertheless perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture n
shakespeare you hardly understood it in high school nwhy would you want more of it now that your english grade doesnt count on it nif this is your attitude then ill say right off the bat that kenneth branaghs hamlet is probably not for you and you might as well stop reading right now nif however you are a lover of the bard or at the very least are openminded about a challenging script read on for there is something rotten in the state of denmark nnamely the king has died and his widow the queen has wed the kings brother claudius but prince hamlet suspects foul play nhis suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brothers hands nhamlet enlisting the help of his friend horatio conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery and nthe game is afoot nthe first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes nwith external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established ninterior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers nthe hamlet castles grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings mirrorpanel doors and bridges which connect opposite sides of a secondstory loft ncostuming is equally grand drawing upon both history and imagination nnot quite the denmark of the 1600s the characters attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel nit is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars respectively nin addition to directing kenneth branagh also plays the title character nas the revengedriven royal heir branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows nfrom the anticipation of seeing his fathers ghost to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester to his eventual wrath branagh delivers in spades nevery scene truly revolves around hamlet as much a tribute to branaghs acting and directing as to shakespeares manuscript nhamlet seems to be a whos who of shakespeareantrained actors so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself njulie christie as hamlets mother gertrude and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly as do many of the supporting players nkate winslet as hamlets lover ophelia does an outstanding job demonstrating the characters plummet to the depths of dispair and madness nrichard briers as ophelias father polonius and michael moloney as her brother laertes are equally convincing nnicholas farrell as hamlets trusted friend horatio and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the twotiming rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast nhamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible nin some cases this made for interesting scenes nbilly crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick whom hamlet knew quite well ncrystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian and the result is a very funny scene nhowever charleton heston whom many might think would butcher shakespeare is the biggest surprise of all nas the player king the leader of a troupe of traveling actors he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba npart of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story with sir john gielgud and judi dench but this is most unfortunate for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time nhis offcamera speaking while gripping sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other wellvoiced actor ni wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out and let the venerable actor have the attention nunfortunately there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions njack lemmon an excellent actor just cant do shakespeare nas marcellus the guard who sees the elder hamlets ghost lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him ngerard depardieu another talented actor is wasted when given little more than the utterances of yes my lord and no my lord in the role of reynaldo nrichard attenborough has a literally walkon role showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador ni think he had two lines nthen there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway nwhen i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was nif bulging eyes are your idea of handsome well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you nhamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one nbranagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashbacktype images nthis only works about half the time and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them nyou dont have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly nthe alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar the high school english course nin it you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the kings english nor i suppose you could just read the cliff notes n
the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes and the greedy trade federation has used its armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo nwe soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboos ruler the young queen amidala natalie portman to sign a treaty giving the federation control nhowever the galactic republic has sent jedi knights quigon jinn liam neeson and obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade nno sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi and the first battle begins nit seems that for me and thousands of people like me the love for george lucass trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time nwere the fans not the freaks nwe wont go dressing up like darth vader although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool and we wont incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations not all the time anyway but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest were throwing down nall right stop looking at me like that nwe have been faithfully and patiently waiting nwaiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll nyou see the trilogy is not just a set of movies but a religion of sorts to we the faithful disciples and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah nunfortunately it is not our savior nfor weeks beforehand i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good stupendously good miraculously good nanything less and itll be the biggest disappointment of the century ni didnt want the doomsaying prophecy to come true really i didnt but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking ncharacter development is virtually nonexistent nwith the possible exception of quigon most of the films characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions nnone seem very affected by their experiences and few even show any passion at all ncontrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala njar jars life is saved by quigon early in the film and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh or supposedly so nhis speech mannerisms are so cuteified that i couldnt understand a third of what he was saying and the slapstick he performed was just distracting nhis head gets caught in an electronic field his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast he describes being in trouble as deep doo doo and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport ntherein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors nin star wars we had obiwan telling us mos eisley was a wretched hive of scum and villainy nin the phantom menace we get doo doo nthe films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story a long time ago in a galaxy far far away nthis film on the other hand constantly reminds me that its only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience nperhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition its kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500like play by play ni liked the pod race it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters nthe race would have been even more exciting without the distraction nthis aspect coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me ni suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ndidnt millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ndidnt the action figures still sell like hotcakes nof course they did and its only poor judgment that allows the mosteagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults none aspect that will appeal broadly however is the use of special effects nthe people at lucass industrial light and magic the worlds premiere effects house outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computergenerated images and reallife footage nsome of the scenes have to be seen to be believed especially the shots of a land battle between the federations robot army and jar jars countrymen nthe space battles are also impressive although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer nthis however is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today njohn williams is back of course providing a score for the film as only he can nhis music is pervasive throughout as rousing and as dramatic as ever always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately nsince this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nineepisode story star wars the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four five and six respectively the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar nas a result attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin nit would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obiwan for example but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films none of the new characters is darth maul hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this films release nin spite of the hype darth maul is a character which almost didnt have to be in the film his role is so insignificant nhe has maybe three spoken lines believe it or not a second actor voices the character and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean nwith that working against him he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment nlucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe something which has been prominent throughout nhowever he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible offering an easy out for storywriting and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a reallife connection noddly while trying to capitalize on spirituality lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little forceloving parasites in your bodys cells nthis only serves to demystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection ndont let me mislead you too far nthe phantom menace by most standards is a good film nit contains a lot of visual treats sets the stage for an epic story gives us a bit of excitement here and there and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends nits just that when held up to its predecessors and to not do so would be unrealistic this film simply pales n
lets face it the 100 millionplus smash that was goldeneye was not a good film by any means and as a bond movie was only marginally better than say a view to a kill or either of the timothy dalton pictures by virtue of nice pacing nbut it did revive the series and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ie nthe new m is a woman n tomorrow never dies is the picture goldeneye should have been its also the most entertaining bond outing since the spy who loved me nthe new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine nas an attack occurs the frontpage headline is already being prepared courtesy of carver media ncarver pryce the man is a deluded magnate a sort of hybrid of ted turner bill gates and peter sellars german scientist from dr nstrangelove physically pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days nits up to james bond to take him down with assistance of course from a wealth of gadgets including a multipurpose cell phone and beautiful women nenter michelle yeoh fresh from supercop as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda with effortless grace she cat burgles dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta and refuses the advances of our philandering hero nthey make a great team n tomorrow never dies is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film given that at the helm is none other than the director of turner hooch nspottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces each much more intricate and impressive than for instance the tank scene in goldeneye nmoreover brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play last time out the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language nreturned in brosnans eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tvs remington steele as has his deadpan wit nand though carvers motives are muddy when carver explains that genius is insanity with some success screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut pryce makes an agreeable memorable villain nin the future they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures nthere a few too many explosions in tomorrow never dies perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue nand it could have used a sharper script though i was amused by the double entendres none of which i will reveal here nas it stands the plot suffers many holes im not taking about implausibilities and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed nnow that the elements are in place modern special effects and stunt work cool pierce brosnan kickass female allies nits time to put them to use in something truly special ntheres no mistaking however that tomorrow never dies is ideal holiday escapism and for the first time in perhaps years youll walk out wanting more bond movies nreviewed december 17 1997 n
with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up loading their guns kissing each other and uttering what sounds like rock and roll n actually its lock and load you cant help thinking tarantino nand of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie clyde to natural born killers nbut if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon n inspired by true events weve heard that one before and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated nor so strangely poignant nfor this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged nbeginning with their final arrest the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris luke perry a policeman and pam ashley judd a factory worker nthey fall in love and marry but pams increasingly erratic behaviour going on spending sprees slashing herself with a knife after an argument begin to trouble the solid and stable chris nwhen chris gets sacked they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up nthen chris begins to rob banks nluke perry accomplishes the notinconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer nmoustached with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation he is perfectly cast as the longsuffering husband n its another of john mcnaughtons coups of castingagainsttype after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory nbut it is the character of pam who commands centrestage and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person nif the performance falls short of greatness however it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema whether its in betty blue tom viv or georgia nas in those movies theres the danger that the performance seems mannered a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece njudd doesnt entirely avoid this pitfall but pams craziness is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more normal chris nwhen pam reacts to her fatherinlaws death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones chris face is the picture of pained restraint nof course its the question of what is normal that is asked in normal life nmcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity nit is the rational chris that loves guns shooting is about precision control and the crazy pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog who is then called chaos chaos and you and me nwere a real family she notes wryly nit is chris methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber his wellplanned disguise as a bearded roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness nin the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background buymore the perfectly respectable consumptioncrazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases and both of them into desperate situations nits not a perfect film nsome of the dialogue is a touch too banal perhaps intentionally nthe use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pams crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film nindeed as in mcnaughtons seminal film henry portrait of a serial killer it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre that gives this determinedly unflashy moving film its great strengths nmcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet coolly realistic method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer nthe suburbs with their miles of whitefenced houses and identikit malls take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness nin its very different way this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malicks badlands nwhile pam shares the yearnings of malicks heroes to escape from ordinary life chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a normal life their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies nbut these are dreams defined by constrained by and even doomed by the limitations of the normal conventional world npams final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs where wild bushes grow symbolically the frontier the outer limits of her society but also quite literally the end of the road where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement nthe flying inkpots rating system wait for the video n a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha n pretty good bring a friend n amazing potent stuff n perfection nsee it twice n

kadosh means sacred in hebrew namos gitais fictional work after spending most of his career doing documentaries is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage even though the marriage is a loving one nthe marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israelis modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidics intolerable one as both groups are vying for control of the secular government ngitai devarimyom yom is a labor party leftist who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government it would sound the death knell of israel nthe emphasis of the film is on how the ultraorthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of gods law from only the males view nthat if they ever got control of the country their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are nthe story takes place in jerusalems jewish quarters called mea shearim where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life which is much different than the way most jews live in israel nthis is a controversial film in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones that the film is bound to anger most viewers no matter their belief nit is a slowmoving meticulous film that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go nthe force of what is seen though filmed in an objective manner never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance nthe film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they cant at present live in harmony with their own people and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace nthe film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual where every prayer is made to the virtues of god nhe even thanks god that he didnt make him a woman nhis wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom nshe looks at him with glistening eyes not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life and from seeing movies and tv nmeir is a talmudic scholar nhis father abu warda is a rabbi at the yeshiva nhe has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child nsince the hasidim look upon a womans role in life being only to conceive children and cook and clean house for the man while the mans role is to spend his time in prayer therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage nshe receives an anonymous letter that states a woman without a child is no better than dead nmeirs response is that it is written like that in the talmud nmeirs father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah nall the blame is placed on rivka who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren nshe will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself as her rigid mother koenig dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel ntheir religion doesnt permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor nrivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile but she cannot tell him that because of their religion nso when meirs father chooses a younger woman for his son she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters nrivkas spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life nshe has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov nbut because of the way they were both raised she is still a virgin nwhen yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon something his sect is not allowed to do he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer nhe now works as a singer in a nightclub nmalkas mother is worried that her daughter wont get married so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef someone whom she doesnt love nyossef is a very stern follower of the order he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a soundtruck with a bullhorn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies nthe two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage it will make her happy but while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage nthe harshest scene in the film is on malkas wedding night nyossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs and without the least bit of affection only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies as he goes inside her and rams her hard thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love nthe sisters have choices like everyone else in life does nbut the choices are obliterated by ones beliefs circumstances and inward nature and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up nfor the sisters the choices are life or death ones ngitai by closing in on the daily rituals tight living quarters and closeknit community has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life nthe film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would and everything seems strange to her all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories as she has made her choice and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed n

the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do nlives are often at stake and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable prone to turn on the negotiator at a moments notice nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor psychologist and sham artist in addition to being a police officer he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence or failing that must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower nmost of all the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible

do that nbut what if the hostageholding criminal is just as smart nwhat if hes also able to think on his feet nin fact what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor nit is

interesting premise mentioned above nafter being offered a takeitorleaveit deal by the district attorney roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum j t nwalsh taking him and others hostage and proclaiming he has been framed nalthough romans actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational buildup gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian kevin spacey which soon ensue njackson while a superb actor is miscast in the role of roman nthe actor has become so popular and so often identified as a protagonist notable exceptions can be found such as in jackie brown that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence nhow can we believe hes going to shoot a hostage no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier nunfortunately this preconception saps the film of some of its wouldbe suspenseful moments and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jacksons acting ability nalmost every time hes in a scene jackson steals it without looking back nwhen spacey appears the film has already run about a third of its course nhis is an interesting character nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation n i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower but i cant talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone he says nwhen he gets the call to action however he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be nsoon his character has to negotiate not only with roman but also with the swat commander david morse who is itching to send in a team to take roman out all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation should negotiations fail nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor nas the second protagonist spacey measures up nicely ngray really lucked out with this cast ndavid morse as commander beck ron rifkin as commander frost and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices morse played a similar role in the rock rifkin played the d a nin l a confidential and spencer played a police detective in cop land nwith the level of acting however this can be forgiven nalso in the supporting cast paul giamatti as rudy one of the hostages is notable for the comic relief he provides nhis character is initially so slimy and giamatti himself just looks so shifty that you expect to laugh before he even says anything nfortunately this doesnt distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout nj t walsh as the suspicious internal affairs inspector clocks in with one of his final performances nsadly the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam backdraft and nixon nfor one of his best performances check out sling blade in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success the actors performed together in a few good men nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing nin the end the negotiator has a plotline that parallels its reality nwere served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best nas an audience were also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie and wed like to see if one will dominate the film nboth provide some pretty good entertainment n
im an avid fan of the alien saga so this review is obviously a tad biased at least i admitted it nof course that doesnt mean that im gonna be giving this a fourstar review or something because alien resurrection the fourth film in the coolashell series is not an absolutely amazing film much like the first two were nhowever its a very good film which never fails to entertain and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series nin short i had a good time n alien resurrection leaves off 200 years after the last one where our heroine protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver the science fiction genres answer to job had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one nof course the last one wasnt very great or anything i liked it though not as much as the first two and more importantly it wasnt financially successful a tawdry 55 million bucks nso back we are with ripley back as a clone which means we get another little satirical look at cloning not that thats a bad thing but its becoming a cliche nso shes cloned aboard an even more futuristiclooking ship called the auriga by some doctors including the necessary bad government guy dr wren played by j e freeman as well as the littleseen dr gediman played by none other than brad douriff mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her nonce you get past the fact that you cant figure out where they got her blood although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one the films okay nalso on board are a band of mercenary pirates including michael wincott ron perlman kim flowers raymond cruz dominique pinon a jeunet sytable and winona ryder who plays analee call who turns out to have a bit of a secret i wont state it but unless youve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years you probably know all about it although its nicely covered up ntheres a bit of a nonsexualyetslightlyhomoerotic relationship between her and ripley but its never really deepened enough noh well nwell as you might have guessed the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship nand it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship including some shocks dan hedaya for instance whos death is comical yet sad since well hes dan hedaya and the remaining people about 7 or 8 are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth nof course the plot is all balderdash and just an excuse for some good old alien brand fun nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style not really substance although theres always a bit of it most notably in aliens with the relationship between ripley and the little girl nwhats interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach n alien is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights n aliens is a wild tense thriller n alien 3 is a bleak moody piece of seminoir n alien 4 is kind of like an offbeat french film filled with lots of humor and cool scares njeanpierre jeunet without his usual directing partner marc caro creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like das boot has with echoes hinting at a possible threat nthe chills in the film are really cool especially with the music which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes theres the most tense surgery scene since faceoff towards the beginning nand not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that nthis all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others nthere are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed none is the aforementioned surgery scene nanother one takes place between call and ripley which is just awesome nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense thrilling and jawdropping scenes in the entire saga with a small allusion to jeunets earlier film delicatessen nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool with a lovely allusion to goldfinger nbut the best scene in the entire film im sure im not the first to mention it takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her she has a an 8 tatooed on her arm nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work as it never really deapens a lot of the characters nhowever it does make us care about most of them so that when theres very little of them and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow we are pretty scared nand yeah there are some very funny lines ripley who do i have to fuck to get off this boat njohner well i can get you off nbut not this ship nthe acting is good all around with standout performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner and leland orser the poor bastad in se7en who performed the lust sin as an anxietyridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him nwinona ryder is good but not amazing like she usually is although she meshes well with the film nof course and as usual sigourney weaver steals the show nplaying a variation on the ripley character less emotional and more rude and bitter she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable nshes not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for aliens but shes just awesome noverall its a thrilling entertaining film which doesnt really amaze like the first two but is much more amazing than the third installment nthe style is the best part of the film which isnt really a bad thing but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply nbut its entertaining as hell and its definitely fit for the alien series n
ingredients man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers nsynopsis what if you woke up one day and suspected you were not on earth and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers nin dark city john murdoch rufus sewell has this problem ndark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery npoor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner na mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trenchcoats as well as by the police and the dogged inspector bumstead william hurt nis john a murderer and what can his missing memories tell him nhe searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues nbut when the clues dont fit it doesnt just confuse him it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city nto john something is fishy and very unreal about this city nhow come its always dark and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning nand how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city or how to get to nearby shell beach nevery night around midnight john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation and at this time creepy alien experimenters known as the strangers come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into peoples heads with big hypodermic needles nthe strangers have the ability to tune or warp reality using telepathic powers nturns out the city is not on earth at all nand the reason why john doesnt fall victim to the nightly suspended animation is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same godlike realitywarping abilities as the strangers neven with the help of scientist dr daniel schreber can john take back the dark city nopinion director alex proyas he also directed the crow mentions this in the dark city press kit in films science fiction is always used to have big spaceships blow up cities ni think were a little tired of that naccording to director proyas probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers nits designed so that you can watch the film over again and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch nits a philosophical piece ncinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens whether they be klingons giant bugs or proponents of the dark side of the force nbut science fiction in books reaches beyond the shootemup level and targets the big questions questions like who are we nwhat is the human condition nwhat is ethical nwhat would a true human being do nfar from comic book style on the order of spawn batman or the mutant ninja turtles dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner ndark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay na little more than 200 years ago the world was filled with unhappy peasants unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian military conformist medieval regimes nthe people took refuge in religion the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering but after death heaven would be available nmeanwhile the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven nwhen science finally overturned religion the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments nbut the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old nthis is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud kant kafka nietzsche and dostoevsky pondered what society should be and what place the individual had in it nthe existentialists in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile indifferent or alienated universe nin dark city when the last dying defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens scientific experiments on the human beings brains failed murdoch replies pointing to his head because the human condition isnt located in here n
i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory nthis was of course a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this nnot only did i get to see an advance screening i was able to see an advance screening of a very good movie nthe very fastpaced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher a fasttalking witty comical taxi driver in new york city ngibsons performance is terrific and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films ngibson again teams up with richard donner as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick and this time around the combination works even better nthe character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique ntry to imagine a toneddowned version of travis bickle who this time around is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy coverups nif you can imagine that then youve basically got jerry fletcher nin many ways i was surprised by this movie nto begin with i was surprised at how good it was ndont get me wrong its not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring but it was a very enjoyable movie nsecondly i was surprised at mel gibsons performance nhe provided a fantastic performance nthe previews of this film led me to believe it was an allout action flick which after viewing it was almost the opposite in a certain sense ngibsons character has an almost uncountable number of oneliners hilarious situations and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film nfor instance jerrys apartment and especially his security is memorable nand last i was surprised at how good the plot is nwriter brian helgeland has created a terrific story and when watching this film you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletchers farfetched or so they seem at first conspiracy theories are helgelands own opinions nmel gibson isnt the only standout in the film njulia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton the department of justice employee who cant seem to stay away from jerry fletcher who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories nhe also seems obsessed and in love with her nbut whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories she shrugs him and his beliefs off continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him njerry obviously determined to continually seek out the truth continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory which will be printed in his newsletter same title as the movie nalthough he only has five subscribers he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work and publishes his next edition nvery soon after he does so he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr jonas patrick stewart nafter barely escaping alive jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust alice sutton nthe remainder of the film is almost always fastpaced and full of action and suspense with jerrys life being constantly put into jeopardy nand more along the way the audience and alice learn more and more about jerrys life nmany things are explained throughout this film both to the characters and to the audience nfor instance the meaning of the book the catcher in the rye and its ties to assassins the reason lone gunmen have three names e g nlee harvey oswald and james earl ray and the real truth behind the grateful dead nmake sure listen closely throughout the film as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above ndefinitely when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th make sure you are standing in line to see it ni am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film especially if you are into an actionthriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations nand even if you arent you should still like this film n
after hearing reviews for woody allens upteenth movie in history celebrity range from terribly boring to just soso my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of manhattan my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time nwoody allens films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit handinhand manhattan really is one of the bestlooking films ive ever seen beautiful black and white photography of the citys best areas etc a fan cant help but feel visibly moved nthe film opens up with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky with the word help being spelled with an airplane nbeethovens 5th blasts on the soundtrack nthe city seems to stop to take notice of this moment and its all rather lovely to look at nand then we cut to a film crew shooting this as the films hilariously banal key moment in the film where the lead actress in the film melanie griffith looking as buxom and beautiful as ever has to realize somethings wrong with her life or whatever nits a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film with the great opening shots or without and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works though for the record last years deconstructing harry came awfully close nwhat the hell has happened to him nthe man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas n bullets over broadway though wonderful relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off n mighty aphrodite is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story n everyone says i love you was more of a great idea than a great film neven deconstructing harry is admittingly cheap in a way even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films nif anything the reception of celebrity by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time its not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is its him n celebrity is yes a good film but its only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film ninstead of creating the great woody allen world hes created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about nand hes fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections nits like la dolce vita without the accuracy the right amount of wit and the correct personal crisis nwoody becoming more insecure in his old age choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead nmuch has been said about his performance dead on but irritating makes one yearn for the real thing blah blah blah but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branaghs performance though featuring some of the same mannerisms stuttering whining lots o hand gestures is hardly a wartsandall impersonation nbranagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm which actually allows for his characters flaws to be more apparent nwoodys a flawed guy and we know it but we love him anyway because hes really funny and really witty and really intelligent nbranaghs allen is a bit more flatout bad but with the same charm so that yes we like him but were still not sure if hes really a good person or not nhis character lee simon is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie hits on extra actress winona ryder then goes off to interview griffith who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her and she denies him sorta nwe then learn through flashbacks that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a midlife crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion nhe has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate so that he can meet them and maybe sell his script a bank robbery movie but with a deep personal crisis nas such he has divorced his wife of several years allen regular judy davis and continues on a quest for sexual happiness boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film nafter griffith comes his escapades with a model charlize theron who is polymorphously perverse glad to see allen is using new jokes ha ha who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of la dolce vita nfollowing are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen a relationship that almost assures him success and his continued escapades with ryder whom he fancies most of all nhis story is juxtaposed with that of davis who flips out but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome friendly tv exec joe mantegna who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status nwhile lee is fumbling about selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness davis becomes happy ive become the kind of woman ive always hated and nim loving it nwithout doing a thing nthe result is a film of highs and mediums nthe mediums are what take up most of the film with sitations and scenes which dont exactly work but you cant help but pat allen on the back for trying nbut other places are really great scenes nthe opening nthe sequence with theron which is so good that i wished it hadnt ended na banana scene with bebe neuwirth droll as ever nand perhaps the best sequence a romp with hotashell teen idol brandon darrow played by none other than leo dicaprio who is so undicaprioesque that if any of this fans could sit through this film theyd never look at him the same way nhe ignites the screen with intensity and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical and totally heartbreaking for lee who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read and finds himself on a wild allday ride with him nthey go to atlantic city to watch a fight they gamble and they wind up in his hotel room where darrow gets it on with his flame gretchen mol and he lends him one of the leftover groupies nallens writing in these scenes are so good that just for them id almost recommend the film nalmost nbut what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that its a mess despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself its still a smart and insightful film nthough some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced some seem too cartoonish even for this environment allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities as it may seem to be if it were itd be extremely outoftouch but about those who want to be celebrities and how they equate celebrityhood with happiness nwe never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if theyre really happy they may appear to be on the surface but we do get close enough to lee and davis character nlee is obsessed with the phenomenon while davis takes is at arms length and never gets too involved in what it is and soon becomes one herself nbesides its witty and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allens that great woody allen feel nit may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject and yes as a part of woody allens oeuvre its merely a blip no annie hall but its no shadows and fog either but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor like the one in the beginning and make it work not once but twice n
titanic is without a doubt the best movie ive seen all year nand believe me im not an easy critic to impress the english patient was too long men in black was overhyped and several of the big summer releases were dead in the water nthank god this film got delayed until december nits my christmas present ntitanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of yearsgoneby and it is truly a stunning film nwhile watching this picture you are completely mesmerized never taking your eyes off the screen nor checking your watch to see how much longer its gonna last despite its 3 hour plus running time nas a friend of mine whos a true titanicbuff said if someone doesnt like this film its because they didnt want to ntruer words are hard to come by nof course it doesnt hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors james cameron who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time nif you wish to argue that point with me look at his list of credits the terminator aliens the abyss terminator 2 true lies etc still care to disagree nnot only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film he also wrote produced and edited it nand to show his true faith for the project he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs nits obvious he truly loves titanic nthe film opens with footage both real and fake of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the heart of the ocean which according to bill paxtons character would be worth more than the hope diamond today ntheir search turns up dissapointly no diamond but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond nthis picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose who claims to be the girl in the picture nshe is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond nalmost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past nroses narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl engaged to a rich man named cal hockley billy zane that she didnt want to marry nher mother is pushy and obnoxious and cal hockley is arrogant nthey are boarding the titanic which is sailing to america and this is where she is to marry cal nmeanwhile a young man named jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and his italian friend danny nucci win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game nthey are overjoyed and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving nfor them this is their ticket to america to a better life nfor rose she is sailing to her doom nthe first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt kate winslet and jack dawson fall in love nits the classic wrongsideofthetracks story and does sometimes resort to a few cliches nbut as i said above the love portion isnt sappy and doesnt weigh the film down as some critics have said nits sweet and it didnt make me restless at all despite the fact that i usually hate love stories nof course it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen nmost of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 including the enigmatic molly brown played by the talented kathy bates the captain of titanic bernard hill and so on nall of these characters add an extra depth to the film and make it that easier to watch nof course things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom nthe sinking is depicted realisticly and the effects are truly amazing nit is not told in a heroic fashion sense either as people are portrayed as panicking pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats and drowning and dying horrible deaths nthe best part of the movie in my opinion comes at the very end when we flash back to the future nthe crew who at first had been skeptical of roses story now are totally aborbed by her nrose goes out onto the ships ledge and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard nwe then see a dream of roses in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson nmost people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream nhowever i think it symbolized more i think it meant that rose had died and is going to a sort of heaven which would be the happiest part of her life her and her one true love jack nif anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this email me at venom8hotmail com n
clue is an unfairly ignored comedy very similar to 1976s murder by death nthis big screen version of the classic board game whats next nchutes and ladders the motion picture is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue nthe plot for what its worth has all the characters from the game in this case the names from the game are used as aliases meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr boddy lee ving the man whos been blackmailing them all nwhen he turns up dead everyone including the audience must figure out whodunnit nand in what room and with what object nwhile not as witty as neil simons murder by death clue definitely has it moments nit has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when im joking around with my friends nto this day whenever someone says the phrase well to make a long story short i have the follow up phrase too late ready to go nthe cast all very good comedic talents play well off one another while the late madeline kahn as the dark and sultry mrs white sometimes steals the film away from the rest nand colleen camp as the french maid yvette displays some of her natural talents as well nclue is available on dvd from paramount home video nit includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 85 1 and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions and features the original theatrical trailer na french language audio track is also available nthe trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not and it even includes a scene not in the film itself a scene that should have been in the film as its a good joke nalso the trailer is scored to the music from airplane which was an interesting choice nwhen clue played in theaters it ran with the gimmick of three different endings nif you wanted to see all three you had to go to the movies three separate times nso when the film was released on home video rather than releasing three separate videos all three endings were included on one tape nthe first two endings being what if nendings and the third ending being the actual ending nnow for the dvd release you get two choices nyou can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you n note theres an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this nafter watching the film with a randomly selected ending when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it nwhen you do a secret menu opens allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves nnow while i applaud the effort of paramount here as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc it just doesnt work well nfirst why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch nmaybe someone like myself whos seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only nim no technical dvd expert but i cant imagine that being too hard to accomplish nsecondly the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely dont need a distraction nfinally the back of the dvd case states and now with this special dvd version you can see all 3 surprise endings ni have no idea why they would word it that way since thats not a special feature in the slightest nthe video has been out for fifteen years now good lord has it been that long and its played on television with all three endings all the time nthese are merely minor complaints however seeing that ive watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd nthe picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy and im thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format npg n
seen july 8 1998 at the crossgates cinema 18 albany ny theater 7 at 8 15 p m with my mom using hoyts cinema cash ntheater rating 12 very good sound picture and seats nits very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic vivid sense of reality and life nall stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters lives but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do ntherefore gone with the wind deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does in such a crafted intricate and entertaining manner nits a crowning achievement not only in filmmaking but for storytelling itself nthe film takes place in georgia before during and after the civil war nthis plays a major factor in the films success nto use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy nit might also seem cliche boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers ncan a story set so long ago be relatable now nthe film confronts all these problems paradoxically by not cronfronting them nit doesnt simply plug in the right thing at the right time it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant nbuilding a strong foundation is important to all forms of media without which what is there to build on nwere given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters especially our main character scarlett ohara leigh a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel a cunning wit and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time nshe knows how her society works wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her nright from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be nbeing the most soughtafter woman allows her to manipulate men and their women to ensure she gets her way whether it be obvious i e nwho will be the one to get her food or subtle i e ngetting married just to spite someone nthe man she claims to love is ashley wilkes howard a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him nhe isnt so arrogant and demanding as scarlett in fact hes engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his nher name is melanie de havilland and she is one of the sweetest kindest and most likable characters one will ever see nshe and scarlett become very dear friends but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her and the love she has for her husband nher meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic it defines who she is but doesnt give her much emotional selfdefense nacting a catalyst to the love triangle and to the story as a whole is the daper stongwilled cunning cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler gable nhes quite a character all right everyone listens to what he has to say even though hes got a bad reputation nbutler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior nhe tells everyone the muchneeded truth in the rigid castelike society where freewill doesnt seem to exist everything is done out of honor and tradition nfor example in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners theres no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out nthis angers them not for his lack of faith but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that n do we have ammunition factories ndo we have food ndo we have a navy nall we have is tobacco nall true statements and yet the south still insists hes wrong nbutler is a shifty character to be sure but he takes such pride in his arrogance its appealing nscarlett notices this too when she first sees him and from the look butler gives her we know hes not going to stop until he has her nbut scarlett cant get past her need for ashley and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever nand so the story goes on with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life nthe conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband especially after she is marked for life when her first husband dies nthis gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story nsome are vital for only a few scenes but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film nin most films only a few characters exist for support in background but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance neven people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set nthe costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place nthe filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside real world but these types of simple approaches are never taken nthe first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war nfleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is none scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming no nnot my leg ndont cut off my leg nanother scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street but as the camera pulls back we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers but it is their moaning thats more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be nas the second half begins the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who singlehandedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north nshe manages to resurrect the family plantation but all the willpower she has cant help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the souths ultimate defeat nthis brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love hate relationship nmost of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship or lack thereof between rhett and scarlett neach uses the other for personal gain but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other nscarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett cant help but want her more every time she tries to oneup him such as marrying another man and taking over his business nthey say opposites attract but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities it borders on magnetic polarization nthey need each other and know this yet they never seem truly happy together nperhaps they mistake love for passion and the film leaves it up to us to make this call nboth have things the other wants and vice versa but when they compromise is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other nlove and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film were left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why ngable and leigh do have great chemistry always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture nall nnone neither way is possible and its a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings nits safe to say most of us wont live such overly dramatic lives as those in gone with the wind but its still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that weve just experienced a lifes worth of joy and pain n
i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of good will hunting based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film in which the main character will hunting matt damon an mit janitor in his early twenties is discovered to be an einsteinlevel closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight nthe only problem is that will is a tough street kid whos had his share of runins with the law and before long hes being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight nprofessor lambeau stellan skarsgard who had brought up the math problems in his lectures tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police will is to be released provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions nthis sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff but good will hunting rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama na conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and wills therapist sean mcguire robin williams lambeau wants to get will to use his brain while sean wants him to listen to his heart both of which he has been largely neglecting nwill finds that the former is much easier than the latter so much so in fact that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeaus attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle nhe also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar minnie driver an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her nwhat makes good will hunting work so well aside from the strong performances especially from damon and williams is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in wills life nthe scripts sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong nlambeau while he may seem a little cold at times is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when were not sure if we like what he has to say nand sean for all his warmheartedness has as lambeau and later will point out not lived up to his full intellectual potential either the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will nwills reaction to this situation and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters opinions rather than setting up an obvious right and wrong side and beating them over the head with it nfor a film with such an extraordinary character good will hunting presents itself as remarkably ordinary it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another nthis film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally farfetched situation n good will hunting also has its share of fun humor such as when will in an early therapy session pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture nand in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa nwills relationship with his friends most notably chucky ben affleck is usually rather amusing if somewhat crude the film has 100 uses of the f word which was most likely the reason for its rrating and lends itself well to the development of wills character nadd all this to the fact that good will hunting even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental and you might be wondering why i havent given this film four stars nwell for one thing no matter how well damon and affleck who wrote the screenplay and director gus van sant pull it off the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original nthere are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions nstill good will hunting takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of 97 films n
men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction action and comedy that hits the target in every possible way nalthough another alien movie men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didnt and towers above many other movies of its type nthe brilliant acting especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay is also as good as it gets ndirector barry sonnenfeld who was behind the camera for the addams family movies and get shorty has crafted a masterpiece nthe story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be nthe men in black or mib are a topsecret governmental agency that is not known to exist nthe mib are responsible for saving the world from the scum of the universe na though job indeed nthe film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens the human kind being transported across the mexico border and into the united states npresumably these aliens are all migrant workers nthat is until the mib show up and begin interrogating them nagent kay selects a particular suspicious worker and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is not an illegal human alien but a real extraterrestrial alien nwhen the alien makes a run for it agent kay is forced to eliminate the alien with one of the mibs very unique weapons and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence agent kay is forced to use another very unique device on them nthe device described as out of state eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on nfrom here we are introduced to james edwards played very well by will smith nedwards a police officer is chasing a fleeing criminal nthe criminal gives a very good chase and at one point when edwards confronts him the criminal pulls out a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground nedwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to the top of a building where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go because someone is after him nedwards doesnt take this seriously but when the criminal shows very nonhuman characteristics and leaps off the building he begins to wonder nback at the police station agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions nhe informs edwards that is was in fact a nonhuman that he was chasing and that the gun he pulled out was definitely not manmade nhe has edwards identify the gun and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day nedwards arrives and finds that he is involved in a recruiting process along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he nafter goofing up for half of the time edwards puts on a show at the firing range and agent kay notes the reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib he chased down the criminal on foot which is something that no one is supposed to be able to do nin the meantime an upstate new york farm has a very close encounter nedgar vincent donofrio owner of the farm investigates a strange crash landing and is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object which presumes to jump inside edgar and use his body as a human transport nthe bug as he is called is an intergalactic terrorist who has come to earth to attempt to kill two ambassadors nand it up to the mib with newly recruited agent jay formerly james edwards to exterminate the bug and save the planet from intergalactic war nmen in black delightfully combines fastpaced action with often hilarious comedy which is usually from will smith although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film nthe special effects are also very well done and are not the entire source of the plot as in another big alien film from the past summer nscreenwriter ed solomon writer of super mario bros nand the upcoming xmen film has surely struck gold with this story nall ages will enjoy men in black nit is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again nalthough it runs a very quick and speedy 96 minutes the entire film from beginning to end is a nonstop adventure nthe ending of the film which ties up a few loose ends for one of the main characters is also very well done na sequel is already being planned so there is more to look forward to n

sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film nsometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride ni saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes nsurprised they may have been when they realized that this picture actually had something to say nbut by the attentiveness of the crowd id say they were won over as was i i cant tell yet if truman really is that good or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year ntime alone will make that call nbut by the end of the film we were all on truman burbanks side nwe were concerned for his wellbeing and wanted him to win nthat we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey who has achieved legitimacy at last nthe truman show is a film best viewed cold with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot nunless youre under a media blackout however you probably know the basics ncarrey stars as truman burbank a capraesque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl laura linney in the south florida island town of seahaven which looks like michael eisners idea of the perfect american small town ntruman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle complete with a working wife a best bud friendly neighbors and interesting coworkers nthere is tragedy in his past his father drowned in a horrible boating accident leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water and of travel in general but overall life is good nbut then one day as truman leaves his house for work a klieg light falls magically from the sky nthis curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows that he is a prisoner on the worlds biggest soundstage that his wife friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him and that his life has for over 10 000 days been broadcast as the worlds most popular television program nwhat makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir nthe soundstage were told is only the second manmade structure visible from space ntrumans movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 000 cameras scattered throughout the town button cams dashboard cams mirror cams wife cams big cams and small cams nweir cuts the film so were never quite sure if were watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the shows omnipotent creator christof ed harris who oversees the show from a control room built into the manmade moon in seahavens sky nthe second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence nhis best friend marlon noah emmerich always has a six pack of beer with him nhis wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product nhe sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town none wonders why he didnt pick up on any of this earlier but christof has an answer for this people tend to accept the reality with which theyre presented nnevertheless truman begins to grow restless and dreams of escape to fiji where an old college sweetheart natasha mcelhone supposedly lives nthis convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way nby underplaying truman he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over nthere is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon and marlon answers with bestfriend sincerity id gladly step in front of a bus for you nbut that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof nthe abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home and from that moment were on his side nthe truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies havent we all at least once doubted our place in the world doubted the sincerity of those closest to us nultimately however the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator nwhat does god really think of us ndoes he resent our abandonment of paradise nwho exactly is watching us up there in the sky nif you enjoy the picture as much as i did credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work nas for carrey well truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play ncarrey is no jimmy stewart to his credit he doesnt try to be nhe just tries to feel the way you or i would if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us n
satirical films usually fall into one of two categories 1 longterm satire where everything including the jokes is somehow related on a large scale i e n dr nstrangelove 2 situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene i e n men in black nwhats unique about wag the dog is that it doesnt necessarily fit either of these descriptions and yet is both at the same time nthe result is a clever comedy based on an original smart premise even if the focus does tend to wander a bit nif theres anything that affects americans the most its politics and showbusiness nin this age of information and technology weve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things its gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it nwe need the media to bring us the most uptodate news but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking nthis film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas and then presents an interesting scenario if politics the media coverage of politics and the entertainment industry are so closely related couldnt someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all nthats the idea conrad brean de niro a professional washington spin doctor comes up with in order to restore the presidents good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election nbrean along with the presidents top advisor winifred ames heche fly to california to meet up with hotshot movie producer stanley motss hoffman nthey pitch him an idea to produce the image of a war with albania its a country no ones heard of so they people will buy it nsoon the wheels are in motion and the films riffing satire comes into play nwere inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation such as a folk singer visual and sound effects technicians and a modern style expert known as the fad king leary nthe initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv in the movies or in the news nthe characters dialogue is witty and funny although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcomesque nfor example one scene shows motss and breans production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee nmotss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs nsince its all computerenhanced anyway she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later nthis demonstrates the films ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise nbut then theres the gags and oneliners that although are humorous seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actresss name or whenever a problem emerges always responding with this is nothing nby the time the film makes it to the midpoint everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens nthe first act is quickly paced while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film nevery ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with and its always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it nthe screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems headon in realistic manners nhowever it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject nas the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture nwhat had started off as a brilliant somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie nstill the situation comedy is quite funny especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt nwillie schumann a war hero motss and brean concocted ntruly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time but think about afterwards and wag the dog at least succeeds in this respect nhowever in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes nthen again its a valiant effort n

with stars like sigourney weaver alien trilogy and academy award winner holly hunter the piano raising arizona etc together in a single hollywood production one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot nsadly for copycat though tightly scripted and nicely plot is still at heart a typical hollywood thriller nhelen weaver after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer darryl harry connick jr has developed a phobia for being outdoors so to speak nincidentally helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes na year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco ndetective monahan hunter and getz mulroney baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer seeks the professional help of helen who as expected was reluctant at first ncopycat borrows a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases it did work nbut copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also nmuch of the time wasted couldve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama neven so weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments nweaver being the vulnerable yet strongwithin character as in aliens and hunter being the short tough texan speaking cop as in raising arizona nharry connick jr a very good jazz singer shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter nwhich comes to the moment of judgement drum roll please ncopycat is a good thriller nalthough the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats in anticipation of the killers next immediate move nthis worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts nnice movie to bring your girlfriend to n
the year is 1962 and the military is conducting nuclear testings ninvolved in these tests is hank marshall jones an army colonel who is critical of the aboveground tests that are being done nhe urges belowground tests which no one will consider at the time until it is learned that the soviets have conducted underground tests of their own nmarshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly lange who is topless on the bases beach in full view of the entire personnel nhanks reaction is one of amusement nhes been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how nthe problem is carly is a manicdepressive and when she isnt flirting with any man who happens to be near her shes fantasizing about a fictious world where shed rather be ntypical of the mental illness she also is promiscuous and foultempered nthe mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable nfrom hanks reports which state his opposition to the armys methods of testing he is transferred from hawaii to alabama ncarly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe bleachblond and all nthe new home in alabama is pretty rundown and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum nafter meeting his new commanding officer booth hank sees an all too familiar pattern begin to repeat ncarly openly flirts with the co hank tries to deal with the situation but his only resort is to carry her off and throw her into a nearby pool narguments ensue nthe family becomes even more alienated nthe co is very interested in pursuing an encounter with carly and sends hank off to observe an underground test which causes the irradiation of two local ranchers much to the vocal objections of hank who spots them but is unable to cancel the detonation of the bomb nback at home the two girls try to hold things together but they wonder why their father cant deal with their mothers problems none daughter says hes blind and shes crazy nthe other answers theyre perfect for each other nit reaches the breaking point when the older girl locane and a boy the cos son odonnell see her mother and the co making love in an abandoned shed nshe forces her mother to tell hank and get it all out into the open nhank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical put on by the military wives including the cos wife snodgress nhe confronts the c o nbut not about carly nhe is upset over the coverup surrounding the accident during the testing na fight breaks out between the two when the co accuses hank of not being able to satisfy his wife nhank is arrested nwhat follows is manipulation and revenge on the part of the co he convinces carly to commit hank to a hospital for observation ninstead they fill him with so many drugs that he can barely cope nhe foams at the mouth and cannot even finish sewing a leather wallet as presents for his daughters ncarly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the family for the first time nthe film has an upbeat ending with hope that the family has found a way to deal with its problems nthe performances are solid throughout njones is sympathetic and loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to deal with his wifes rage nhe comforts her and offers protection nlange gives a strong and spirited portrayal of a woman on the edge who draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family namy locane is very good as she fights to keep her family together while struggling with her own doubts as to whether she even should nblue sky is based on the story of the stagner family nthe screenplay was written by rama laurie stagner with arlene sarner and jerry leichtling nthe film marks the final work of tony richardson who died shortly after its completion in 1991 nhe had made such classics as look back in anger 1958 and tom jones 1963 norion pictures underwent bankruptcy and caused the film to sit on a shelf for three years nthe film joins an alread promising fall lineup of films and is well worth catching for the performances alone n
one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made se7en is just a few steps away from brilliance nhowever those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss nthe film received mixed reviews upon release but theres an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice nat times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing but the script and the ultimate payoff are excellent nthe shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable nthis piece of work is 100 intensity nits uncomfortable to watch yet compelling n i want not to look yet i cannot turn away nthe story creeps along slowly and deliberately crafted by visionary director david fincher nhe has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions but not giving away too much too soon nthis is the guy who directed the ominous alien 3 n se7en is even more ominous because the threat is real nits human and while the script takes some artistic licence the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic nthat is if a human being could be so intelligent patient wealthy and disillusioned nafter the most bizarre opening credits ive ever seen refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment the initial character development takes place nmorgan freeman stars as detective william somerset a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society nbrad pitt costars as detective david mills the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys nthese two fine actors give the film its human qualities along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow who plays tracy mills wife nhowever none of them stands out above the material nno disrespect intended but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same nan ironic note is that somerset has only a week or 7 thats seven days left on the force to train his young protege nthe title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins as chronicled by john milton in paradise lost gluttony greed sloth lust pride envy wrath nincidentally i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found nits the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking but i wont give that away nas i said this has a great ending and no one should spoil it nanyway the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the sinners suffer for it nthe two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man nthey learn that he was murderedforced to eat himself to death nthe killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and of course somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way nif they didnt it would be one short movie nthe deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story nwe see a lot of blood but its not especially violent nthe suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shownlike most of the violence in pulp fiction n se7en is gory graphic and disturbing but all the gore is postdeath nstill if you tend to get queasy dont eat food during this film nkevin spacey plays john doe the avenging angel who claims that hes the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings nlike many crazy men he has some fine ideas but some sick ways of expressing himself nspacey doesnt appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesnt receive billing in the opening credits nhowever its his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination na great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not nthis character is so well written that its hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone nno serial killer has ever been so creative n se7en is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and its often a little too depressing nwhat it lacks in those areas it makes up for with believable dialogue topnotch screenwriting unexpected twists and realistic characters nthe technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive nfincher uses lighting music and editing quite well but his story is always the thrust of the film nfortunately we dont find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits which are run backwards up the screen nits better to imagine what paths they will follow nthis is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget nits got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thingthe evils of the world arent going to cure themselves n se7en raises some tough questions and its intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves nuseless triviacostars in 1995s se7en brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscarpitt in 12 monkeys spacey in the usual suspects for which he won n
james jones one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century has written a number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual na veteran of world war ii and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature nthey are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence a trait which lends itself to razorsharp focus nbut perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel the thin red line now a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick nthe books principal cast some thirty characters has been trimmed down for this rendition but it still retains its most endearing value neach of the roles has an everyman quality emphasizing jones examination of world war ii on the american soldier ntheres a definitive chain of command present and this also plays on the motivations of the cast nbut most importantly and perhaps intrinsic to the novel but not to the movie a dynamic and effective voiceover is used nmalick has several characters relating their thoughts giving the viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake nthe issues at stake are many and one ntold from a limited thirdperson perspective as opposed to a topdown omniscient view the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company cforcharlie to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal nthe south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war nand want to win the war they do nin an excellent performance nick nolte plays cforcharlies commanding officer lt col gordon tall nhes an aging soldier who embodies the winatallcosts mentality if only to impress his superior john travolta in a questionable cameo nthis philosophy is opposite that of captain bugger staros elias koteas who dearly values the life of each and every one of the men under his command nat the front are the privates and corporals adrien brody james caviezel ben chaplin et al lead by 1st sgt nwelsh sean penn who must actually execute the suicide orders handed down to them nthe thin red line is filled with intense visual poetry but its nearly three hours long nalthough the interest level is high throughout the first two hours the climax comes fortyfive minutes before the end of the movie it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end nthe thin red line will doubtless be compared to 1998s other masterpiece of war saving private ryan a countless number of times nbut to do so is to belittle both films for although similarities abound so do differences ndirector malick has a story to tell and for those interested in listening this can be a very outstanding movie n

in 1995 brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept the audience isnt stupid nfrom that they went on and created the most plotdriven intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years nthe result the usual suspects one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist nthe story is convoluted and is really confusing to read although easy to follow on screen nspecial investigator kujan chazz palminteri grills verbal kint kevin spacey a crippled conman who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims nkujan wants to confirm that his nemesis the rogue cop keaton gabriel byrne is actually dead nkint relates the majority of the film in flashback beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a policestation lineup in new york city nalong with dour keaton kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus stephen baldwin mordantly sarcastic hockney kevin pollak and fenster benicio del toro whose speech is virtually incomprehensible ntogether they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from new yorks finest taxi service crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins nwhat follows is a shellgame of violence and betrayal all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze nthe film is brilliantly compact its the shortest 90 minutes youll ever spend in a movie theater nthe cast is exceptional npalminteri shines he is brutally honest a true cop one who is going after the whole story because its there nbyrne is terrific his brooding character his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro who is a riot as fenster ndel toro is brilliant his lines are a jumbled mess you cant understand a word the man says but it sure is damn funny nbaldwin is also very good he is careful methodical and cold a chilling character with a nasty streak of hotblooded sarcasm npollak is also terrific as usual a very good character actor nhowever this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey nspacey is simply breathtaking he is a force on screen giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze nspaceys performance will be remembered for years for it is the best of his career it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50 years nverbal kint is a clever storyteller weak oppressed and gleefully evil to the bone yet pitiful one who draws sympathy nthe film is a good one a decent film until the last 10 minutes nwhat this film boils down to is the greatest ending in cinematic history for me at least nthe revelation of keyser soze the closing gunfights it is something wondrous nyou have to see this movie about 10 times to believe what they do nkudos to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience a delightful fastpaced furiously plotdriven movie with quirky characters phenomenal acting and some hilarious moments stuck in the middle nmcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb nwithout furnishing too many details he concocts his story and lets it run hoping the audience gets it at the end nwe do nthis might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created nkudos also to singer and john ottman who created the score nthey both create what is a true filmnoir setting carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final jarring ending nthere are flaws more questions raised than answers lack of character development and no strong female characters save one nhowever the plot and that stunning ending make up for all the flaws and more nif you havent seen the movie rent it nwatch it nthen rewind the tape and watch it again ntrust me youll be amazed n
recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantvilleone from entertainment weekly one from a newsgroup and two from different online resources neach review compared this film to the truman show nwhy nthe only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television nother than that the two movies are completely different from each other nreviewers seem to love to pick one movie i e nthe truman show obsess over it and make it a guideline for other movies nwhen pleasantville and edtv opened all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman nthe same goes for the thin red line as well nwhen it opened in decemeber probably 98 of reviews compared it to stephen spielbergs saving private ryan giving thin line no chance whatsoever ncritics loved private ryan so much that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards nthis is why i think pleasantville was underrated nif the truman show had never been made pleasantville probably would have received better reviews done better at the box office and would be remembered after its long been on the video store shelves nsure it wasnt perfect and it wasnt very believeable but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history nwith the exception of don knotts as the annoying tv repairman the film is cast perfectly the ice storms tobey maguire is david in real life he watches the old 50s sitcom pleasantville to escape from his feuding parents nhis twin sister jen reese witherspoon is a popular slut who steriotypically smokes and wears revealing clothes nbut what makes her character believeable is the dialoguethose excessive 90s terms such as like whatever and cool make her sound like the total dimwit shes supposed to be nthe twins with a little help from a tv repairman casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameoesque cast rather than a true acting one are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote ntheir new parents played by william h macy and joan allen are perfect in every way ntheir new names are bud and mary sue and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville nafter the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles the movie begins to take form nits just like watching a sitcom in itself you dont want it to end n mary sue has sex with her date the school basketball champion when he tells all his friends about it they stop preforming perfectly at basketball and things start to take color nsoon we learn that these people dont know how to express true emotions and when they learn to do so they eventually turn into color nthis eventually sparks a racial war between the coloreds and the black whites nentertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has none of the depth poignance and brilliance of the truman show nyes the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent nbut the racial settingintensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroomcertainly classifies as deep considering its what i least expected ngary ross did not try to create an intelligent award masterpiecehe just tries to convey moral messages within his work ntake for example big and dave his past films nbigbe careful what you wish for ndavegood or bad lying is still lying ndid these movies win big awards nno but they won the heart of millions npleasantville could have done that too if it wasnt for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films npleasantville a ad2am i almost lost my nose and ni like it ni like breathing through it njack nicholson chinatown n
aggressive bleak and unrelenting film about an interracial couple steve and sam damon jones and elexa williams respectively who are viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of skinheads nthe skinheads beat steve then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again nwhen sam kills herself later that evening steve decides that the skinheads must be taught a lesson nwaiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely steve shaves his head dresses in combat boots and suspenders tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols and tries to infiltrate the gang nas he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence nrandolph krets script based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the films producer shaun hill is an affront on violence and intolerance nthe film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one cant help but be disgusted by the events presented within nive seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been but david finchers film was trying to define a generation nkrets film is a wake up call to a generation and his message is a powerful one nif fincher is the kubrick of our generation then kret is our d w ngriffith thematically speaking nthere is not a single likable character in the film nthe skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury not just against other races but within their own circles nthe africanamerican characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost neven gay men get in on the act locating the skinheads lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects nthe main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge nwhat all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society nthe cast of this film is absolutely remarkable ndamon jones shows a raw energy that many actors cant seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful nhis initial reaction to hearing about his girlfriends suicide is one of the most affecting scenes i have ever seen in a film ndavid lee wilson who plays appropriately enough david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads nwilsons character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly nsadly actor dave ward who portrays the character of crew will not be able to follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of a vicious act of violence himself at the hands of a fellow actor during an incident of road rage nward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed nnote it is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism nthe message about hatred couldnt be spelled out any more clearly than it is here but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation nthere are no winners at the end of this film either nno character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began nwhere american history x had redemption for most of its characters no such victories are in store for pariahs band of twisted souls nit is this bleak ending that carries the films most powerful message the message that despite what you may be able to momentarily do to put your own mind to rest evil will still be with us and in many forms and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it entirely n
1992s alien3 marked not only the death by suicide of its popular protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver but in many ways the alien franchise itselfbox office receipts were anemic thanks to poor audience word of mouth and the critics who rallied around the first two installments 1979s alien and 1986s aliens savaged david finchers slog of a sendoff myself included nhence weaver director jeanpierre jeunet and the others behind alien resurrection faced a twofold challengenot only somehow resurrect ripley but also rescue this onceprofitable series from the scrap heap ndespite the odds they have succeeded even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two nwriter joss whedon devises a quick easy and painless answer to the dead ripley problemclone her which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 the prison planet of the third film nthat done the real challenge presents itselfwhat do with her nalien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable exploring her maternal side alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death nwhat could be next nwhedon comes up with a clever spin since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen the blood used for the clone is also infected with alien dna nso the new ripley is indeed newa humanalien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength a psychic bond with the deadly species and a more predatory attitude nunfortunately that is where alien resurrections clever streak in writing stops nthe alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features nbut the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought nthe movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding but once the creatures break free it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers including tough waif call played by a game winona ryder trying to exterminate them nand the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy nwhile the settling into triedandtrue formula is a little disconcerting the formula is triedandtrue for a reason and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon nthe alien after all these years is still terrifying and a new breed that is introduced is no less so nthe violence is appropriately grisly and extreme and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting most notably an extended underwater sequence nthe film is absolutely mesmerizing visually thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji nas technically adept as jeunets direction is perhaps his and for that matter whedons greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series na sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for but the selfawareness of the excess just adds to the fun nno alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scotts alien or the even greater film that james camerons aliens was nbut after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of finchers alien3 jeunets resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild reckless thrill ride nthat is what made the alien series so popular in the first place and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments n

the truman show paramount pictures running time 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait jim carreys dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen nin case youve been asleep for the last few months the plot centres on truman burbank carrey who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven nhis life seems so perfect however because its controlled by christoff harris creator of the truman show the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of nthats right burbanks life is being broadcast live to the american public and seahaven and all its inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage nthe film takes the jerry springer format one step too far nwith an idea so different it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator nluckily the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie ntalking of carrey hes perfect in this movie enjoying the best role in his career nhis character is a reinforced stanley ipkiss from the mask 1994 and is completely suited to carreys persona nhe occasionally falls into ace ventura mode shrieking and being silly but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey nhes not completely dramatic like the film promises however ned harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff the megalomaniac creator of the show nquiet and well spoken he burns an image into the viewer nunfortunately hes barely in the film and for the first hour dosent appear at all nalso disappointing is natascha mcelhones character sylvia nshe plays the role well but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her nthe supporting cast is excellent and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect so perfect its creepy nthe philip glass soundtrack is also superb and is used to great effect during the film npeter weir keeps the film going clearly having fun nthe film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card nalthough it is slightly slow to begin with about half an hour into film the pace really picks up and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll nsadly though the film is practically over when the film is in full steam nalso concerning the ending it is slightly too ambiguous which was disappointing nthe screenwriter andrew niccol who bought us gattaca 1997 delivers an entertaining script and manages to keep the plot in trim nwhile christoffs plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly they never go over the line which would have been easy for niccol to do nalso theres some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show noverall the truman show is excellent entertainment ncertainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces it should be viewed by everyone nit offers something to every member of the audience and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed noverall rating nreview by david wilcock 1998 n you know for kids norville barnes n
ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan nyou remember he was the title character in that 70s sitcom welcome back kotter nalways trying to help out the sweathogs frequently trying to dodge mr woodman ever wary of his wifes tuna casserole n so you ask where is he now nmr kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional highstakes poker nthats right nim not sure if its his main source of income but from what ive heard the guy occasionally comes away with 20 000 at a time nand there you were thinking i was going to tell you he was doing offbroadway theater nyou silly goose nwell gabe kaplan isnt in the movie rounders nor is the film about the actor come gamblers life nbut rounders is about poker and gabe plays poker and i thought that was kind of a neat connection nsorry about the segue or lack thereof nmatt damon plays mike mcdermott a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker nhes been playing for a while and more than being proficient he has caught the bug nhe goes to all the underground games in new york city knows the regulars and knows how to win nin the beginning of the film hes built up a nice thirty grand nest egg which he takes to the speakeasytype gaming parlor where the big boys play nmike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb john malkovich an oreomunching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia nmike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker but instead he loses it all in a single hand nmonths later hes paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck nwhen mikes best friend and poker buddy worm edward norton finishes his jail term for hustling some students he wants to pick up right were they left off working as a team to part others with their betting cash nalthough mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student jo gretchen mol worm connives mike into playing once more and mike bitten again by the bug slides down that slippery slope risking his relationship education and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life nto make a film about gambling a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters nthis is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth nrounders however seems to go more for the latter than the former nthe card clubs mike and worm frequent arent very glamorous at all ntheres a basement a lodge with elk heads on the wall a goulash joint these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots nexcept for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table nthe reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it nwere given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations and good actors to play them nmatt damon is very natural as mike who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school and answering what may be his true calling playing professional poker ned nortons worm is truly a worm always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what theyre worth njohn turturro who amazes me with his acting range tones it down in this film by playing joey knish a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments nhes both a friend and mentor to mike and turturros lowkey performance is totally convincing just as john malkovichs heavilyaccented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself nmartin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mikes law professors abe petrovsky nwhile landau slips well into the role his character spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to ones self facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending nperhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable lineup of acting talent however is gretchen mol who just didnt seem to have much presence on screen nshes a genuine peach to look at kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel and i wouldnt be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blondhaired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world but her delivered lines seemed very flat and i found myself looking for matt damons reactions instead na good thing about rounders is that it doesnt get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it cant find time for humor nthe film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next in widely different locales none game in a cigar club had me in stitches n i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper says one of the players clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other ni was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys nwith all the poker being played rounders had the potential to be very confusing nyou might think you know a lot about poker but think again nluckily were given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain whats going on nthe narrations are more informative than intrusive and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do nits nice that as the characters develop so does our comprehension of their world nas a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker rounders delivers in spades nwait nas a film about the culture of cards rounders is an ace nhang on npacked with great acting and great characters rounders is a full house nokay i guess thats enough noh by the way if you ever want to get into a game with ol gabe kaplan be sure to bring a note from epsteins mother n
the thirteenth floor the third in what i would call the reality check movie series is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year the matrix and existenz nall three made you think made you wonder what is real what isnt and if our world is just a huge game nthe thirteenth floor doesnt reach the level of originality creativity and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz but it certainly gives a great shot at it nin the matrix we were told that the humans are simply a virus nin existenz we learned that our life could be just a game nin the thirteenth floor we learn that we are just electronic devices living under another world of electronic devices nthere is just one world on top of another and everything in them are fake and electronically generated nthe thirteenth floor took a huge risky turn that i didnt expect it to take and im not very sure it was such a great turn to make nrather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds nafter the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller played by armin muellerstahl douglas hall played by craig bierko a man that worked under fuller for many years must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using to the year 1937 which consists of computer generated characters only nthe simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days nall of the people involved are just characters or are they ndouglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours and killed fuller nalong the way douglas interacts with many different potential suspects and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller jane fuller played wonderfully by a talented young actress gretchen mol nthe thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going and doesnt use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewers interests ni was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz and i wouldnt enjoy it but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film nunfortunately many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened nthe scenes that arent original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere leaving you wondering what is the point of this nsometimes it was hard to believe that this story with terrible dialogue some bad acting especially from craig bierko and scenes that go absolutely nowhere are actually true ni know this isnt a true story or anything but a film should be able to make you think that it is non the plus side of acting we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor armin muellerstahl nin the thirteenth floor he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances nanother plus is gretchen mols realistic performance creating her character with depth not just staying in the onedimensional phase ndont expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile and shuts you down like any other movie would nthrills chills and spills arent what you will get in this film but you will just get another trip to send your mind on scrambling it until youve had enough nthe bottom line lets hope this is the last of the reality check based movies for awhile n
an astonishingly difficult movie to watch the last temptation of christ may be scorseses most important film and yet his most impossibly abstract as well nscorsese presents the life of jesus christ through nikos kazantzakis novel which details the life of christ from approximately 20 until the day of crucifixtion njesus of nazareth dafoe is a carpenter who opens the film making crosses so that he can escape the fate he is subjected to his destiny on earth n yet he soon learns his evil ways for aiding in the deaths of others and subjects himself to a desert in exile in hopes that he can reach god nbefore leaving he asks for forgiveness from mary magdelene barbara hershey a prostitute who is also a childhood friend of jesus n 20 nafter going to the desert christ learns his true purpose in life and what he must do naided by judas keitel he sets off on teaching the world his message nalong the way he meets john the baptist the rest of the prophets and tries to teach the world his message nchrist is also confronted by internal demons and selfdoubt as he tries to find his true purpose throughout the entire film nduring the story judas is the closese ally of jesus his betrayal argues the film was not out of hate but out of love in order to allow christ to die n20 nhe is eventually captured and crucified as per the bibile n however as he is about to die on the cross he is saved by a girl who brings him to his marriage with mary magdelene nthe girl is a guardian angel who is from god and who has saved him from his death njesus goes on to live a life as a man as a carpenter and does not die on the cross non his deathbed in the final moments of his life he is visited by the prophets and by judas who denounces his master for not keeping his end of the bargain njudas reveals the angel to truly be the devil and the life jesus had lived to be the ultimate selfish act njesus escapes from his deathbed and asks his father for forgiveness for succumbing to his last temptation nvisually and aurally the film is absolutely breathtaking nno other director has even come close to realizing jerusalem during the time of christs life to the screen npeter gabriel contributes a score than is simply astonishing with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer nthe performances are simply exquisite with dafoe leading the way with a mesmerizing turn as jesus nkeitel although his accent is a problem is passionately brilliant fighting through language to bring the character to life nthe visuals are also amazing nscorsese frames his movie in a harsh tone leaving the impression that jesus truly is a man who is having human frailties nthe film though has many trouble spots npaul schraders script is one nschrader uses modernday new york english to tell the story along with new york words new york mannerisms and new york slang speech n the film also does not focus on the godly aspects of christ nthere is no underlying message behind the mans words nthe film fails to capture the glory and splendor of christ nhad it faithfully explored that aspect than the dichotomy of jesus soul his frailties and doubt mixed with his unmistakable glory would have been simply spectacular nthe message of christ is confused between love and violence and the film merely tells us jesus is great instead of showing us his greatness nthe film is also overlong nit just drags in the middle with nothing truly happening nchrist is a confused figure in the sense that the audience doesnt know who he really is nschrader forgets to give jesus a message to show that he truly is the messiah to give him the divinity nwithout that he is a rambling prophet who the audience themselves do not believe nthere are several moments of accidental hilarity and most of them occur when jesus is attempting to preach n there are moments of brief awe and power followed by moments of confused hilarity nthat said the controversial temptation sequence is something to behold nit is a step in an unexpected direction one that leaves the audience puzzled until the arrival of the disciples nit is a simply breathtaking scene with jesus about to die as a mortal nit is truly one of scorseses finest moments nit is unfortunate that scorsese couldnt make a film about christ as powerful as that one scene n20 n
it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a i nartificial intelligence just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material nfor here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home an outcast seeking family themes very familiar from most of spielbergs body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e t nto empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan naming just a few examples na i is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies nit is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances nthe last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions and with the number of births limited by the government many couples are yearning for children nand professor hobby william hurt has the solution na robotic boy named david haley joel osment who is programmed to love nas a test david is placed with henry swinton sam robards and his wife monica frances oconnor ntheir naturalborn son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness nthe first third of a i ndeals with davids life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son martin ncircumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons nhe is abandoned and alone ndavid highly influenced by the fairy tale pinocchio feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monicas love for him nthe films second act follows davids search for the blue fairy whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish nduring these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe jude law a robot who specializes in sex nspielberg is at his top form in this sequence offering a brutal flesh fair where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers nhere is where kubricks influence is strongly felt as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots nthe savagery conjures up images from the late directors a clockwork orange nat about two hours and 30 minutes the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters nit is all very anticlimatic and jarring nthese scenes seem almost superfluous as if from a different film na i is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg13 rating nit is a story combining hope and intolerance sacrifice and bigotry and while it does not coalesce perfectly the movie does offer some disturbing images nbut a i nis really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment nif ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination it is this lad who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david a being created for the express purpose of loving nhe shines when with monica beaming with love as eager as a puppy to please nafter being left in the woods he is confused lost hurt focusing on one objective to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mothers eyes nlaw is pleasant as the carefree robot who really doesnt understand davids quest but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey nprobably the toughest role is oconnors monica nplaying an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance but as a threat to her family nshe gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action nmany of a i s futuristic sets are breathtaking especially a mostly submerged new york lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps na i is a flawed film and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering even subconsciously how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera nwould it have been darker nmore cynical nwe will never know nwe can only judge what is before us on the screen a collaboration of two cinematic giants na i nis a most interesting and thoughtprovoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us n
like the wonderful 1990 drama awakenings starring robin williams and robert de niro at first sight directed by irwin winkler is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight directed by irwin winkler is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks nsince awakenings was so very good and made my top ten list the year it was released at first sight is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall but is still an intelligent and vibrantlyacted drama nthe film begins as amy mira sorvino a stressedout new york architect decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country nat the hotel she is staying at she makes a massage appointment and after a long soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil val kilmer only to find out later that he is actually blind namy doesnt really care if he has a handicap or not and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love nonce she has returned to new york amy begins to research on virgils certain type of retinal blindness which he has had since three years of age and out of a stroke of luck comes into contact with a doctor bruce davison who believes he can repair virgils sight even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history nat first reluctant virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery much to the hesitance of his overbearing but loving older sister kelly mcgillis nultimately the surgery is a success but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees since he has never visually seen anything before only touched objects nhe moves into amys apartment and she is eager to stand by him but virgils maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship non the basis of the overall story at first sight is indeed a film that has been done many times before and owes a great deal to its predecessor awakenings nwhat will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance nhowever what helps at first sight rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy nusually romantic pictures are of the shameless puppydog sort the recent tom hanksmeg ryanstarrer youve got mail immediately pops to mind but with this film i grew to care more about the characters and their plight nthe film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil nthe massaging sequences were strangely erotic maybe even more so than the later actual love scenes and as their romantic involvement quickly developed the film was both entertaining and sweet and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two nthese joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting peaceful life in the country to amys eventful life in the big city nthe other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board nval kilmer usually cast in the macho type of role was always believable as a blind person and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears nit was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity but to sympathize with and he pulled it off nmira sorvino who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995s hilarious woody allen comedy mighty aphrodite for which she won a welldeserved oscar as a kindhearted but ditzy hooker is a standout here nalthough she has made some mediocre film choices since then 1997s mimic 1998s the replacement killers she always has managed to come out unscathed and it is with at first sight that she finally has another juicy role to play nin a truthful climactic scene set in amys apartment between she and virgil sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces nkelly mcgillis who could have easily come off as the bad onedimensional sister instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother nfinally nathan lane who is usually a little too overthetop is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist nthe one misstep of at first sight is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil nvery little is ever said or discussed concerning it and when the surgery occurs it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes nperhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more indepth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences but i would personally take realism even if it is graphic any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder nin awakenings the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed nbecause of how strong the screenplay written by steve levitt is in the way it deals with the main relationship and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino the films few problems can be swept over to the side nthe adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is no doubt in respect to the reallife couple that the film was inspired by who are still together after many years even though the setting of the film was changed to new york nsince january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies at first sight comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace n
renown surrealist director the 77yearold frenchman alain resnais hiroshima mon amourlast year at marienbadm lo has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven 1978 tv serial 1981 movie and the singing detective 1986 nthe film follows potters gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lipsynched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts nhe also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct such as the umbrellas of cherbourg and the young girls of rochefort nthe tale has resnaiss unique touches as a director to go along with his homage nit is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person and that there is a song in everyones heart for every occasion nwhat hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers and the farce seems more banal than daring nyet it is not without its striking moments and charms such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs nalso the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else which has always been embellished in movie lore comes through with flying colors nit also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there nit tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness nthey are the attractive sisters odile sabine az ma and camille agnes jaoui with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts nshe is married to the glum and laconic claude pierre arditi nshe once went out with a businessman nicolas jeanpierre bacri who left her 8years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family nsimon andre dussolier works as a realestate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat in his spare time he writes radio plays nsimons boss is the much younger unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier lambert wilson who inherited the firm from his father and is the realestate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view nscreenwriters and actors jeanpierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts njaouis camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph d nin history using for her thesis the study of the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru nshe works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks even though she appears to have outwardly perfect selfcontrol non her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her but not having the nerve to tell her this nto his dismay he finds out she is dating his meanspirited but handsome boss whom she meets when looking at her sisters new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold not because hes so sensitive nbacri as the classy nicolas turns out to be now working as a chauffeur nhe is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him nodile still pines for him but hes married telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly nlove is the same old song that makes the world go round even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are neverything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odiles place as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be ntheres not a lot of bite to this satirical musical but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors if not the best nthis film is not one his great ones but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting nit not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice nit is also interesting in the way it examines its characters behavior as being similar in business as in love n

prior to his psychosis romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his policewoman daughter aunjanue ellis that even though hes a nut that doesnt mean that he cant solve a highprofile society murder nevery moment an exhausting workshop of ideas and every character the same the cavemans valentine is a concept so high concept that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment with romuluss caveman a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlanes urban noir hero spawn nwith a longvanished wife tamara tunie acting as a spiritual guide the occasional social caste commentary the secret base in a cave a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters and a wickedly colourful archenemy the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars werent inscribed with gotham pd nthat being said the cavemans valentine can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when in fact the cavemans valentine is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless again like mcfarlanes spawn while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts nit is no small detail that our hero romulus is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life in legend without knowledge of his royal birth but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park in the romulus mythology signs of romulus royal blood is brought by twelve vultures while in the film the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds but of the carrion itself nwhether or not romulus of the cavemans valentine will found a nation or in the case of novelist george dawes green upon whose novel his own screenplay is based a franchise the fact remains that the cavemans valentine is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far nit along with m night shyamalans unbreakable is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has since millers seminal the dark knight returns redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics nreaders of sam keiths brilliant the maxx comic series or of mtvs shortlived animated adaptation of the same are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne nthe failure of both the maxx tv show and of the cavemans valentine not forgetting the initial backlash against unbreakable suggests that the public may not be ready for americas surprising contributions to dark fantasy nluxuriantly lit brashly saturated and comicpanel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent death in venice ca while inhabiting robin standefers practical magic mesmerizing sets the cavemans valentine is an unremittingly gorgeous film nkasi lemmons following up her brilliant 1997 debut eves bayou which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys artists and suffering nthe cavemans valentine is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape nclearly not for every taste when approached with the correct paradigm it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year a redefinition of the hero archetype for a postmodern audience with urinestained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes nthe cavemans valentine is a fine and a courageous film crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliots rats alley wasteland n

 very bad things is the most delightfully morbid film of the year a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldnt help but be won over by the material nthe film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas nthe groomtobe is kyle fisher jon favreau who is about to be married to the controlling weddingobsessed laura cameron diaz nthe other friends are real estate agent robert boyd christian slater quiet charles leland orser and brothers michael jeremy piven and family man adam daniel stern nafter a wild night of gambling boozing and drugs a stripper carla scott who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room but after a freak accident to everyones terror she is killed nas robert puts it there are two options go to the police and go to prison or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her nafter a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body robert is forced to kill him as well n okay there is only one option now nyou can forget about calling the police he says nby the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer most of them are overcome with guilt which sets off an even more elaborate series of event that includes much much more murder doublecrosses and the inevitable wedding from hell n very bad things which is actor peter bergs feature film directing debut is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that theres something about mary wanted to be nit pulls out all the stops to create something fresh original and hilarious even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence gore and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end nthe screenplay also written by berg is to put it mildly very funny and courageous nduring the second act of the film some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death which was beginning to undermine the humor but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed nthe dialogue is edgy and inventive and this film proves that a movie doesnt necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable ntheres more fun i think in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts ncameron diaz gives her best performance to date here and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends ndiaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january nby the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger and reciting lines like stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs i couldnt help but crack up at how ballstothewall this film had become njeanne tripplehorn creates another character original as daniel sterns wife who late in the picture we discover is a tough kickboxer that should not be messed around with nit is at this level that very bad things was so entertaining and surprising njust when you thought you could predict what was going to happen there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky nthe last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further overthetop nalthough i enjoyed the film immensely let me make this clear very bad things is not a movie for everyone nit is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen it is more violent and bloody than a rrated film usually is and it is offensive nluckily these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a noholdsbarred politically incorrect comedy nthe fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and safe widereleases coming out lately still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry n
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned nlike its own opening shot from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent na sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking nthe film follows a softspoken young man eddie adams mark wahlberg from torrance through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom and later to a harrowingly precipitous drop nas boogie nights opens hes toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity nrecruited by fatherly jack horner a rejuvenated burt reynolds a successful porn filmmaker eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler pornstar nwholeheartedly embraced by jacks troupe including the maternal amber waves julianne moore reed rothchild john c reilly buck swope don cheadle rollergirl heather graham dirk and his one special thing are quickly propelled to the top of his field fulfilling his mantra of being a big bright shining star nhis lack of discipline however incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in nthe element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr anderson whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious nfrom the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool mr andersons accomplished command of the camera is without question nwhile novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating impertinent and selfcongratulatory case in point marc roccos unforgettable perpetualmotion helming of murder in the first in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr anderson be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp is purposeful and potent nits a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmakers career boogie nights is only his second feature film following up his debut feature from earlier this year hard eight and although its somewhat derivative his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman while in terms of visuals hes clearly influenced by martin scorsese at least hes borrowing from some of the best and its entirely effective within the context of this film nwhile boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective in terms of sheer entertainment value its also rollicking good fun with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour nthe film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music clothes hairstyles dance idioms and culture aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent preaidsscare period in american history where uninhibited freewheeling lifestyles abounded nwhile much of the films humour pertains to the characters obliviousness of nowoutdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society a prime example is parttime salesman buck swopes demo of a stereo system with an eighttrack tape and inviting a prospective customer to get freaky deaky with the music its elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule but of wistful reminiscence and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous na giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny to be sure but oddly magical and the sequence which lovingly explores eddiedirks bedroom completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures farrah fawcett cheryl tiegs bruce lee is breathtaking nably supported by a wellselected collection of period music all of which purportedly came straight from mr andersons personal collection theres a clear affection for the era in boogie nights nits the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline the films promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters nafter the debacle with 1996s milos forman film the people vs nlarry flynt another finelycrafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornographyrelated storyline the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public nhowever while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago its hardly a lurid or seamy film given the subject matter theres very little nudity and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality but simply as a business nthe glimpses on the sets of jack horners shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate theres a candid matteroffactness in terms of sex his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job and its refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking such as coercion or debauchery are avoided nif anything boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves njack horners dream is an honourable one he genuinely aspires to make a great film and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence nin both films the world of quickie lowbudget filmmaking is explored and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton scott alexander and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets jacks retort of there are shadows in light baby to his cinematographers complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed woods its not about the little details its about the big picture nrant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false nin boogie nights and ed wood the aspirations of the respective filmmakers prove to be bemusing not in their intentions theres nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an artistic erotic picture but in the degree that they miss the mark nmuch like the humour lacing ed wood the laughs involving jack horner are doubleedged after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres when jack breathes this is the best work ive ever done its genuinely funny but given his utter sincerity also possesses a tinge of sadness nmr anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter nwhile boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging there really isnt any clever dialogue in the film though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the films characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges when one considers that the films protagonist literally doesnt say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time its no wonder why the playfully inane how much can you bench nbanter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the films finest exchanges nand while mr anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters its problematic that some of the the threads given to the films characters are simply stale material julianne moores child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff better suited for a less risque and uninspired tvmovie version of her characters story and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions nstill even if he doesnt always know what to do with his characters mr anderson most definitely captures their essences and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious misguided even aimless hopelessly naive selfdestructive insufferable i loved them just the same nin any case its hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired and ultimately bestexecuted scenes of the year a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loosecannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance even if its a small one in a suicidal drug deal scam only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night rangers sister christian on his stereo system is sheer brilliance flanked by an armed bodyguard nif this scene already wasnt tense enough with these elements mr anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room pushing the scene to a new surreal level of delightful giddiness nthere are some other interesting touches in boogie nights nmr anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight here it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect nsimilarly a painful scene where crew member scotty j philip seymour hoffman breaks down in tears in the drivers seat sobbing im so stupid after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the drivers seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening nboogie nights is exceedingly well cast and each of the actors rise to the occasion the ensemble cast is uniformly good nwhile most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr wahlberg fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films and mr reynolds terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film ringing true in every respect a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention nmr reilly demonstrates here as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbards georgia a genuine aptitude for comedy many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film nim not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee nmr reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number and its wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation nworth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad and deadon period it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me demo track you got the touch in a vain attempt at a musical career nmr reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective nms graham with her long dirty blonde hair innocent demeanour and huge hazel eyes looks like a disney animated heroine come to life or in this case a disney animated heroine who came to life made a wrong turn and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s early 80s adult film industry nconsequently its a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweetfaced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates but in a scene where shes lounging in a limousine prowling the streets garish red lipstick messily smeared on giving the camera a hilariously pouty comehither look all one can do is gulp nher role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out err in a figurative sense shes essentially a glorified extra but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity n if only mr anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face though nand a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish as a teen ms grahams parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers since then her most notable roles have been as a junkie gus van sants drugstore cowboy and now a porn starlet ndraw your own conclusions nperhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr cheadle who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion nhis relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st vincent an interesting melora walters is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible its no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry nwhile the scenario is familiar the wounded look in cheadles eyes makes the scene unforgettable nluis guzmans most famous work is possibly in brian de palmas carlitos way and here he plays a variation on the same character maurice t rodriguez is a hapless but goodnatured nightclub owner whos a hangeron to jacks group ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack with little disguise made of his desperation for a part in one of his erotic pictures njacks eventual acquiescence to maurices request leads to one of boogie nights biggest comic payoffs nboogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr anderson who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work nstriking a fine balance between humour and drama and exceptionally wellcrafted theres no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year n

very few people would be unaware of beavis butthead both created and narrated by mike judge nthey are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind nyou may have seen them on their television program as they snigger and make lude remarks about women anything related to sex and the music film clips that they watch nin beavis butthead do america the pair finally make their big screen debut to the delight of some and the deplore of others nbeavis butthead yes those are their real names are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones nthey live their lives in front of the television nthe worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen nthis happens as they sleep and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone nbeavis even tries to use the remote though there is no television there nthe two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television neven at this point they have no idea what has happened nthey look around seeing all the evidence but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television nbefore the movie i knew that they were stupid but i didnt realise just how stupid nthis is typical of their behaviour throughout the film neventually they realise that their television has been stolen so they leave their sofa to go search for a television nluck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room looking for a television where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife nthis man thinking that beavis butthead are the assigned killers tells them that they can have 10 000 if they do his wife nbeavis butthead being the ignorant fools that they are think that he is offering them 10 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife nthey are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to do her nto them this is the best day of their lives nnot only are they going to lose their virginity one of their lifelong aims but most importantly they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv ninevitably they become caught up in a huge crime and unbeknown to them are tracked across the country by the fbi noddly enough it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds nthey end up travelling right across america visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc nthe irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations their one time out in the big world away from their television they are completely oblivious to it nat old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infrared operated urinals than with the geyser itself nbeavis butthead essentially have the journey of their lives nthey even get to meet the president nbut all they care about is getting their television back and losing their virginity nthis is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny its unbelievable just how stupid they are and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them nthe humour is certainly crude but then beavis butthead are just that crude lude and rude nin the end you cant help but feel sorry for them a pair of antisocial couch potatoes whose life is television nin this respect and also with regard to authority such as the fbi mike judge is quite critical of amercian society nif you are easily offended or find this pair particularly annoying steer clear notherwise it should keep you laughing the whole way through none note of warning dont take friends who like to imitate beavis butthead youll nnever hear the end of it n
sick the life and death of bob flanagan supermasochist nby fernando vallejo nstarring bob flanagan and sheree rose ninterviews by kathe burkhart kirby dick and rita valencia nproduced and directed by kirby dick nrunning time 90 mins nthis film is not rated nthe central themes of sick the life and death of bob flanagan supermasochist are pain and love and its subsequent effect on a persons life nits protagonist bob flanagan who died at the age of 52 suffered from cystic fibrosis a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus preventing him from normal breathing nthe movie is about much more than recouperating or attempting to from this disease nan audacious fabulously triumphant docudrama sick chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years sheree rose who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film nflanagans idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes transcendental similar to terry zwigoffs brilliant 1994 crumb which also explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait but a realistic one nboth crumb and flanagan revelled in their defects nbut flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs he inflicted acts of pain on himself at a very young age courageously defying god he was an irish catholic and turning his body into a work of art which he unraveled in museums and lectures nbehold these works of physical art namong them is a metal ball inserted inside his anus and the most disturbing scene of the decade nailing his penis to a board nflanagan was a man of great intelligence wit and humor as well as adopting a sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking nnot only did he approach his disease with humor peforming burlesque acts in front of an audience he was also revitalized by his approachment nmost with cystic fibrosis do not make it past their earlier twenties theres also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her n nbut the most outstanding thing about sick is flanagans relationship with sheree nbrimming with honesty sensual stimulation and unapologetically sad moments of pain their powerful bond lifts sick into a rare cinematic high where we forget we are in an auditorium and become a part of these people nthe last scene where we see the hero murmuring the last words to his wife in a hospital bed as he struggles for his last moments of life is raw tender hideous nit goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy n
the postman delivers but not first class nthe postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman nwarning my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons postapocalypse stories hope in a desperate situation grassroots uprisings and kevin costner neven worse i thought that waterworld was watchable nread the following with those particular grains of salt nits the year 2013 and things have fallen apart ndue to a world war in the late nineties the resulting threeyear winter and a devastating plague life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms nalthough this is the future it looks like a western nas the film opens kevin costner his characters name is never revealed is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company ngiving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders nrunning into even worse luck he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem will patton nthe ragtag retrofuturistic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the clan nafter a brutal boot camp he and you can see this coming a mile away escapes ntaking shelter in a wrecked postal truck he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either nonce he reaches oregon land of beautiful women bright youngsters and rock and roll he pretends to be a representative from the restored congress of the united states of america nthis scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants nfood and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby olivia williams who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile nshortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman as costner is referred to for the rest of the film become a reluctant item nalthough the postman knows hes running a fraud the concept of renewed communications sets the kids imagination afire especially ford lincoln mercury larenz tate his secondincommand and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through nthe revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists tyranny nthe postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner nalthough the movie appeals to my sensibilities there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted nits derivitive of costners own waterworld and clint eastwood westerns ntheres little here that we havent seen dozens of times before nthe film is often downright corny na scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a brighteyed child is embarrassing in its slowmotion banality nthe films final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor ndespite the films excessive three hour length several things are never explained nwhat was the war about nhow did civilization change so rapidly neveryone has horses where did all they come from nthe law of eights that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film but where nare we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasnt made their way west to help or conquer nthere is some jumbled symbolism here that doesnt appear to make sense nthe tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments but beyond that there are some oddities nthe evil army is called holnists which sounds coincidentally like the new age holism but why nis it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 just one year after many ancient prophesies including the ending of the mayan calendar predict a new world for mankind nwhy is the general named bethlehem nthere seems to be some reason for that but what nsometimes the movie feels like a joke nan army of postal workers armed with guns nconsidering the headlines of recent years it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys nits even more difficult to accept those repowering the federal government as the heroes ngiven the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government its asking a lot for the audience to get behind the films nationalism neven with its numerous flaws the movie all comes together if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have nits doubtful that the postman is going to find much of an audience but a few of us are going to have a good time nbesides were all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug n michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the michael redman arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is to the best of his knowledge not him nperhaps this similarlynamed person should have used kevin costners postal service n
capsule earthy experimental difficult shockingly frank even for 1997 and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops nthe first few minutes of sweet sweetbacks baad asssss song yes i checked thats the correct number of ss are without dialogue just eerie montages of sounds na young boy obviously malnourished is taken in and fed up by several loving mothersurrogate figures nthen one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation underneath the title credits thats far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life something were not used to seeing on screen nthis is one tough movie to swallow no matter who you are but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately n i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences nthe plot is simple but not simpleminded nsweetback hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man breaks his bonds and runs like hell nalong the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies or at all for that matter the slums the missions the ghetto nin other lesser movies sweetback would be machinegunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies in this one we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted nssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x by an allwhite jury as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns and its hardly surprising why ntheres a good deal of sex in the movie but its handled in a way thats unsettlingly frank a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie nin one scene sweetback visits a friends house in the hope of getting sanctuary there and the other man chats him up while on the toilet nwere not used to coming this close to people in real life let alone in the movies especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous nthe movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles hands none scene in which a man is interrogated by the cops is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack nanother note ssbas is not so much antiwhite that would be too easy as antiauthority and as the movie goes on to demonstrate authority exists in many forms governments churches and even the paranoid inside of ones own mind nssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet god knows n
contact is the 1997 movie ive seen the most five times to be exact nfour of those times were on the big screen but even on a tv its a very impressive film nthe same cant be said for films like independance day but thats because contact is a rare example in scifi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects and all of us know looking back that id4 didnt offer much outside of some onetime delightful eye candy ncontacts wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway jodie foster a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of merely listening to sounds out in space nher interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age encouraged by her loving father ted david morse who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola fl that was of course before the days of internet chat rooms nwhile everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence of which the program seti is an acronym for ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive nellies strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young nin puerto rico she meets palmer joss matthew mcconaughey a writer examining the effects of technology on the worlds overall happiness a one time seminary student who describes himself as a man of the cloth without the cloth ndespite the vast differences in opinion regarding a supreme being ellie and palmer hit it off and even take the time to sleep together nits a weak and hurried relationship but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on nmeanwhile dr david drumlin tom skerritt who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding nthis leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation and only a one night stand to remember nit is in this nm city where several months later ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science nwhen the signal is closely examined many new developments spring up and before long drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at neventually it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega where the signal seems to have originated nthe media swarms fanatics go further off the deep end scientists clamor for new information politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality remember when zemeckis couldnt get enough of this in forrest gump nas if that werent enough ellies discovery leads her to the nations capital where she again runs into palmer ncontact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs religion nthe impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented with no signs of bias narguments for both sides are intelligent solid and thoughtprovoking nwhen palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega of which ellie is a leading candidate personal convictions play a more important role than love interests nthe question is can a person who doesnt believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90 of the planet does believe in a higher power neven when the film wraps up its uncertain whether its meant to play as an advocate for religion science both or even neither and in our modern day society where right and wrong is only opinion at least speaking politically correctly the ambiguity is an incentive ndont get me wrong nas much as it sounds like it contact isnt merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film nits a highly enjoyable two and a half hours ndespite its seemingly heavy issues its not a tedious undertaking to watch this film nthe special effects are outstanding though warning nhighly depreciated on the small screen neven so some of the subtle visual effects that will likely go unnoticed by many are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as scifi nthe storytelling is rich and complete and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious and at times even hokey its easily one of the best 1997 films and one of the best scifi films ive ever seen nthis is zemeckis best since back to the future and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated zemeckis now has real reason to boast n
50s aliens vs nearth idea revamped nif you have been following the movie news over the net you could not have escaped the hype over id4 nit promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary nid4 opened in the us on 2nd of july and up till now only after a week of release it has nearly touched the us100 million mark a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 nthe premise of the movie is disgustingly simple earth defends itself against the aliens a typical and highly popular 50s hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era nthe movie opens via star wars however unoriginal it may be it worked nthe aliens have sent a large mother ship supposedly to be 14 size of the moon to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth nthe us president pullman does not know of the aliens intention but soon finds out when david goldblum a scientist discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities ncapt hiller smith a hotshot f18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc nhis squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders he crash lands after a spectacular 1on1 chase over the grand canyon one of the many highlights of the movie nid4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses nacting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle do we smell a bit of braveheart here nno prizes for guessing how id4 ends its just plain obvious nid4 borrows heavily from star wars return of the jedi alien and in some parts of the movie i could even sense a bit of xfiles on screen nif i were to critically review this movie id4 is full of plot holes corny dialogue and ridiculously dumb aliens nhowever below that waferthin plot and onscreen flaws id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion nan idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie thus maintaining a screenviewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable no matter how ridiculous nid4 was produced under a modest budget of us68 million a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich universal soldier stargate and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company nsome of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable especially the epic standoff between 150 f18s and 250 alien saucers reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi nid4 is a movie for all nthough there are many explosions and implied deaths there are no gory scenes of human destruction thus young kids should be able to take it nsit back and dont be too critical chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was nif you are not planning to watch any movies this year please at least make time for this one nthis film is best watched on the bigscreen n
contact is a film that tries to do several different things nit is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr ellie arroway jodie foster and the religious spokesman palmer joss matthew mcconaughey nthe film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals nthe portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable albeit less immediately engaging than say the coldblooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tvs the xfiles nthe aliens in contact seem to be like usthey are more curious than anything else nthey know we exist they want us to know that they exist and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person nthe film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly and between the characters ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey nmost of the film however takes place on earth where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens nscientists are enthusiastic ultraconservative religious leaders are wary and government officials are caught somewhere in between nthe debate is fueled largely by dr arroways atheism she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankinds representative to another species nthe film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches science and faith could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed nstill the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society nthe two sides are represented primarily by arroway and by farright fundamentalists but in reality probably 80 of americans are neither atheists nor farright fundamentalists npalmer joss occupies something of a middle ground but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a lessthanideal spokesman for any ideology nthen again the film does concentrate mostly on public debate which does after all tend to be dominated by extremists rather than on dinnertable or collegedormitory discussions ncontact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues then but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself nthe films one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss nfor one thing it resorts to the tired movie clich that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction nthe romance rarely if ever sheds any light on the characters although it occasionally tries and fails josss explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement i guess you could say im a man of the cloth but without the cloth for example is more like a punchline to a joke than character development ninstead the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments ngranted this is a plot and ideadriven film and the characters are secondary but this just seemed like laziness on the writers part more than anything else nthe successes of contact however far outweigh its failures neven if the social commentary had fizzled altogether which it didnt the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film ncontact doesnt quite cover all the bases but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a twohour film and its rejection of bigbudget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable nand i would not be surprised if ten years from now contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction n

with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresofts square pictures final fantasy inspired by the topselling game franchise is visually aweinspiring and groundbreaking nno doubt you have never seen anything like this film and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved nbut why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting nobviously the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi neverything you see in the film is rendered in great detail individual threads in the fabric individual strands of hair swaying wrinkles and pimples on skin incredible water effects noverall the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue and the times when they dont sync perfectly really stand out since the animation is usually so dazzling nbut you wont spend much time dwelling on those gaffes as soon as you catch one the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering wow nlike the series of games final fantasys plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind hironobu sakaguchi nits the year 2065 and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien phantoms nwhenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors the ofteninvisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul for some unexplainable reason nwhile many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein james woods to blast the aliens with a zeus cannon dr aki ross mingna and dr sid donald sutherland plan to build a wave using eight collected spirits to counteract the phantoms and kill them off nwhile the images serve the scifi aspect of the film well the storytelling doesnt nits unfortunate because the plot seems so intricately thought out nperhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script nsome could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english except two americans wrote the screenplay nnevertheless the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes nwhy do these aliens feed on souls nif they can pass through bodies and ships how can humans hurt them with guns nwhat is so special about the spirits that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens nworse yet the dialogue is scripted to be either like a scienceheavy star trek episode an installment of die hard or a sappy love story depending on whos doing the talking nfor the most part its bearable considering the genre but tedious speeches and cheesy lines dont do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes nthe only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming who always has great cracks during tense moments nbut when the lights come up and the credits roll youre more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked ntheres no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film nyoud be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more n
american pie acknowledges a cold hard fact that most movies dont it is very difficult to get laid nits four virgin heroes are jim biggs a chronic masturbator kev nicholas who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend reid oz klein a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning and finch eddie kaye thomas a germphobe his crass nickname is hilarious but i wont spoil it here who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member njim kev oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women its no wonder theyre horny all the time nafter a party at their studly friend stiflers seann william scott in the films sharpest performance house leaves them sexually unsatisfied the quartet make a pact to lose it by graduationspecifically prom night which is only a few weeks away namerican pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds nalmost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin whoopee nall women are there to be ogled n alyson hannigans perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch nsituations abound that defy logic only to arouse andor amuse its core audience adolescent boys n to arouse nadias shannon elizabeth internet stripteasean unexpectedly raucous and guiltily pleasurable sequence nto amuse jims lusty encounter with a hot apple pie nwhat differentiates american pie from those dirty eighties comedies aside from a very nineties obsession with bodily fluids is a cast thats light years more appealing than that of say just one of the guys ntwo more standouts klein and sctv s eugene levy nklein plays a kindhearted athlete for the second time in a row after alexander paynes underappreciated election ni hope to see more of this warm actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon nlevys is the most crowdpleasing performance and indeed its nice to see him back on the big screen in a role that makes wonderful use of that expressive brow namerican pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents would let you watch growing up nit skillfully employs a broad mix of pop tunes much like john hughes movies did and even pays homage to the breakfast club a couple of times most evidently when the prom band covers simple minds dont you forget about me nthe picture ultimately has a healthy if obligatory attitude towards safe sexeven at their most libidinous american pies protagonists first whip out a condom nthe filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch is possible nfor its familiarity and for its charming leads i recommend american pie but the buzz on this film had me expecting something fresher nas far as the new teen cinema goes its at the top of the heap n dont say i didnt warn you about the party scene n
warning if you actually wish to see the film stop reading this and see it nwhile i dont blow any plot details the more you know about a movie the more disappointing and built up it becomes waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing nbut in a nutshell its a good film nstar wars episode i the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim nnever having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world i was more into star trek the next generation it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment the phantom menace nhowever it cant be ignored nendless toys lining the shelves endless news reports and a multibillion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult nwith the level of this hype one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998 godzilla which definitely failed to live up to expectations nthankfully the phantom menace does much much better nwhile the first star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker the prequels backpedal to tell the backstory of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader nwithout blowing too much of the story the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation and its up to two jedi knights quigon ji played by liam neeson and obiwan kenobi played by ewan mcgreggor to free it nthe phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat ncommon complaints range from lack of characterization weak narrative poor direction of actors the dated style and too much focus over special effects nstill film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism much of which the average film buff does not care for nhence this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films even with the improvements in the special editions nthere are many memorable sequences throughout the film ranging from the fast and furious pod race sequence which is a take on the chariot races in ben hur and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids nutilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail nno matter how many times you watch this film you will catch something new nthe level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks who belongs to a race known as the gungans nbest described as an mr bean from the planet naboo he steals the show nunfortunately being that he is a computergenerated character tells a bit about the direction of the actors although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker nwith star wars mania at an all time high there is the risk that the film will disappoint i myself had my doubts which this film does have a tendency to do at times nthere are a few logic problems with the plot several things are left unchecked and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans although the appearance of the tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs nthat and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character coming off as a smarmy arrogant brat with such an attitude its no wonder why he turns to the dark side nstill it seems that many people especially critics are missing the point nthe film is some of the most fun 2 and a half hours that youll blow in your life which is something i wouldnt mind doing again nwhile it may not have the psychological impact of an academy award contender who really cares nthe film is pure fun from beginning to end nand isnt that what really matters n
linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction and her being cast as dogmas lead is nothing short of inexplicable nshes still in fine form as bethany an abortion clinic worker whos lost her faith none night a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethanys bedroom nhe is metatron alan rickman the voice of god and he needs her help she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey churchthe fate of the universe depends on it ngod would do it himherself but heshe is missing having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again nbethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the prophets jay jason mewes and silent bob kevin smith doing doubleduty the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smiths films thus far nat some point rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus the undocumented and very black thirteenth apostle and offers his assistance as does divine stripper serendipity salma hayek nits a wild ride ntheyre in pursuit of loki and bartleby damon and affleck respectivelythis is probably the sharpest either has ever been who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return nloki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates nat one point he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets nits a nasty guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks how corrupt are you nwings of desire this aint nsince debuting with clerks smith has grown as a director particularly in terms of working with actors n chris rock is this films only weak linkbetween jokes hes wooden nhis nofrills visual style hasnt changed much over the years though dogmas widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations nor has his writinghis characters still sit around delivering one caustic hilarious speech after another ndogma chips away at big religious issuesnamely the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefseloquently and articulately but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition nas well the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever nany movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum hurlyburly anyone and eventually dogmas pacing goes slack na long diatribe from bartleby late in the game in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings comes at a point when weve heard enough nbecause his change of heart bartleby is initially the good cop to lokis bad drives the climax said rant is given a great deal of screen time nsure affleck deserved a big moment damon steals their scenes together prior but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated nlike tarantino smith was a videoage sponge who became a samplemad indie filmmaker ndogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies including indiana jones and the last crusade with silent bob doing his best harrison ford and weird sciencea shit demon attacks our heroes nsmith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan catholicism wow and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished ni bust ed a gut on several occasions nproceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever nits a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease for to read it one actually has to see dogma nthe prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christs martin scorseses 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis controversial novel in that it is not directly linked to the pictures content but to rumours and heresy ntheres a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against n not one of them had watched it nevery single person refused nsmith and scorsese have a lot in common and so do the two films in question because both smiths bethany and scorseses jesus are hollow shells without their faith nin fact dogmas denouement which follows a thrilling showdown thats worth the wait is a catholic lovein a veritable recruitment poster n i felt sentimental about a religion i dont belong to nnow thats powerful filmmaking smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god and that spirituality shines through nits enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins nmy religion is movies nwhen the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine in a roundabout way theyre attacking what i live for freedom of expression through celluloid ni therefore feel that although im no biblethumper im at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers n
matthew broderick and high school comedy nthe two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 nnow it is 13 years later and broderick has another high school comedy election to show the world nferris buehlers day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows nit was light fluffy tasty and sparkling clean nbut election is far different nthis production is a dark and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies it shocks as well njim mcallister matthew broderick is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud nhe is a kind caring younger man who has built his life around carver high school nin turn carver high school has provided a home for him njim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body ntracy flick reese witherspoon is an intelligent outgoing and to quote the film super nice young girl nshe is involved in numerous extracurricular activities always has her hand up first in class and is extremely popular among most of the student body nso it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president nthe metzler family is an extremely wealthy one nthe father dick holmes osborne owns a cement company nthe mother jo jeanine jackson is an ideal housewife nand the two children paul chris klein and tammy jessica campbell are both students at carver high school npaul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school ntammy is a lesbian who to say the least is going through a period of self discovery nfor reasons of revenge hatred and sexual envy jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president nhe claims that in a democracy you need choices and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts nso paul agrees and the race is on nbut then in an effort to spite the two candidates tammy announces that she is running as well nher campaign is straightforward people only run to put it on their college applications then they do nothing nwell i dont even want to go to college she says nin election there are no good guys nalmost everyone has their own agenda nno matter how deeply hidden the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience ntracy is the type of person that you remember from high school nshe is the girl that would be labeled most likely to achieve anything she wants in the yearbook and everyone secretly envied her because of that njim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege and uses it to his own amoral advantage neveryone including the principal a former teacher all the candidates and even pauls girlfriend are two sided characters nthat is much of this films beauty it doesnt have the typical good guys that hollywood likes instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves nmatthew broderick couldnt have been any more perfect for this role nhis character is often similar bill murrays award winning role in the 1998 film rushmore nof the two acting jobs brodericks is far superior nbut even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon nthe hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her is simply indescribable nbroderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes none such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day nyou can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures making her an eligible candidate nand his subtle disgust with her is apparent although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face nthe supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience nbut that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part nhowever the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl nthis is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her socalled platform for presidency nshe is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed nif ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools and gave you an innocent laugh or two then the movie achieved its goal nbut dont you dare think that elections goals are similar nit is just as real in its portrayal of high school as its characters are in the real world nthere certainly is no pile of marshmallows here n
im not really sure what to think about crash non the surface its a cold boring unerotic porn with name starts a name director and some cool camerawork ni mean it left me completely bored unsatisfied and generally kinda weirded out nbut then again not every films supposed to leave you entertained n crash is structured to play like a porn flick but with significantly more plot and dialogue nwhile we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex we also have a skimpy little plot going on mostly towards the beginning and maybe just a hair of characterization nnot to mention the acting is generally pretty good and we dont really see a lot of the actors completely exposed nbut what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience nthis film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of henry and june or the just plain horniness of say deep throat not that ive seen it nif one was to be made completely hot by this film it would probably mean they were also into the whole auto eroticism thing nthe film leaves you cold erotically and maybe in many other ways but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge nthe film opens up on a woman catherine deborah kara ungar of the game pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar nsuddenly a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind the film doesnt show all this though even if it is nc17 nthe next scene has a film director james james spader having sex with a camera woman alice poon in an office on the highlypopulated set of his movie nthe next scene has the two coming together revealing to us that theyre husband and wife and them sharing in one anothers escapades nwhile the two are arguably freaky people we at least know they love to live on the edge nsoon afterwards james is driving down the road at night reclessly of course hes reading something when he drifts into the other lane and then hits another car face on njames is not killed but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat obviously dying leaving the driver helen remington holly hunter in a porn also alive nthe two go through therapy together and when getting out they run into eachother again nwhen james gives her a ride home they almost get into another accident and immeadiately afterwards they go to an unbusy parking lot and have a little quickie as they were aroused by the accident nyou wouldnt think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan elias kosteas and his crutchcarrying girlfriend gabrielle rosanna arquette who are also into it nvaughan is into living on the edge as they are but he takes it to another level he loves to recreate famous car crashes nin one scene he and a friend colin seagrave peter macneill recreate james deans car crash without any padding or safety belts and suffer some concussions but nevertheless get a rush and the attention of the police nsoon these five are all having sex with one another be it straight gay or lesbian sex nwhile this is admittingly all a bit comical the film is almost like a black comedy the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people whos main fetish is living on the edge nim sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents but i personally dont see a connection between car crashes and sex nthe main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush nhis car crash scenes are quick and exciting minimasterpieces were at first not sure if theyll take place but everytime it looks like it may occur we gasp nthen when it happens we hold our breath nthe same thing happens with sex although not in the same fashion nthese people are merely taking it to another level nthe only problem with the film is that its a tad redundant na normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half nthis goes on for about 100 minutes and it just seems a little too long nthe sex and car crashes are far between one another and the time between them are a tad on the boring side ntheres no characterization although it could definitely be argued that hey its a porn and were not here to sympathize nbut still they coulda cut it down a bit nbut the film is saved with its presentation as well as some other elements nthe atmosphere is very dark and forboding creating a kind of cool weird feeling nand there are several scenes are just amazing none scene has catherine and james having sex while she softly asks him questions about being with a man which sounds almost erotic the way she says it na sequence involving one characters death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs nand the final shot is shot perfectly creating an image of a car crash and a couple having sex in front of it despite the fact that shes wounded nthe acting is also pretty good especially for what is almost a porn ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn nwhile james spader is pretty boring hes usually pretty intense deborah kara ungar is amazing nshe speaks all her words in almost zombielike hushes and when shes having sex she has a blank look on her face not showing the viewer whether shes enjoying it or not nin one scene she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her nholly hunter who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this is pretty good and so is rosanna arquette who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role nbut the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone nhe often speaks as he is out of breath showing a definite affinity for his way of life nhe has a great deal of energy in several scenes especially one scene where hes taking photographs of a picture and a later scene where hes getting a freaky tatoo nhe and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes foreshadowing a later scene nkosteas is a little known actor his biggest role was casey jones in teenage mutant ninja turtles but here he shows a denirolike presence hinting that hes capable of bigger roles nwhile i hardly enjoyed crash its still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who if the exist are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world nthese people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities and the film which doesnt exactly pain them in a negative light is sucessful in bringing them to light even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out ndespite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc17 rating theres also an rrated version but i wouldnt even go near that thing anyone looking for a quick turnon should just rent a regular porno n
as i walked out of crouching tiger hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film nwith the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a great piece of work and viceversa nattempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs ni avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology nas the word implies a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master nas such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality ncrouching tiger hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category ncrouching tiger hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore with the requisite blend of legend fantasy magic and mythology nit is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be halfgods greater than life purer than life stronger than life physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable nall the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement nthe classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil which must choose between the two nit is the gifted pupil who under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend nthe elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters are poignantly represented nthe paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively nthe fight scenes are stunning balletic toursdeforce not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art as are the prodigious leaps and flights to from and between rooftops the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake nthere need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry nas in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line which takes place at an ordinary human level yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy ndo not assume however that the art is limpwristed nfor those who are put off by the art label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure action and romance nthere are no weak performances in this movie nmichelle yeoh imbues her character with depth humanity and wisdom nchow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart nzhang ziyi is a budding superstar nshe is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role ncheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably nkudos to screenwriters james schamus wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing choreographer yuen woping photography director peter pau and music director tan dun each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film nang lee as the director coproducer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit nthis is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes including those who hate martial arts movies ndont miss it n
the ring is probably one of the creepiest movies ive seen in years nbut then again ive always had this phobia of asian born horror films ni remember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with those green faced longhaired floating ghosts donning their white gownseuuugh nthe ring really brings back those memories and its grips me long after the movie has ended nunlike the horror films coming from the west im pretty much used to the gore and visual effects so much so they become rather bland nowadays ntheres really no scary movie from the west for a long time nif you have something in mind please tell me nthis japanese flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by the stephen king of japan which is also i heard televised over the air in japan nthe film revolves around a mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to the person who watches it one week prior to viewing na journalist and her husband stupid enough tests the so call urban legend and ends up having a week before she meets her doom nshe and her husband then goes on a search for the origin of the videocassette to get to the root of the whole curse with the hopes of freeing themselves nthe ring plays on the senses like no other horror film today nvisual subtlety minimal music and an intriguing plot puts the audience within an aura of suspense throughout the entire film nvery well done indeed especially for a film that does not have a single trace of violence and gore nnow thats something budding horror filmmaker wannabes should consider looking into njust an idea of how visually powerful the film is it is in japanese and subtitled in chinese both of which i cant understand at all ok i had a friend who gave me a gist prior to watching but he revealed very little nthe twists in the plot leading to an unforgettable climax will definitely leave an impression on the audience will have you at the edge of your seat n
contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagans only novel nit details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway jodie foster nwe first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico where she is part of the seti search for extraterrestrial intelligence project nher research is quickly killed however by her highly political david drumlin tom skerrit who disdains pure research in favor of science with commercial applications nshe goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s r nhadden john hurt nthen with that money just about to finally dry up ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal nin the movies most exciting and believable sequence ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega nat first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before nfurther decoding with haddens help reveals another layer to message containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine nit appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens home world nof course the big question becomes who gets to ride it n right after whos gonna pay for this thing nto boil it down ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith ndrumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform apparently to keep godless science from talking to god or something like that nthen hadden reappears with startling news nhe has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest nellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dreamlike place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father david morse nwhen she returns home no one believes her nshe was not even gone for one second they say even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours nher story is officially discredited although believed by a large segment of the public who dont even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static n n neighteen hours worth of static nthere is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first nellie arroway is a wellrounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working nneither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs but thats a tough standard to meet nellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures nher real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally ndrumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble nhadden obviously has affection for ellie but in the end he seems to see her as his creation nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board neven palmer joss matthew mcconaughey ellies love interest takes a paternalistic interest in ellie seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses nthe film is technically impressive especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine nthe part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain nthe film falls apart when dealing with its central theme the dichotomy between science and religion nthis is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved nthe film presents science pretty well until the end so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith nreligious people are presented as shallow caricatures nrob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank very subtle guys the voice of the religious right nanother religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine jake busey nthe only really fleshedout religious person palmer joss is supposed to be a minister of some sort but his actual faith is left pretty vague ni cant even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian nall we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about premarital sex nthe film drops the science ball at the very end when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith nin a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist religious doctrine this is exactly the wrong message to send nin a movie dealing with issues of science and faith the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism nwhat ellie should have said was you shouldnt believe me nnot without evidence and i dont have the evidence ni know what happened but you shouldnt take my word alone nthat is the voice of science speaking nthe character of david drumlin is another problem with this film nhis attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position nalso his profession of faith before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it nthe last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles nthe media figures such as bernard shaw and jay leno arent so bad in as much as their participation was voluntary nthe use of bill clinton however should give anyone pause nfirst of all lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken is just plain creepy nalso using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 forever dating it npeople watching this film in the future will say hey this never took place during clintons term nthis bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief nalso the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century nbetter to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all nthe film does raise an interesting question although it never develops it in a satisfying way nif we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god or at least some form of supernatural creator npersonally i would hope not since religion is basically an opinion a form of ideology ni would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task n

the premise of the new teentargeted horror film final destination causes a recollection of a memorable simpsons halloween episode nafter attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable timemachine nafter a trek into the cretaceous period homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world nagain and again homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it nthe characters of final destination have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence their design nsomeone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake nthat someone is death nyou see alex browning devon sawa and six others have cheated the grim reaper nbut the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve nfor a high school excursion alexs french class is traveling to paris by airline transport nalex tense and neurotic has a shocking premonition after boarding he sees the plane and every passenger on it spontaneously explode in midair nin a panic of sheer lunacy alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft nafter a handful of others including one teacher follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane the unwitting survivors watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky nthe loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize nbut death wont be cheated so easily and one by one the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances nthe grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi nbefore i delve into the meat of the review id just like to confer nis that one helluva premise or what nfinal destination creepy beyond rational comprehension probably reads more like an unsettling xfiles episode than the simpsons therefore the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong non familiar turf the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong and the opening 20 minutes of final destination reflects that nunlike most thrillers the setup is crisp and cool nyou just deeply sincerely hope that the momentum wont unspool leaving us with a secondstring effort with nothing but cheap derivative shocks nyoung viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration what with i know what you did last summer and sequel idle hands and a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil urban legend nafter the setup when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair i started to really have fun with final destination nlow and behold a teen thriller that is actually unsettling actually suspenseful and yes actually intelligent nsome splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside this film is among the most refreshing and allout enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cuttingedge scream in 1996 nfinal destination stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the bloodspattered slasher crap weve endured throughout the past few years nnot that the characters are that good nsawa is game as alex a connectthedots personality that we never fully comprehend nin addition the survivors are endearing geek tod chad e donella jocky controlfreak carter kerr smith of dawsons creek carters ditzy girlfriend terry amanda detmer the nonetoosubtly named billy hitchcock seann william scott supplier of lukewarm comic relief and a lone teacher the emotionally delicate ms lewton kristin cloke naside from alex the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter varsity blues playing an abstract character named clear rivers what were her parents thinking nthe personality of clear is written with such a vague nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flashcard saying hello i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main characters plight ntoss a few stereotypical fbi agents daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith and a ummm nspiritual mortician former candyman tony todd into the mix and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing dicing and assorted disembowelments nnot so nfinal destination has no slicing and dicing or at least none dealt by a human killer and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening nthe extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying murdererontheloose concept with assistance from a shrewd intelligently paced screenplay by morgan wong and jeffrey reddick nthe plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity listen up reindeer games nbut i suppose the most satisfying aspect of final destination is the murder scenes ncreative resourceful and breathlessly inventive the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a characters demise nwhat will trigger the accident nwill it be the john denver record just put on to play rocky mountain high n yeah sick humor nwill it be the leaking toilet nthe falling fishing reel in the corner nthe murders are startling and largely unforeseen including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward na sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach nit gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes but who cares nits fun nin that simple regard final destination is my cup of tea nthis stylishly executed thriller although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side nafter the show it will also have an frightening impact on you nwhen will your design expire nis death waiting around the corner nthe final effect is a major case of the heebiejeebies n
the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80s nmore practiced as a cinematographer than a director bava nonetheless sat in the directors chair for beyond the door ii the project which turned out to be his last fulllength feature film nalongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci beyond the door ii is simply a revelation nin his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970s n note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcistrip off behind the door but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia nthis story focuses on dora a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco nthe film opens with dora her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husbands suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier nthey hope to put the past behind them but as small accidents start to befall dora usually while bruno is away on business she starts to suspect that marco played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr is somehow involved in the strange goings on nto reveal any more of the story would be unfair nsuffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot loads of atmosphere and solid acting though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english nbava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi wife of famed italian horror director dario argento nher character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with doras troubled soul nthe music by italian ensemble libra is also effective mixing oddsounding 70s rock with classic gothic piano sequences nand there is at least one moment brilliantly engineered by bava that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair nyet for italian horror the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal nlamberto bava and francesco barbieris script is more concerned with deeper psychological terrors with themes of guilt and suffering with the notion that what we sow will shall somewhere somehow eventually reap nscholars of the genre take note beyond the door ii is stylish chilling and essential n
 hes back and its about time nwas the motto for this television series pilot i call it a pilot i dont care what fox network says revival of the cult classic british tv show doctor who that spawned no series which means there are no smart network execs out there not exactly news to a lot of people i know nthe motto was well chosen nthe series was simple it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies including the evil daleks and the master who appears in this feature played very badly by eric roberts nas good as this revival was there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who nis it the acting nhell no npaul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys whove played the doctor including his predecessor and offscreen friend sylvester mccoy who appears once more for the regeneration scene nhe looks right for the role is a brilliant actor and slips effortlessly into the role the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would ndaphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr grace holloway the doctors first companion that he kisses on screen she is not your typical female companion who screams and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor she is a tough spunky american and ashbrook shows this well nyoung yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee and ive seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end this film included which imho wastes his talent nthe only problem with the acting is eric roberts none time he had to say to mcganns doctor i always dress for the occasion nbut he broke it up and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric i always ndress nfor the occasion nyou need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act and whos also british like mcgann is as the doctor nexecutive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role ni dunno who thought of casting him but if theyre reading this news flash eric roberts is not a star nhe rides on his sisters coattails and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him nis this problem the kisses to the past nthey have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them only whovians would and theyre good nis it the script or the movie as a whole nthe script is a classy piece of work featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue and the movie as a whole is one fans will love and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series nso what is it nsimple no plot nthe master on his last legs sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him nthe doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey but they accidentally land in san francisco 1999 december 31 where the master with young street hood chang lees help opens the eye of harmony which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor with the help of female surgeon dr grace holloway doesnt close it by then nvirtually no plot ni was told the movie wouldve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks but a lot of rewriting went on on the set nthat shows how smart people are as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting and that wouldve gotten a four star rating out of me n
in tim burtons sleepy hollow there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name nhe rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe nburtons update on washington irvings classic tale of the legend of sleepy hollow offers us the mystery of the horseman when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror nwriter andrew kevin walker seven throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine nas sleepy hollow opens were greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau who won an oscar in burtons ed wood nlandau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow who on a fateful carriage ride through the forest is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider nafter two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town constable ichabod crane johnny depp is sent in to investigate nlandlord baltus von tassel michael gambon explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods ncrane is not a man of great superstition and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie nfirst and foremost sleepy hollow is a fun horror film nas with virtually all burton movies we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly nthe horseman fx are stylish and impressive particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors nbut why did i enjoy sleepy hollow as much as i did nalthough enjoyable it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right nit was the light comic touch that burton applied nthe film has the sweetness of a candy apple usually channeled through depps wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane who is no longer a mildmannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities nthis is certainly not the only alteration thats been made nas the film progresses it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves nthe momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together because for the audience its not an issue we particularly wish to be solved nits more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive nstill we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burtons keen eye to capture our attention nthe costuming is exceptional and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout its recognizable that the script was refined by awardwinning playwright tom stoppard nthe supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many na blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassels daughter katrina and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent nwalken michael gough who appeared in burtons batman films and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles ni suppose the strengths behind sleepy hollow lie within the central trio director burton constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy nall of this is not to be taken seriously of course nsleepy hollow is a lavish frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children nif youve got a decent head on your shoulders youll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time n
i know that funnest isnt a word n fun is a noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective nbut thats the word that came to me right after viewing chicken run nno wonder this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions like that was the funnest movie ive ever seen nso to hell with websters chicken run is one of the funnest movies ive seen in a while ni cant remember the last time ive seen anything funner nthe chickens at tweedys farm are up to something nliving in a concentration camplike atmosphere they are led by one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box none night a brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farms eggselling plan for a pieselling plan nshe orders a huge piemaking machine cackling chickens go in pies come out nwhat sort of pies nchicken pies of course ncodirector nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscarwinning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and a close shave nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures npart of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was parks uncanny ability to make an old story seem new n the wrong trousers for example pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and a close shave owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories nbut in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived nnow teaming with codirector peter lord park has created a similar creature in chicken run nthe plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for a quick reference to the ballbouncing scene with some spielberginspired action sequences providing the excitement nthing is the film doesnt feel like its been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done npart of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisonersofwar movie starring chickens npark and lord milk the incongruity for all its worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and to them it is nbut theyre chickens so its funny to us nanother thing that helps chicken run and most of parks films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films theyre cribbing nthere are references to the great escape obviously and stalag 17 nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom ntheres even a nod to the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in a little lighthearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibsons nationality and film history nthe braveheart reference is a hoot if you catch it nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution nconsider this since july of last year ive seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online nout of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome nwhy nbecause once you got past the thought that theyre parodying that blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing nconversely chicken run doesnt lean on its parodies the film references are never the sole focus of any scene nif youve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character npark lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before its understood and as a result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either nenjoyment of this movie doesnt require knowledge of film history but if youve got it chicken run is that much richer nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that its hard not to fall in love with every one of them nginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it nshe has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gungho veneer nthe characters inevitable romance doesnt feel contrived but sweet npoor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isnt any help njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs a hen that runs away with most of the best oneliners all while perpetually crocheting a sweater and two supplytrading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swingdancing sequence nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something thats baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome but as with most of chicken run it comes as a delightful surprise nthe film manages to cross all barriers it should be accessible to both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens nthe animation is firstrate nremember that this was all done the oldfashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail nas in such topnotch family fare as a bugs life or toy story 2 chicken run has something to offer in nearly every frame ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but a active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because theyll catch all the details nanyway the movies just a boatload of fun nfunnest damn movie ive seen all year n
no it is not a bad film in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly nevent horizon is not your runofthemill scifi film im sure many who have watched this will agree with me nit is not even original in that sense and it does borrow heavily from films like alien hellraiser and even blade runner nthe magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical buildup that makes it wonderfully horrifying nthe story brings us to the year 2050 where space travel have since enormously progressed nthe event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a mans lifetime nthe ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune na search and rescue team led by miller fishburne is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon nthe designer of the ship dr weir neill follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship nevent horizon is a scifi horror film much truer to the word than say alien would ever be nwhile in alien the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces in event horizon the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying nthe story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud enough ni cant stand this anymore nthere are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime nthe story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also the acting is only at most average by most commercial standards neven so the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film thanks to its wellpaced storytelling disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences which incidentally has been quite generously removed by our censorship board 20 ndirector paul anderson who did mortal kombat and his team of atmosphere creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term horror nthis picture did not do very well in the us boxoffice most probably for the dreadfactor impact it has on most audiences people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this nalthough on the face of it event horizon is mostly molded for massentertainment many thrills spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus nhowever the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing nmy friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the experience of event horizon ni guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us nbe forewarned this film is not for the fainthearted nor for pure entertainment nbe prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film nevent horizon is highly recommended8585but at your own risk nit has been a long time since goodhorror embraced the big screen and event horizon is one n

i dont know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people but its something i used to wonder about when i was younger ni cant decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat but im pretty sure andrew niccol screenwriter for the truman show has had the same curious thought nthe truman show is about a man jim carrey whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public nsince birth hes been living in the fictional island town of seahaven fla which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign nall the people in truman burbanks life are actors and the anonymous townfolk paid extras npeople watch trumans life 24 hours a day live with no commercial interruptions nrevenue comes instead from product placement a staple of contemporary hollywood with trumans friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones nthe sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else neven if you havent seen the truman show youve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials the trailer and other promotion blitzes nif anything ive written so far is a surprise to you then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news neither way you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it because otherwise youll probably think it sucks nit begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror reciting the crucial eat me scene from alive wishing his neighbors a good day afternoon and evening and living in domestic bliss with his wife laura linney nbut weird things start happening na stage light comes falling out of the sky truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father nwe learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child sailing through a rainstorm nthe death was staged by director christof ed harris who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island nsimilar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth not the least of them trumans best friend marlon noah emmerich who assures him hes not in on any conspiracy because the last thing hed ever do is hurt him nas trumans trusting eyes tear over christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else ntheres even a daily behindthescenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of trumans existence nthe key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions nand it all hinges on carrey who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on nhes come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura nmost fundamentally its just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a persons life without the person realizing it how they coordinate extras hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors nthe most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this nsure the most interesting tv genre of the 90s has been reality programming and jerry springers popularity is through the roof but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves nand when news shows use hidden cameras its done in the name of the greater good not entertainment nbut merge the two and youve got the truman show nright now its implausible i mean the fcc wont let you say the sword on the air do you think theyd let you broadcast every detail of a mans life to the entire world without his consent none day though it could happen nand even though it would mean the end of privacy people would eat it up nyou know they would n
capsule suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick which isnt necessarily a bad thing nnot exactly oscar caliber but one helluva bulletriddled good time nextended review you know i remember when hitmen were evil murderous scum nalas the times are achangin nin a recent string of movies hitmen are suddenly wise cracking funloving killerswithhearts nthis brings us to hong kong director kirk wongs first american feature the big hit noddly enough about the same time last year a similar film grosse point blank was released nadvertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it nthe big hit is quite the opposite nit was hyped as the new film from producer john woo so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action nhowever theres a sore lack of it which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit nthe film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver nmel played by mark wahlberg in a dopey milquetoast role is a killing machine he flips spins even breakdances whilst popping caps nsadly he doesnt get a chance to do much of it nexcept for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so the film is in comedy mode nthe action at least what there is of it is prime cut stuff nwong after numerous hong kong features makes quite a nice u s debut nhowever his pacing is a bit off with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough nthey start off electrifying and fresh but just kinda stop nnormally this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable nluckily we have ben ramseys screenplay a bitingly funny piece of work nthe only problem is there might be too much humor one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few nsome of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mels hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism nthe only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled some being there only for a laugh which sometimes works sometimes doesnt noverall the big hit may have its flaws but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed gutwrenchingly funny joyride ndefinately one of the better ways to spend two hours n
robert altmans cookies fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good nit is a sunny delightful dreamy comedy filled with lovely performances skillful direction and topped off with an understated clever extraordinary script nas this is an ensemble piece it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs nfirst we meet willie charles s dutton an honest man with a slight drinking habit nwe then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness despair and want of her dead husband nwe cut to camille glenn close who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora julianne moore nthen we briefly get acquainted with emma liv tyler an apparent relative of cookie who is a downbutnotout teen outcast still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live nwe also fleetingly see emmas lover jason chris odonnell an ambitious but far too excitable young cop nwe are now about one quarter through the two hour picture and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion nwe see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband nshe exclaims here i come nand then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself nsoon after her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl comes upstairs finds cookie dead and flips out nconvinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow yet sweet sister that it was a murder nshe makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well scattering jewelry all over the floor breaking a few cabinets windows and doors and then throwing the gun out in the back yard nthe only reasonable suspect is willie who immediately gets taken into custody and put in a jail cell they all know he didnt do it so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma nmeanwhile the unperturbed camille continues her nonetoosubtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success nso begins cookies fortune a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as a southern spin on fargo except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers darker somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade nrobert altmans slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well in that both films focus on and off on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town nindeed most of the characters in cookies fortune are loads of fun to observe and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi dimensional nglenn close turns in an insubstantial in terms of her career but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie and she is perfectly cast as the prolific aunt alexandria character endlessly obsessed with family dignity nthe equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s dutton mimic a time to kill nthere is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours even days after the film ends ncookies fortune is such a movie ni loved the light kindhearted approach altman whose last project was the dark intense drama the gingerbread man took towards the tricky subject matter ni enjoyed the talented ensemble cast ni even liked the trite in the south everybody is related to everybody cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close nim not sure why cookies fortune had such an allaround pleasing effect on me nperhaps its that good ol southern charm n
i know that funnest isnt a word n fun is a noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective nbut thats the word that came to me right after viewing chicken run nno wonder this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions like that was the funnest movie ive ever seen nso to hell with websters chicken run is one of the funnest movies ive seen in a while ni cant remember the last time ive seen anything funner nthe chickens at tweedys farm are up to something nliving in a concentration camplike atmosphere they are led by one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box none night a brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farms eggselling plan for a pieselling plan nshe orders a huge piemaking machine cackling chickens go in pies come out nwhat sort of pies nchicken pies of course ncodirector nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscarwinning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and a close shave nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures npart of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was parks uncanny ability to make an old story seem new n the wrong trousers for example pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and a close shave owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories nbut in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived nnow teaming with codirector peter lord park has created a similar creature in chicken run nthe plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for a quick reference to the ballbouncing scene with some spielberginspired action sequences providing the excitement nthing is the film doesnt feel like its been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done npart of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisonersofwar movie starring chickens npark and lord milk the incongruity for all its worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and to them it is nbut theyre chickens so its funny to us nanother thing that helps chicken run and most of parks films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films theyre cribbing nthere are references to the great escape obviously and stalag 17 nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom ntheres even a nod to the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in a little lighthearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibsons nationality and film history nthe braveheart reference is a hoot if you catch it nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution nconsider this since july of last year ive seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online nout of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome nwhy nbecause once you got past the thought that theyre parodying that blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing nconversely chicken run doesnt lean on its parodies the film references are never the sole focus of any scene nif youve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character npark lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before its understood and as a result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either nenjoyment of this movie doesnt require knowledge of film history but if youve got it chicken run is that much richer nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that its hard not to fall in love with every one of them nginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it nshe has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gungho veneer nthe characters inevitable romance doesnt feel contrived but sweet npoor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isnt any help njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs a hen that runs away with most of the best oneliners all while perpetually crocheting a sweater and two supplytrading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swingdancing sequence nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something thats baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome but as with most of chicken run it comes as a delightful surprise nthe film manages to cross all barriers it should be accessible to both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens nthe animation is firstrate nremember that this was all done the oldfashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail nas in such topnotch family fare as a bugs life or toy story 2 chicken run has something to offer in nearly every frame ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but a active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because theyll catch all the details nanyway the movies just a boatload of fun nfunnest damn movie ive seen all year n
i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didnt need a sequel nbeloved by kids and their parents respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs that first movie remains a landmark of recent history the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzledazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting nif disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply it didnt show and as distributor and partowner of the property at least it had a piece of the action ntoy story 2 was greenlighted as a directtovideo project disneys standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film nas someone who doesnt believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing granted they usually are a bad thing but thats because theyre made for the wrong reasons i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking nfortunately disney claimed to have been so knockedout by early animation tests that they let pixar go fullspeed ahead with a theatrical sequel nlucky thing too like the first movie this one is a joy to behold on the big screen and technically it improves on its predecessor on just about every level n from a business standpoint the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar while the previous films elements are shared between pixar and disney a sign of the production houses new cachet in hollywood nvisually the main shortcoming of this fully computergenerated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly making them look a little creepy nfortunately that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie where the secret world of toys is more immediate and arguably more attractive than the world of the humans who surround them nas before the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy and indeed all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children come to life in the childs absence nwhile the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves the real joy of a toys life is to mean something to its owner none of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned left on a shelf to gather dust and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors nmost often those toys are packed away in dark spaces safe from sunlight and humidity and often theyre not even removed from their packaging nimagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder and youll understand the attitudes of the collectors items that show up in this movie nsheriff woody voiced by a noteperfect tom hanks the longtime favorite among andys toys who was challenged in the previous goround by the arrival of flashynewthing action figure buzz lightyear tim allen suffers an injury early in the film when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart revealing the stuffing inside nthis accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence nthose anxieties are crystallized when andys mom tears through his living room collecting old toys for a yard sale nand theres an ironic twist to the tale as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum nthe rest of andys toys who owe him quite a debt resolve to rescue him nthat this film manages to turn a box marked 25 cents into a symbol of doom or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma is a testament to its skill at metaphor seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys noperating on this level of abstraction toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness n the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark nsometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard ntheres somewhat less of the seatofthepants loopiness that energized the first film allowing it to surprise and excite on a nearconstant basis and more philosophizing about toys collectors the nature of happiness and the meaning of life nwhile that leads to fewer bellylaughs it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion n just dont ask why andys favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in 1957 nwhere else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at als toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers buzz lightyear action figures nforget the selfcongratulatory science fiction of the matrix this is a fundamental mindbender for buzz and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight nhere as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish childrens tv show that originated his character we see our protagonists come facetoface with god nin sly ways then toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality a metaphorical consideration of aging and death nsignificantly the films very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our openingnight crowd in a nearuproar nand toward the end when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys one of them observes with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking that it will be fun while it lasts nso toy story 2 joins the tradition of childrens stories largely neglected of late that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence nwhats really striking is that both toy story films and to a lesser degree pixars a bugs life are kids movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts not to mention whatever piece of totfriendly eyecandy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer nit puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros animation nim not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention they love traditional narrative too much but boy it makes me wonder what they might come up with next n directed by john lasseter colin brady ash brannon and lee unkrich written by lasseter brannon peter docter andrew stanton rita hsaio doug

bob the happy bastards quickie review ni must admit no doubts single new is quite catchy nit was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back nthe result na movie thats just as good as that song really nit follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend nfirst we hear about a grocery bagger sara polley who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave with bad results as a drug dealer feels hes been swindled by her then comes the story of an english grocery store worker same store who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends where sex gunplay and stolen car trouble come into play then we see the story of two gay movie actors played by scott wolf and jay mohr who deal with a cops strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl sara with their car and finally we come to another grocery worker katie holmes who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer the one mentioned earlier nreally its all confusing to keep track of in review format your best bet is to just well go nthe movie features some very good acting from all angles and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product nthe dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending nthink of it as a well ending nthe intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie as its never really confusing and tells different sides of the story like sliding doors kinda did nhowever its better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks which sliding doors kinda isnt n
even if i did not know that director and cowriters james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the xfiles i would have inevitably made a connection nthe similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon like plot to the mysterious characters to the overall dark ominous settings nit would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie nanother more important similarity is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time nthis is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie especially when compared to some of the trash of the same genre released in the last couple of years urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch nwhat helps final destination is its unique premise nunlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders the villain presented is unusual its the grim reaper nthis being already has predestined when and how you will die naccording to the brief history lesson given in this film everyone was meant to die at a certain time some people at 100 others at 17 whatever death chooses nwhat is unique about death is that its already dead so you cant really kill it nthe only way to defeat death is to cheat it the question is how do you do that nthis dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers nalex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash leaving no survivors nalex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off nshortly after the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal nhowever death isnt through with them yet nit gradually kills off the seven one by one leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again nthe plot allows for some of the most creative original death scenes i have seen in a while nsome scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock ncreativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films nsure it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ali larters character is particularly annoying but the shocks from the beginning to the end are extremely entertaining nalso director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously nhe knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that wont win any academy awards not even a golden globe nthe myriad of inside jokes and gags the characters are named after famous horror directors one character who plays a jerk is named carter like xfiles creator chris carter and a song by john denver who died in a plane crash plays whenever death is near show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie nand from this i had a great time watching the movie n
as i write the review for the new hanksryan romantic comedy youve got mail i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet ni am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the worlds biggest paid commercial for america online nand i wonder is that so bad nwell the commercial part is nas for the movie well as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan i think ill be okay nto paraphrase james berardinelli whose reviews i admire very much tom hanks and meg ryan can act nthey are both wonderful but for all of hanks glorious work in serious films such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan and his glorious triumph in philadelphia i like him best when hes suitably obnoxious ntom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when hes going to get the girl the only question is how nmeg ryan americas high school sweetheart can act nshes had a handful of memorable performances including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally i must not mention what she does due to the well um you get the idea and if you dont get the movie fantastic nbut i like her best when shes well perky nshe is so adorably perkycute that together with hanks they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime nsome people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples but i dont really know nall i know is that i just like them both nthey have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry thats really hard to resist and im not going to even try ntheyre just really really cute sweet and charming nhanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle nhere the setup is a little different nkathleen kelly ryan owns a small childrens bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her nshe is successful beautiful and dates a wellknown columnist with very radical idea kinnear nshe is also having an affair of sorts nyou see kathleen with the handle shopgirl is secretly emailing ny152 nthey have a strictly undetailed relationship there are no specifics and they have no idea who each other is nny152 happens to be joe fox hanks a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of megabookstores run by his father coleman nfox books has decided to open a store on the west side right across from a little childrens bookseller named shop around the corner run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly nevery morning these two email each other silly and every day they fight to the death nits a charming premise and one that works nicely balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have nit also has the great sense of being a classic romance there is no lets have sex tonight mantra if youll excuse my bluntness nthis is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love nhmm well the movie goes through twists and turns having some sad moments and happy ones until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan hook up to use modern terminology and kiss their way into happiness nyou know its going to happen the question is now nthankfully ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey kinnear chappelle and a host of others including a great scene involving brothers aunts and two sweet kids nits all cute and wonderful and for all of the idealism it makes me feel good nhanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is nhe is i believe americas greatest actor ndoes he show it here nnah nbut hes still tom hanks and shes still meg ryan nwhich is what this movie boils down to nits pure confection nall the bits about the godfather the jokes the superb script its all really sweet nthere are some immense flaws like pacing nthe last third of the movie really doesnt work as well as i would have liked and for a romantic comedy its slow nonce hanks knows the secret it gets really slow ni even looked at my watch a couple times to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for so that i could get home at a reasonable hour nthe other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated nemail nwhen my kids are my age i dont know what well be using nbut hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history nthey just work together and its nice to see nit gives you well a smile nthe script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake ni was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was nive always believed that movies are very powerful very powerful indeed nyou see mankind has three abilities he needs to survive the ability to think entertain and procreate nmovies can definitely do the first two and as for the third well id rather not think about that ni always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint and that films that entertained you were good because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night nand i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had nhanks was the driving force behind one of the years best films in saving private ryan which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world nhes also half of the glue behind the years best example of pure entertainment ntom hanks and meg ryan are magical as is this movie nits a sweet lovely affair with a technology twist nit may be a long commercial but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face n
i know what i would do with 4 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site especially if i were with jacob and lou n huh nwell in any event that is the situation hank paxton finds himself in nhe and his dimwitted brother jacob thorton and tubby friend lou brent briscoe come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck nagainst his better judgement hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities nthe rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret and is it worth it na simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things clay pigeons and even fargo and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle noh and its much better than any of those nsam raimi took a departure from his normal freakshow horrormonkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture nhe really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do ni think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course none of the films components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malicks the thin red line nin malicks three hour boreathon he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story nit seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass a small bird or a flowing body of water nsure there were obvious metaphorical connections but there was no subtlty to his efforts nraimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters ni think most viewers may miss the comparison but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film nand then theres billy bob thorton who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood nif it can continute to produce people like thorton hollywood will be ok nhe gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here nit is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade but is is just as complex if not more so njacob is slow and simple and yet we so often see him deep in thought ni wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say or didnt know how to say or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said nhere he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry nthough the plot is somewhat unoriginal it has a very appealing new twist in its characters npaxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group a far cry from chet in wierd science nperhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advicegiving wife but she certainly doesnt do anything ruin the picture na simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty unredeeming nbut at least this one has an important message unlike so many of its counterparts n
in one of my many videos i have attained from the local library casablanca was my third classic in some weeks nthe others being citizen kane and vertigo yes i am trying to see as many of afis greatest movies ever made as i can nbut casablanca stood out from the rest for me it was actually watchable nwhat most hail as the greatest american film ever casablanca isnt so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle thrown in nit seems that star humphry bogart spend about 85 percent of the movie with various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred bergman nthat annoyed me as did the ending nwhy didnt the plan turn around nsurprisingly i enjoyed the film ni liked bogarts character and his acting not over the top as most actors in his era ni once read about if you had a choice to be in a movie which one would it be and a women said casablanca nat first i was thinking to myself why nthen as i watched the film again i understood why nthe movie is very well done and the script topnotch although i doubt i understood more than half of the political mumbo jumbo ncasablanca is in my mind no classic like solaris but it is a good film and stylishly shot nhey hollywood how about this a remake with harrison ford and anne heche nnow that would be a classic n

to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie mulan is a whole new world nthe mouse factorys latest feature is a treasure featuring magnificent animation a strong story and finely drawn characters nmulan is the story of a fiesty headstrong young woman who unlike other disney heroines isnt seeking her prince charming nmulans motivations are simple to save her father serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say nthe story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation nthe emperor has called for a conscription one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation nmulans crippled father is called but mulan sneaks off steals his armor and takes his place nmulan is a saga of courage and selfdiscovery nyet despite the grim backdrop of war it is a lively tale of selfreliance and brainoverbrawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy nthe movie utilizes a strong corps of asianamerican talent as the voices for the main characters including the wonderful mingna wen the joy luck club as mulan b d nwong as shang mulans commanding officer and later love interest pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soontek oh as mulans proud but loving father nalso adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon sent by mulans ancestors to watch over and help the young woman nhis fast wisecracking hiptalking mushu may seem out of place but its a crowd pleasing performance especially for the youngsters nthe movie features only a couple of songs fewer than most previous disney animated flicks but mulans are winners nthe music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot nthe overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus nmulan is a treat more powerful than hercules with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame nat about 85 minutes mulan moves rapidly and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end nmulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain nalso it is hoped that the success of mulan and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asianamerican themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production nit would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them ncommitted to lifelong learning through effective communication n
seen december 28 1997 at 8 45 p m at the crossgates mall cinema 18 guilderland ny theater 8 with matt perreault and my sister jena for free matt paid using prepaid passes nif theres ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non stop action the james bond films are it nand if theres ever been a james bond film that not only proves this but does so by pushing it to the extreme tomorrow never dies is it nopening sequences almost always make or break action films nwhen done properly not only are they actually exciting but they foreshadow things to come nthis film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie but with a sense of the selfaware enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in nfirst theres a hightech slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly chinese waters ntheres definite tension as there seems to be an unknown but certainly hostile third party involved who is manipulating both sides nwhen the scene ends in tragedy its clear theres some kind of powerful conspiracy going on and who else to call on for such a case but james bond nthe film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond brosnon nas the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious bond is clearly and obviously depicted as an outandout hero nhe singlehandedly takes out a small army of terrorists and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the copilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down nthis might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for over using but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly nits not about the payoff because its obvious bond will escape instead its the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it all the while creating for witty hysterical comedy nit seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore because of political correctness and just plain coppingout on behalf of the filmmakers even the term villain sounds passe nwhat the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come yet making him seem completely plausible njonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant cunning elliot carver a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world that is through his massive media empire not through nuclear weapons nthrough some interesting detective work bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news nnot only is that an original idea for a conflict but one which could carry over into reality nsurprisingly this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become nthe films hook is the action and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way nthe story works much like bond himself always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot nsomehow a chinese agent wai lin yeoh bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together nthe chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid but also works because of this not in spite of it nthe two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story nalthough tomorrow never dies is far from perfect it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue n
james cmaerons breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok nfor those of you who do not know the plot in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race nhuman survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed nhowever some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor nto stop connor the machines send a terminator arnold schwarzenegger back to 1984 to murder connors mother sara linda hamilton and thus prevent connor from ever being born nin response the humans send a protector kyle reese played by michael biehn nimages of machines and of humans reliance on machines dominate the film neven though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 humans continue to use the machines nin the climax of star wars luke relies on the force alonehis own spiritual powerto destroy the death star nin the terminator however sara must use another machinea giant hydraulic pressto vanquish her enemy ncameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapableand hes not happy about it nunabated technological growth brings about the terminators other obsession the apocalypse nwe have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la nchildren watch the flames in a burning television nwhen the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him neven though the future is not set there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence nall sara can do is await it n cameron doesnt wimp out like he does in terminator 2 nthe end of the world is the human races own fault too nafter all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place nback in 1984 when the cold war was still in full effect the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war another obsession of camerons nthese days one can read a criticism of machinelike behavior in humans ntrue humanizing touches are put into paul winfields and lance henriksens detective characters but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected ncameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la nfrom a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done narnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonistunstoppable merciless obdurate nwe are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzeneggers later works eg commando but fear him ncameron and hurds script basically depicts a one hour and fortyfive minute chase taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot nwhile we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reeses intentions ncameron directs the film at a rapid kinetic pace neither the camera is moving or something within the frame is movingusually both occurs nthe violence is not particularly graphic temple of dooms heartpull scene outgrosses the terminators but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective nfor a low budget film the terminators special effects and art direction especially in 2029 la are remarkably well done nspecial mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton nit is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen none thing that doesnt hold up after all the years however is linda hamiltons hairdo n
every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre with dramas it was citizen kane with arthouse it was pulp fiction and with comedy it was well that jim carrey guy okay so hes not a movie but he did have a huge influence on the genre nnot to mention an expensive one nsometimes a movie even combines them all into a big sprawling motion picture event as did forrest gump four years ago nwith action films it was aliens whic was released to much hype seven years after its equallyinnovative parent alien 1979 ndirected and written by james cameron t2 judgement day the abyss true lies the authority on action films it was a masterful encore to his scifi thriller the terminator 1984 nwhile the original alien film was a dark enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew james cameron took the bigbudget action film with aliens which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing although on a muchlarger scale nand boy did he take that route nid say at about 165 mph or so nthe film opens 57 years after the original with lt ripley weaver being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel nif youll recall at the end of alien ripley the only surviving member cryogenically hibernated herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship nunfortunately she thought shed only be out for a couple of weeks nonce shes returned to earth ripley is quickly interrogated by the company who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy nin truth they believe her as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an alien advisor nit seems that the colony planet was a oncebreeding ground for the nasty aliens and now all communication with the planet has been lost nit doesnt exactly take a genius to guess what happens next ripley agrees and before you can say big mistake she and the half dozen marines plus the slimy corporate guy reiser who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve are off to the colony nwhen they arrive they find the planet in ruins nonly one survivor is found a little girl newt who confirms that yes the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system nand soon enough the marines come under attack from the aliens nwhat happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien scifi movie the action scenes ncameron directs them so skillfully and so suspensefully that youre literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around nwhich features in my opinion the best fight scene ever recorded on film as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death nmany people will tell you that this film while being a great action film has no real drama and is all cliches nwell they would be wrong my friends nif this film had no drama then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards nthats right best actress nyou know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and fx has got to be good nin short aliens combines all the right elements great action and fx drama a good plot good dialogue and great villains into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time nthen again maybe not nmovies rise and fall from glory and sad to say aliens was wrestled from its throne of best action movie by another cameron film t2 judgement day in 1991 nso who will be the next king nwell lets wait until december 19th and see yet another james cameron filmthe highest budgeted film of all timetitanic to make that decision ni cant wait n
there seem to be two reactions to dark city nyou either love it or you are unimpressed ncount me as a love it nas good as the crow and spawn are dark city is better nwhere the former two have a specific comicbook following the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal nit has a similar look to the others but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent nnot clever or complex the story is still fascinating like a selection from the twilight zone na man rufus sewell is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe nsurprised the attacker runs off nthe dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a womans body in the room na mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately so he packs some clothes and leaves never sure why hes leaving or what hes fleeing nghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city hounding him like figures in a nightmare nan odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i d nthe amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch nnow if only he could remember the rest of his life ndark city is good on many levels nfirst the look of the movie is excellent ngive credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements nthere are visual elements from the american 1920s60s mixed with dickensera urban industrial elements nit is all pulled together in a sad dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hoppers painting nighthawks nproyas use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the films world for not only does the audience see the city a model but so do the ghouls nthe look is like a cross between tim burtons batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay nsecond the editing of the film is good nthe pacing is on track and the plot is revealed the amnesia explained in satisfying increments nalso the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense caffeinated look nthird the special effects are well used nthey look good but more importantly the right effects are used for the right job none example stands out in my mind the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically na simple ripple effect is used na more showy effect could have been chosen but then it would have just been gratuitous nrestraint was shown where necessary letting the more critical effects look more impressive nfinally like gattaca dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance nunlike gattaca the story is just openended and nonliteral enough to be successful njohn murdochs recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night and the hopeful coming of the dawn nhis struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind at least in his world nwhen we finally see the big picture of the movies world it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of a giant turtle na few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave but i do strongly recommend it for its look its pace its story and its timelessness n
tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever nnot surprising considering its tiny us100 000 budget to date it has earned in excess of us130 million nthats a shocking 100 times profit nrumours have it that a smart internet marketing ploy was so successful in gaining cultlike fanatics by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews the film just exploded in the boxoffice raking in millions on its opening weekend nshot in 16mm and video i suspect the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch naudiences are put in the firstperson perspective in the entire misadventure often wobbly and blurry at times it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning nthis is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences ntbwp is simply smart nfilmed to look as if it was really a stockshoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project one may suspect like yours truly that its simply a lazy but smart approach to filmmaking nsimply amazing in that respect i must say ntalk about impact oh yes tbwp does have quite a bit in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing ni did especially the last bit but im not revealing more nyou have to see it for yourself ni cant help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become ncould it be that finally an indiefilm has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal nor was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning nwell i guess the fact stays tbwp is highly original clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film nno gore no special effects i just cant get over how terribly smart this film is n

capsule this is a film that avoids easy answers nwilhelm furtwangler then the worlds greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis nwhat were his views was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter nhow much did he know about crimes against humanity nthe us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation n high 2 4 to 4 nin my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabos sunshine a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes hungarian aristocrats nazis and communists nszabos followup film a german production is much more limited in scope nit is about the postwar investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them nronald harwoods screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich nmaj steve arnold played by harvey keitel has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler stellan skarsgard perhaps europes greatest classical music conductor nwhen other artists fled germany furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen nafter the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes nhe secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty nfrom there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra nas he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation nthere is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting nperhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed nif so perhaps he can never come to the truth nin large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler nwhere the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous nit has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act nwhen it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation nperhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is nwe are given clues to something but they are never tied up nin the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler nthe film is basically a stage play nthe visual is not very important ncorners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location nas with a stage play what this film centers on the dialog and that is intriguing ni rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale nthere is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice nat one point we clearly see arnolds desk calendar say jan 16 tues na quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not again until 1951 nthe events had to take place in 1946 or 1947 na possible date could be obtained from any world almanac n
of all the films ive come to see this year 1997 i think only chasing amy had as many laughoutloud moments nim not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes nand i think im the kind of person that laughs least at movies even when i find them funny nusually all you can get out of me is a warm smile so to get me laughing out loud and so frequently is a really good sign nwaiting for guffman is the story of blaine missouri a town celebrating its 150th anniversary and the musical that is being put on for the big event nthe play is being directed by corky st clair christopher guest who also wrote and directed this mockumentary as well as cowriting several original musical numbers the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success nteaming up with st clair are a handful of blaine residents allan pearl eugene levy a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown but sitting right next to him and studying him ron and sheila albertson fred willard and catherine ohara respectively a married couple setting their sights on hollywood libby mae brown parker posey the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen and a few others neverybody in this movie is brilliant absolutely so but levy particularly stands out nthese characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you cant help but love them as pathetic as they really are nalthough levy stands out guest willard ohara and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances nif there was an oscar for an ensemble performance this is the group that should sweep it nsome humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and even after starting very humorously they nearly lost me with the tadtoolong intros nas delightful as it was it began to get monotonous nthankfully just as your about to say ok maybe i should run to the bathroom they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes nlike a play this film gives a very threeact feel the intros funny but almost too long the rehearsals even funnier and finally the actual performance of the play excellent nlike i said each character really shines even when done with a subtle approach nyou cant really watch these people and not think theyre real people neven they way they talk with awkward pauses and stumbles that dont feel staged at all you feel like youre watching a real albeit funny documentary nand even with silly lyrics the original songs when the play is finally put on are absolutely wonderful nas a word of note despite its r rating waiting for guffman is really quite clean nthis rating came from a brief very brief use of the granddaddy of all swear words neven if that really bothers you let me say that its not presented in a vulgar cheaplaugh way nits actually quite humorous and tastefully done nit might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman nits silly humor but its also so dry subtle and intelligently done that youre not insulted by it nits always really nice to see a comedy that isnt all slapstick and vulgarity and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones nid recommend seeing it n

one year has passed since the last time we saw them and but wayne campbell and garth algar are back but theyve moved out of their parents homes and now have their own pad in an abandoned warehouse nwaynes still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend cassandra and of course garth is still having his own personal growing pains nthey guys are just finishing off one of their shows and head off to an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra and her new manager a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film nagain the promoter is not only after the money that cassandras talent can bring in nthe storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of the original guy loses chick guy realizes mistake and guy gets chick back nfortunately there is more to this movie than this somewhat sheer plot nthe wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and fresh with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne and garth showing their true color nhighlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park garths seduction by a married woman a surprise appearance by charleton heston a 1960s batman setup in the guys pad and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison and some naked indian guy an unexpected lipsync of ymca you could see that one coming a mile away and of course a hilarious parody of those badlydubbed kungfu movies we love to laugh at nand if youve ever wondered why theres always boxes of watermelons chickens and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets youll find out here nthis movie also explores wayne and garth a little more ngarth has somewhat of a coming of age and wayne gets to learn a little about himself with a little help from our old friend jim morrison na few old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again but this time with a few twists to keep them fresh and luckily few if any of them are overused noverall the movie has plenty of continuity flaws especially in the fight scent between garth and cassandras dad but these are easily overlooked as this is after waynes world nthe plot is flimsy but manageable nthere are a few special effects but they are fairly seamless and fill nicely into the plot nthe acting is good for this sort of movie but there are some very bright spots nin the big picture this movie is just plain fun nthere is lots of intelligent humor that makes this film special nduring the whole one hour and 40 minutes i didnt even think about looking at my watch a single time nsilly but riotous at times this is an excellent movie even better than the original n
seen february 15 1998 on home video borrowed from chris wessell nwhen it comes to modern gangster movies its really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre andor just using the word routine nive always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea no matter how many times its been used before can provide for a good story and donnie brasco clinches this idea nits not unlike most of the great films of the genre yet it never apes anothers style as it has a good layer of authenticity even if its core is a tad stale nthe film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it nwe meet lefty pacino an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk nhe and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this nsomehow he comes across donnie brasco depp a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isnt afraid of lefty and his rep and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him nits clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately telling him all the tricks of the trade ni have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit nhowever we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone an fbi agent working undercover a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer nthe first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor a brief history of the mob definitions of their slang and where their money comes from and who it goes to nthe screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements however the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original nmost gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works probably from watching other gangster movies and although this attitude comes across the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable nthankfully the film doesnt become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime and instead opts for character development nmuch of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie npacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would nhes old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be nwe learn of his accomplishments which are quite impressive within their context and when he complains about not being made top boss its easy to sympathize with him nnewell constantly plays up this aspect making it a major theme which works well in the long run nas donnie is constantly impressing and even oneupping lefty its hard to tell which emotion is more powerful the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed nmost of the film tells the story of donnies life in mafia which creates for many subplots and individual conflicts but doesnt always seem to come together as a whole nthe storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar nthe resonance to donnies actual assignment varies he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress but it doesnt always seem to have much meaning nback home his wife maggie heche is ready to divorce him because hes never a and the family is suffering nsince this is based on a true story i wouldnt doubt this would happen although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic nmy only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act or at least any real sense of closure na climax of sorts does occur but theres little feeling of a payoff nwe get a happy ending which is good but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful naside from a few minor general flaws donnie brasco manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development nit may be routine but its good and thats respectful n
