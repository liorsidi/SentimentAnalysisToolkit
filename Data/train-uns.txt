capsule this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film set in the present nrobert deniro stars as a riskadverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend played by marlon brando nedward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime nthe plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense n 2 4 to 4 ni am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before nthis is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens nthere are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment nthere is no rock score nthere are no ballet like martial arts nthis is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and unflashy script nnick played by robert deniro is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks nif a job is not a safe bet pun intended he backs out nsometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe nwhen one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game nhe returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club and decides to manage it full time nhe proposes to his girl friend diane angela bassett nshe has one condition nhe must stay retired from crime nbut before the deal can be cemented max a montreal kingpin and personal friend has one last supposedly easy job for nick nnick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal nmore and more details seem to complicate the job nnicks partner in the crime is to be a smart but uncontrollable young crook jack edward norton njack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat even at his associates homes nthe young crook is a knowitall who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way ntogether they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house nthe script by kario salem lem dobbs and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old mission impossible television series nwe see pieces of the heist being put together last minute changes and things that go wrong much like a good episode of mission impossible nthis team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise mission impossible films nthe complications are however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable nthe telling is cold and noirish which is just what it is supposed to be ndirector frank oz the voices of yoda and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film nthe score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scenestealing acting nedward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is lowkey by todays standards nhe plays what is nearly a double role njack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house none nice ncharacter i have not mentioned is stephen jamie harrold nstephen is a master hacker who lives in his mothers basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions nhe seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon nthe film itself remains lowkey up until the time of the climactic heist nthen the pace really picks up nbefore that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes nthough oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown non the subject of music the score of the score is by howard shore nit adds tension to the suspense scenes but never seems to have much of a melody nangela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been played by a less famous actress who needed a break nshe has nothing to do in the film but demand that nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he does nspeaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s and 1960s nit does the job ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale n
back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its bigscreen update of the cult 1960s scifi tv show lost in space complete with inperson appearances by cast members mimi rogers matt leblanc lacey chabert jack johnson and even gary oldman nthat should have set off my warning alarmsthe last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an inperson cameo to peddle nlast action hero nbut no like millions of others i bought into the hype and got lost nif only i had gotten lostliterallyon the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slappedtogether blockbuster wannabe nyou may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film nat the convention goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series and if that really is the case id hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in nto say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin withwhich there most certainly is not nafter the setup in which the robinson familyfather john william hurt looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews mother maureen rogers wasted daughters judy heather graham ditto and penny a heavily madeup chabert looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things and son will young newcomer johnson making the best of it and pilot don west leblanc doing a bad han solo impression find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr smith a watereddown but stilllively oldman cashing a paycheck and loving every minute the scripts stream of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes alongand hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting nthey encounter another ship nthey board it nalien spiders attack them nthey return to their ship nthe other one explodes nthey land on a deserted planet nand so on nan attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act but goldsman doesnt seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device when one characters past self dies the future incarnation inexplicably lives on nthe look and effects should be lost in spaces aceinthehole but hopkins even manages to botch that nfor a bigbudget film the visual effects are incredibly shoddy nin one composite background shot i could see the blue outline around oldman the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like ndigital effects nbut nothing in those shots is as jawdroppingly unconvincing as blawp a monkeylike space creature that becomes pennys pet nentirely computergenerated and every inch showing it blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game napparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it how else can one explain the graininess of blawps composite shots with the human actors nbut in doing so the seams are that much more obvious nyou have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystalclear solo reaction shot of judy nnew line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the longrunning star trek cash cow at paramount ni dont think so nin a few years the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question what film ended titanics 15week reign at the top of the weekend box office n
a big surprise to me nthe good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues john belushi is such a dumb idea i really had no hope nthey replaced him just fine nnot with john goodman he didnt do much of anything but with the brilliant actor joe morton who can really sing nthe fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant whos ten nthis was another of my fears for the film but hes a really good dancer and plays a mean harmonica although he may have been dubbed nthings that intellectually had bothered me before like no mission from god everyone being richer it not being filmed in chicago gave me no problems at all nim quite pleased that there were less car pileups because they meant less music and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing ntheres a few early crashes and then one huge pileup but after that it all stops nits just the music none of my problems with the first is that cab calloways song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him but theres no problems with this nthe music is all as good as ever tons of great musicians showing up with the exception of johnny lang who cant sing all the musicians do a great job nthe only real problems i had was the special effects nthese were superfluous and a waste of money nsince the film isnt doing very well they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel which i want to see nthe bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide n http www geocities comhollywoodacademy8034 nremove no spam to reply n drive carefully but recklessly mama childs toy the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise npeter otoole n
i wont even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films ni saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3 but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them nso take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard days work ni didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning nsigourney weaver whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination plays the character of ripley who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3 200 years later scientists use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley including the alien that was stuck inside her nin no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two yet ripley is now not completely human possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being nim sure someone can explain exactly why this is so but for now well just ignore it and move on nwhy you ask would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated nwell the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature nthese were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research nthey yawn were wrong nit doesnt take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary unflossed teeth ntheres a little saying that goes something like this if youre going to make a bad film do it well ni have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies but they are not the ones that really bother me nalien resurrection a good example of a film that really gets up my nose is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one nthere is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore which attempts to distract us from the wanderingbutnotgoinganywhere plot nin one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off nanother one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to nfair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story but this is unfortunately not the case and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable nif you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film then you thought right none exciting scene is a credit and the only part remotely worth seeing to the film in which an alien chases two men one a cripple up a tall ladder with interesting results nbut of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis nso in a film where the one liners come as bad as earth man what a shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent its no wonder why alien resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is noh and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies the less i enjoy a film the more i eat nso all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes but however empty the bag turned out to be it was still a long way ahead of the movie n
youve seen this moment before recently a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing nthe difference is that when it happens to lili taylors nell in the haunting we dont care nthe hero of the sixth sense a young boy named cole is a rich creation and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike nthe seasons have changed since an expatient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe willis in the comfort of his own bedroom ndesperate to get his career back on track even at the expense of his crumbling marriage to williams of rushmore malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole osment nthe preteen displays all the quirks of malcolms wouldbe killer scars on his body antisocial behaviour and the reluctance to reveal a big secret nonly after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies and hospitalized as a result does he divulge to malcolm in a spinetingling scene that he sees dead people walking among us all the time nmalcolm assumes and given his profession reasonably so that cole is schizophrenic not psychic but the sincerity in coles anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures nhe will instead pursue the supernatural angle becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole who lives with his single mother lynn collette in the process nthe sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist n though shyamalan does somewhat unforgiveably crib the selfrearranging kitchen business from the latter nits far more heartwarming than frightening and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks ncole attracts the dead for reasons unknown but theyre not out to harm him reallythey just want to be heard even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler nperhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us at first than they really are because were looking at the situation through the eyes of an eightyearold nthats right willis for the first time in years gives up the spotlight to his costar nwe appreciate malcolms domestic dilemma but we identify with cole recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed nboth actors deliver immensely likable performances and their dynamic is manifest nwillis convinces us that hes a doctor something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night nosment is phenomenal a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do nthe sixth sense atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs cinematographer tak fujimoto is actually a dramaits spooky effective ad campaign is misleading nonly because i was expecting something different did i noticerather feelthe movies running time which is just shy of two hours nthe story unfurls slowly but engrossingly its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait nim not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof but i admired its audacity n
the premise of turbulence is im sure very familiar to us all nweve seen it before in passenger 57 executive decision and countless other flicks that are good in there own way nyou know terrorists take over a plane ask the police on the ground for what they what and so on nturbulence starts out with a convict ray liotta being accused of a crime nyou think there is no way he could have done it hes so open and kind nhe is taken in and is subsequently transported on a commerical plane to la nthis is already a problem nthere is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on nanyway it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting to get to la and spend christmas eve there nwell convict one manages to stop the flight in its proverbial tracks and liotta still as calm as ever takes the other convict out nhe also has eyes for lauren holly a flight attendent and seems to grow closer to her n the plot stops here ni didnt like this movie because it seemed to be a rip off of every other airplane movie ive ever seen nat one point mr liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining im serious nit was like they stole for every other movie down to a t nthe only reason i did not give this 0 stars is because it had some okay stunts ndont even bother n

the happy bastards quick movie review nholy man nmore like holy crap nthe film stars eddie murphy as a mysticalish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs jeff goldblum and kelly preston with a flat tire on their hands nsomehow he ends up in their car and on their channel a lineup of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white morgan fairchild and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures nits here that he seems to hit his stride speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales nat this point in the movie of course morality comes into play particularly on goldblum who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss robert loggia nit doesnt take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points nonly a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchilds face seems to have any interest in the movie nmurphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if hed rather be someplace else nsome may argue that the movie has a message but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat nat least he has something for us to laught at n

if only austin powers the spy who shagged me had been just half as original zany silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor it would have easily been one of this summers biggest pleasures nif only nin fact the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another the filmmakers bombard us with usedup tired jokes taken directly from the first one ntake the scene where austin powers again played by mike myers but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff nafter being pushed off the ravine the bad guy is of course assumed dead nbut suddenly we hear a pleading voice coming from down below hes only injured na similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery but here i was insulted by it ndid the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a ripoff napparently i overestimated the intelligence of the average moviegoer considering that the film has pulled in over 200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone ndo i hear the sound of a franchise heading our way nhaving said that though i still cannot deny the film its merits nthe basic plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat dr evil mike myers in the second of his three roles having constructed a time machine goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch austin powers mojo dont you just love that word nwhilst he is cryogenically frozen nwhen austin gets wind of this after a great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurleys vanessa kensington he too travels back in time to reclaim his sexual drive accompanied by the hottotrot felicity shagwell played by heather graham nthis sounds stupid i know but in the movie it starts to make some kind of weird offthewall sense and it worked for me nthen theres minime verne troyer a npetite clone of myers dr evil exactly 18 in size ntroyers persona alone gains the film an extra halfstar contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble on his own minimr nbigglesworth njust try to ignore the fact that at 28 he would make dr evils height rise to just over 21 feet nno matter nhowever there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour and a half the most notable being the now infamous tent scene and that just isnt enough to warrant even a minor recommendation nif there is in fact an austin powers 3 they should just kill off secret agent powers and put the emphasis on dr evil and minime nunconventional yes but theres no denying that itd make for a better movie n
curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy but its humour wont appeal to everyone nto be specific let me give you an example ndo you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated nif you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny dont see curdled non the other hand if you found that sequence to be pretty funny you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at nour films heroine gabriela played by angela jones is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles nluckily for her miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage her scrapbook is getting pretty big nthe killers nickname in the press is the blue blood killer because he preys on older rich socialite women and hes played by william baldwin this is not a spoiler none particularly striking m o non the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims ngabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests nshe immediately quits her job and signs on with pfcs which stands for postforensic cleaning service nno points for guessing what they do nher workmates are confused by gabrielas fascination with murder to them its just a day job ntheres a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk and what they would say ngabrielas partner elena played by mel gorham is particularly perturbed by gabrielas wideeyed fascination and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killers latest scene theyre the messiest you see nunbeknownst to them the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer so hes also heading over there nthe comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental quentin tarantino executiveproduced this film which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival napparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a featurelength film nthere are other parallels the star of curdled is angela jones the top billing goes to william baldwin but really jones is the central character whos probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos the deathobssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction nthat role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film curdled jr njones is great in curdled shes wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wideeyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her characters innocence or likeability nshe can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow nits a great performance nreb braddocks direction is extremely sharp and clever toeing the line between black humour and bad taste nthe best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing any more than that would be a spoiler nthe opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing nof course its impossible to really take this stuff seriously but then again youre not really supposed to braddock knows the audience is in on the joke and makes it a fun little romp as a result nthe one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film and it feels like it the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time and some parts just seem to drag nwhile its running time is already a short 94 minutes it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing ncurdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax nitll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well n
hey ive got a great idea for a movie nok here it is well get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so nwhats that nsounds too boring nok how about this then we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours but half of them are angry looks and half of them are im in pain nlooks nwhats that nthat still doesnt sound funny to you nhow about if we through in some ewwwww nlooks nstill not funny nif you answered no that doesnt sound funny then ding ding ding nyoure absolutely correct nfor richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple played by tim allen and kirstie alley who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant wayne knight best know as newman on tvs seinfeld gets them in trouble for tax evasion nwhat ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell nwhat makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs n n nnamely talent nbacking up the married couple is brad and caroline sexton allen and alley a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else but in reality are on the brink of divorce njust as their marriage seems to be hanging from its final thread brad discovers that his accountant bob lachman knight has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sextons names nthe irs catches on but since everything points back to the sextons and not lachman there is nothing much to do n n nexcept run away and join an amish community nfirst time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckleoutloud moments and even some decent laughs here and way over there but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that youll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn nalley is absolutely unwatchable and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade which i inform you was total b s nallen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons nor are they very convincing as an amish couple nthis entire movie is one bad illconceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning nthe amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing nits such a trite stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast noticing that theyre all predominantly tv figures were probably the only ones they could get nbryan spicers directing doesnt help one bit either nin fact listing spicers filmography which includes the first power rangers movie and the big screen adaption of mchales navy is more of an insult than a r sum nnow that ive pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground i will let you in on the best thing about it nit bumped seven films up a notch on my worst of 1997 movie list nthats right thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the years worst six films are now not seemingly as bad and a smile like yours previously inhabiting the number ten spot now doesnt have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list nif you look at it in that respect for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all n

 minor plot spoilers in review no major spoilers are in review nthe previous two alien films have each had their own unique styles to them nthe ridley scotts alien was very much a stylistic suspense film njames camerons aliens was much more of an action film nand i liked each film separately for which it was nnow alien 3 is out nand it is its own film in the same right that alien and aliens were nunlike aliens alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens nthis is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off nthe survivors of the expedition to lv426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens nthe climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item an egg nin the opening sequence we see the egg hatch find its quarry which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel nthis vessel crash lands on fury 109 neveryone in the vessel is killed except ripley nthe facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash nfury 109 is an exminingmaximum security prison nwhen closed down some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet nall the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years nripleys arrival sparks a problem with the inmates nas for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoners sport there is an infestation of lice on the planet nbeing an exprison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons nso the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own ni will not go into detail but you can guess what happens here nthe alien is loose and no one believes ripleys outstanding story nshe finds comfort in the arms of the colonys doctor nyes after 57 years ripley has sex nit is not gratuitous in fact we dont even see them kiss but it is just as well na sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film nthere is a lot more gore in alien 3 nin fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two nit also sports a new alien with 4 legs ni wont say how but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 nsigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character nher scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination nthe rest of the cast is also quite good nnotably charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 nalien 3 has a very distinct look nthis is due largely to its director david fincher nmr fincher who until now has only directed music videos and commercials has done an incredible job here nhis direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no alien film has before nfor mr fincher i see a long prosperous career ahead of him nthe music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry nelliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the alien series been set in nthis time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii james horners aliens nthis score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring nthis is a great score nthe ending to alien 3 is quite good nthere were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up but it played very nicely ni will not ruin the ending for you ngo see the film ni consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season nalien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien nand when they make alien 4 perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in n
making your first feature film aint easy nassemble a decent if not strong cast as writerdirector robert moresco has done with one eyed king and youre already ahead of the game nbut rehash old plot lines tired dialogue and standard clich s and a wellintentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film nhow many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse nthe enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another but here we have it nagain nfive irish kids in nycs hells kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop nwith teary music nand slow motion nin the films first scene nthe kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen nleading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a goodhearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante nid like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah blah blah but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points nhes concerned about buddy jason gedricks heroin abuse nhe sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwins characters sister nhe looks into who might be pushing the most moroniclooking counterfeit cash ever made a genuinely funny touch nbut none of this ever really amounts to anything nit seems that morescos greater concern is to provide that intangible slice of life that flavor of the neighborhood that everyones been trying to evoke since scorseses early work nso we get the drunk guys hugging and singing together at the local bar to prove to us that they really love each other n do people actually do this nwe get a lot of tough street talk usually mumbled for effect and a whole lot of the fword whether it sounds like it fits or not nwe also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose nbruno kirby chazz palminteri you know guys youve seen in movies just like this one before nassante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears and baldwins performance is adequate but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that its almost funny nmoresco a theater guy and sometimes tv writer including the series falcone obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child but the content is probably too personal nas a result the movies style is heavyhanded in need of a considerable amount of toning down nnearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids moresco reminds us boy does he remind us nwith slow dissolves to the earlier scene running in slow motion complete with dialogue from the present just in case we dont comprehend the link to the past nmoresco needs to either trust his audiences intelligence or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it nhis next project should have a little more personal distance and a lot more subtlety nif he actually gets that chance nreviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage feature story coming soon n

bad bad nbad nthat one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls nif that summary isnt enough for you how about ta ta ta nstill havent got the point nother than director russ meyers predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the aforementioned anatomical areas there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie nthat is the fact that it was cowritten by famed film critic roger ebert who also was responsible for the screenplay nafter watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face nthis movie stinks out loud nquite frankly this movie deserves a nbut there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny nso im giving it a nand maybe that is too generous nright from the opening credits i knew that i had a classa bomb on my hands nnot only are the way the credits actually shot distracting but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform ni had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening it does get explained later and as soon as the first scene is over we cut to a completely unrelated scene nto be honest as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film nwith the quality of the writing during the rest of the film it wouldnt have surprised me if the opening had never been explained nso what is this movie about nyou ask nlike it really matters nok here goes nthis allgirl band headed by kelly macnamara dolly reed and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry nonce there they do manage to find success due as much to their hooters as anything else it sure wasnt for their brutally bad singing voices and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them neverything from big egos to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral nthere are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing nfrom a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here nother than the abovementioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have nthe dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts nmr ebert has generously thrown in helpings of hey man dig and my all time favorite this is my happening and it freaks me out nnow i ask you with lines like that how can you go wrong nebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue nmaybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter ni dont know but all the big words in the world wouldnt be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting nbut the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie nive seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey nin fact there is one scene the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries nadd to the directing and writing the music in this movie ni almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers nthen we have the cast nfirst lets start david gurian who played harris the manager of the band nthis has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera nsadly his acting doesnt come close to making up for his looks nif you have been following along up to this point this shouldnt surprise you nmeyers stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets ndolly reed plays kelly the leader of the band nand no surprise here she was cast for her cup size not her talents nand yes she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents nsadly her ass is almost as large as her chest nhey it a sexist movie so im writing a sexist review nthen we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey one of the other band members nthis goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie nmeyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all nsure russ now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows non the up side she does have a fun lesbo scene ni sound like im writing a review in a porn magazine nbut hey ill admit it the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked nand since that was a huge disappointment i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey nthe only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it nunless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too nand if you are thinking of checking it out for the double ds you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet nthis is a movie that should be avoided at all costs nan even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls beware this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense nproceed with extreme caution n
lets face it since waterworld floated by the summer movie season has grown very stale nwith no new eyecandy for four weeks straight weve had to sustain ourselves on the quasinutritional value of cheatin husbands traveling chocolate salesmen and computer generated serial killers nsigh nthank god for desperado nthe freewheeling sequel to el mariachidirector robert rodriguezs notorious 7000 debutstars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name nhes a man in black with revenge on his mind and an arsenal in his case n the woman he loved was killed in the first film nso he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers sort of a texmex version of the punisher if you will nthere isnt much of an emotional core to desperado nrodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo n and sergio leone nand sam peckinpah nsome may wince at the body countat least 100 graphic killings is a fair estimatebut its all played for laughs nbig broad hispanic laughs that for me recall the physical comedy of blake edwards and his pink panther films nsick slick fun n
capsule the much anticipated readaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting but very little intelligence nvisually there is much to like about this version but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gullivers travels and treat it as an action film nthat makes it a film without much center n 0 4 to 4 npierre boulle author of the bridge on the river kwai wrote planet of the apes a k a monkey planet the novel as a social satire nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gullivers travels nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swifts island of the houyhnhnms nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals but perhaps i was just looking for that nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 he added a number of serling touches familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serlingish nthe final irony of the original version has become film history nwithout it there could never have been a planet of the apes film series ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language nthat could have been done in the film but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the nonapespeaking nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and of course there is some justification for that by the end of the film njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending nbut serling never tackles the allimportant question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language a language they had no opportunity to ever hear nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole however and the film has become well respected in cinema history npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmiths best if not his best nwhen the films success called for sequels the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added wellintentioned though not very subtle political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half hearted by the second film beneath the planet of the apes there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book burtons new version is even less faithful nfirst he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes nhe has them both be intelligent articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands uh make that paws of the apes nthat could be a good story too but it is not planet of the apes nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring nin 2029 leo davidson mark wahlberg not this worlds most expressive actor works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizardofozfashion and drops him on an alien planet n yes he survives this storm but then no storm is perfect nhe quickly finds not greatly to any surprise he shows that on this planet apes rule and humans drool but everybody talks nand the language they talk is earth english napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didnt occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at humananimal relationships and more one of the masterslave relationships noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari played by helena bonham carter nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power nshe is bent on making the world a better place nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hilari nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes nthis is a further abandonment of the source material nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of eachs place in this reversed society each important in the book nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn nthis is a miscalculation as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win nthe 1968 script had little subtlety with lines like i never met an ape i didnt like but at least we cared for what happened to taylor the main character nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup nin general it seems much improved from 1968 nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers who did it for the 1968 version nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jawdropper nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion nchambers is good but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker ntoday audiences have higher expectations bakers visualization is really an improvement nthese visuals work nicely nwhat does not work is the wire assisted leaps some of the apes make nthey look like they were inspired by the physics defying leaps of crouching tiger hidden dragon napes spring incredible distances nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people closeup nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy makeup nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti nit is not that his lines are so good most are silly jokes nbut he delivers them very well nhe was always a watchable actor but has not yet made stardom nas the apetrader limbo he overemotes to overcome his ape makeup but does it very well nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinovs performance in spartacus nas an injoke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself ndanny elfmans score has a nice primitive feel but jerry goldsmiths 1968 tour de force score is a real classic nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film

shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen nit is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies nthat is however not to say it is a good film a quality production or anything of the sort nshakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work nthe finest sign of this may be the plot in looking back there seems to be little more than a thin predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books nphilip henslowe geoffrey rush owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london nit is at the peak of the royal theatre era and queen elizabeth the recently damed judi dench by appropriately enough queen elizabeth ii is very much a fan nhowever to directly quote the film he has cash flow problems nthrough a long set of events it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts nso mr henslowe employs the young playwright william shakespeare joseph fiennes to pen a comedic production nhowever the young writer has a severe case of writers block and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well nhe has the title in mind romeo and ethel the pirates daughter even that joke loses steam after a while but cant seem to put words to paper nthen as only hollywood could have it through a long set of twisted events he meets viola de lesseps gwyneth paltrow and falls madly in love thus curing his writers block nthere are many other little issues that mr henslowe encounters but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing nthe first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to its author nironically that couldnt be truer here nthe great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors none of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love nso it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a characters name in the credits nthe acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeths theatres njoseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though nhe is tragically unbelievable and comically bad ngwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well nhowever the supporting cast does almost save the day ngeoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking nthey both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links nyou will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting no armageddon doesnt qualify as real acting nand rupert everett was cute in his small part as well nbut not even they could save this sad excuse for a film so it remains plagued by poor performances nwhen all is said and done shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained nhowever as the film so kindly pointed out entertainment may be fun but it isnt necessarily quality nand this certainly isnt quality nperhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work nsimply put it is farfetched poorly crafted but very entertaining n
capsule a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg njoe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs nit lets us see some new dinosaurs is that an oxymoron and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure nthe film is neither ambitious nor pretentious ni had a good time n low 2 4 to 4 nhere goes my credibility nthis is a film on which i expect to be in a minority ni liked the third jurassic park film ni even liked the second jurassic park film nin a lot of ways jurassic park the lost world was a creative threeway braiding together of michael crichtons novel the lost world arthur conan doyles novel the lost world and the classic silent film version of the doyle njp2 was an adventure as doyle said for the boy whos half man or the man whos half boy nthat is what all the jurassic park films are nexpecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house nthe classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomons mines had underwritten characters also njurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs nthe characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting nsome of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds nthat degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require ni feel i got my moneys worth nthe story opens with eric played by trevor morgan and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica nthis was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park nthey hope no doubt to get a look at the islands dinosaurs from a safe height nthe height is safe but driving the boat in the water is not nthe two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended nflash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant sam neill in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide nhe has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs nbut again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go ndoing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple william h macy and tea leoni who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs nthey too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn nhe will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once nright nguess what happens next njp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 nfirst it has alan grant and ellie sattler laura dern back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm nsattler has a much smaller part in jp3 but is still present to tie this story to the first ncuriously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance none thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time nthey did not appear to be conversing in the previous films nof course these raptors look a little different also so perhaps they are a different related species nnot only are they more intelligent than in the past films they are also more sympathetic nin this story they are not just killing machines they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition nthis time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized neach new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs of course nin this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus but larger and presumably more nasty nit has a crocodiles head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright nperhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs nsometimes they just move too fast to see noccasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision na few times we get unconvincing matte shot particularly of the laboratory nbut there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films nthe musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williamss score for the first film njoe johnston who directs already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky na team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay nthe film they have made is a long way from great cinema but it still is fun nif you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today the film is for you ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale n
we could paraphrase michelle pfieffers character in dangerous minds and say that beyond rangoon starts with an a nthats fair enough nall movies like all school children should be given the benefit of the doubt nthe chance to succeed nafter all we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders nmountains can be moved and good movies can be made nyeah right nchildren fail as do films nas does director john boormans latest nthe success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette ed wood true romance as the busty westernerinperil wandering about 1988 burma without a passport nthough we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there its a tougher task to overlook the actress nshes a lightweight nas the first scene with narration ndemonstrates she doesnt have nearly enough range for the emotions that her charactera mother fleeing the memories of a murdered husband and sonis supposed to show nshe may give a stronger performance than say keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds by not by much nbeyond rangoon is a very physically appealing film thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman deliverance excalibur hope and glory nhe keeps the narrative moving no matter how muddy the storyor the heroinegets nwhy he chose arquette remains a mystery though nmaybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies nbut even after an hour of halfstated political statements and murky mass killings we still dont know enough of whats happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations nempty exoticism nthe technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix combining lush jungle photography with bad bluescreen work nalso odd is the obvious dubbing ndone to make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign nand is it my mistake or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers ndoo doo doo doo n twilight zone theme or opinion of movie nyou be the judge n

georges polti once wrote a paper called the thirtysix dramatic situations in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirtysix different situations nthis may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes theres nothing new under the sun nthe faculty the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion ntheres not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing ndrawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers screenwriter kevin williamson of scream 2 credit gives us a horror tale set in middle america ohio one eventful fall nmaking use of a cast of unusually stock characters williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence daystyle but rather through the back door nparasitic aliens take over the faculty of a rundown high school and soon have infested most of the student body leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day nthe lack of gusto is the movies major stumbling block neven though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this theyve been saved by an energetic approach nthis casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamsons ability who enjoyed success with the wes cravendirected scream but couldnt pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer nalthough he designs the faculty with more of a scifi bent than his typical slasher picture it still comes down to the same results throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive non that level the main roles are played by virtual unknowns nonly the recognizeable elijah wood deep impact is at the front other than that the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers nperhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these upandcomers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved but to do that theyd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la dawsons creek nneedless to say the acting is far from top notch nor does necessity ask that it should be nthere is a moment or two of genuine horror but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the scifi direction to make any use of it nin sum the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off n

i rented this movie with very high hopes nthis movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 and unfortunately was not as good as i hoped but was still very intriguing and thought provoking nfirst of all the casting for this film is great ntobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood nthey play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly nwith a plot as unbelievable as this film you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast ntobey and reese bud and mary sue parker play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability nwilliam h macy an actor i have grown to love over the past year turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife a colored person and his friends the noncolored ones nhe also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife nhe does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood njoan allen is equally great as betty parker the ideal tv mom nher character is the most ambitious nshe is very na ve and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that nher lack of chemistry with macy which the role calls for and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast then this film would even been even better nas said before jeff daniels gives a bad performance nhis character displays the change going on throughout the town yet he does not display it with enough conviction nhis character is very confusing and he is not very believable nthis film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance nthe movie is very provocative nit challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today ni really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing nthey demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch but do it in a slow pace nthe only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length nsome films are not meant to be that long npleasantville is one of those films nthis film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it nfirst they are amazed by the implementation of color nthen they want to have it nthen they do not want to nthen the war ensues between the colored and noncolored nthis is all strung out over two hours which was way too long nsome movies need a lot of time nsaving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time nthis film is only two hours long and seems much longer nlength is everything in films nif you can nail down the perfect timing and pace you can win half the battle npleasantville can move at a good pace at times but it is not consistent enough noverall pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days ni went in expecting a lighthearted film about change ni left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change nluckily pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences nonly if it could have done in a shorter amount of time n
the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summers other comic book adaptation batman and robin nboth films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts but also their monosyllabic dialogue and emptyheaded character motivations nin panelsized morsels implausible plots and rambo esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork but on thirty foot silver screens its much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures nspawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons white who is framed by a corporate baddie played without irony by sheen then set on fire and left for dead nthough the movie skimps on the next few plot points heres what i could determine said assassin then becomes the leader of satans army under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown leguizamo grating as always nhe is renamed for reasons unbeknownst spawn and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon nbut when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child he realizes that he cant be the evil superdemon hes expected to be and he sets about avenging his untimely death ntypical of summer blockbusters spawn is an effectsladen ninety minute rock video nwhile the visions of hell are laughably crude think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man spawns prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold nbut the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion spawn longs for his wife but they dont have a single scene together before simmons death conflict who will triumph is not anybodys guess and believability not that i expected it nso many questions are left unanswered and im sure they wont be addressed in the inevitable sequel nwhile last years the crow city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative which was lazy and somewhat incoherent it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power nspawn is an inyourface screaming banshee of a film these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid but they havent the faintest idea how to make a movie n
martin scorseses kundun which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure npersonally i dont think it needs one it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china nscorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do as a largerthanlife symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal nthe set design and cinematography are outstanding and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao npolitical art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans kundun does not it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative n

how do you judge a film that is so bad but intentionally so nin spiceworld the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it nif that was their goal they did a fantastic job nso is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasnt really meant to be much better than this nhonestly id rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades so does that mean i graded it inaccurately ntruth be known i dont really think i can answer this question nto understand spiceworld you have to understand the spice girls nunless youre very very young or fairly older you probably have at least heard of them ntheyre a group of five busty british babes whove had 1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions ntheyre primarily adored by preteen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spices real name geri haliwell wonderbra nall five of the girls have these spicy names for which they are better known than their real names nthere is the aforementioned ginger spice as well as sporty spice melanie chisholm or mel c scary spice melanie brown or mel b baby spice emma bunton and posh spice victoria addams and all of them to some degree or another resemble their stage names nthe spice girls took the world by storm and spiceworld is actually a good humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame nits quite nice to see what good sports the girls are and not just the one dubbed sporty about poking fun at themselves nthey dont take themselves too seriously and thats probably the best thing about them nits also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera acting and not just singing and dancing ntheyre not flawless by any means but for the most part they deliver their lines without feeling staged and like them or not we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters which seems reasonable since they portray themselves nwhat makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls wont get enough of their music while the rest of us dont get enough of a movie nthe real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes nmost of the film is very blas but several parts are downright boring and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud nif youre a big fan of the group you probably wont get enough of what you want and if youre not a big fan you get too much time devoted to nothing more than look at us moments nfor the right crowd the music video sequences will be the highlights of the film but for others they will serve as threeminute lulls in a hecticbutoveralluneventful storyline nother key actors include richard e grant as clifford the spice girls manager alan cumming as the filmmaker piers cuthertonsmyth who attempts to make a documentary of the group george wendt as martin barnfield a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie and roger moore in a small selfparodizing role nall provide relatively good performances keeping in mind once again that this film wasnt meant to be acted seriously neven meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it nwhile this film is continuously compared to the beatles a hard days night i think that is an unjust comparison nit is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits but i dont think drector bob spiers nor the spice girls intended it to be so ni think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film and have instead come off rather pretentious ni dont think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun satirical look at a group that got so big a movie seemed the next likely step nand what couldve been better than a selfindulged yet self mocking approach nprobably nothing and so it is nspiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy but now instead i find myself wanting to defend a movie i didnt even give a good review nits bad but it succeeds in every way it intended nit gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment nperhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick nif thats the case the movies gimmick is that it is such a gimmick nyou might be saying a spice girls movie ncome on but when it comes down to it i think thats the point n

 soldier by director paul anderson is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting nthe best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russels character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision nbrutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it and the opening scenes tap into it a little nthen it goes nowhere with that idea nthere is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches ive ever seen nthe whole idea of the inhuman soldiertype character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done and its been done much better ni was able to predict the plot of the whole story which wouldnt be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting nbetween the action sequences it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes since his dialog is extremely limited nhis performance in that way isnt all that bad but certainly is not enough to carry this film nother performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all and they generally are about as weak as their characters nbut enough of this stuff about plot and character right nisnt the most important part of an action film well the action neven in this aspect the film is a disappointment nin mortal kombat 1995 director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining nhowever he fails to repeat that in this film nthe combat scenes particularly the big one at the end is incredibly unimaginatve nfighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize nbut instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with it goes for the old shootem up one guy vs an army type of cinema that i thought died with the military action films of the 80s nif the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film nhowever it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that making the film a big disappointment n

 the 13th warrior comes at the end of as summer where weve already experienced man eating sharks deep blue sea man eating crocodiles lake placid and even a man hunting witch the blair witch project nnow the 13th warrior presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears nthe story if thats what you want to call it follows ahmed ibn fahdlan antonio banderas an arabian poet who falls in love with his kings wife and is banished from his home land nhe then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them neventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men nthirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission and as you guessed it ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth nhes not a warrior and at first not well accepted by the vikings but as the movie advances hell have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield nthats basically the entire plot nthere is also a romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and one assumes drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didnt just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story ninstead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer nthe film is basically non stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock nthe battle scenes although well choreographed are not involving and not the least bit exciting nwe dont get to know any of the characters and so we dont care who lives and who dies nthe film which wants to be beowolf comes across more as a failed actionadventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels nit was directed by john mctiernan whos the thomas crown affair is also playing in theaters currently nand its not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that the 13th warrior was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences nit belongs back on the shelf n
it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy made their feature film debut with blood simple a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge murder and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas nit bears some resemblance storywise to the coens recent fargo but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here blood simple is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end nthe premise of blood simple is really just a slight variation on the standard lovetrianglerevenge scheme sleazy bar owner julian marty dan hedaya hires a shifty private detective m nemmet walsh to kill his wife abby frances mcdormand and her illicit lover ray john getz nthings start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but upon collecting the money becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme nto reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much but what ensues is a series of bloody and i do mean bloody confrontations each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening nevery act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrators eyes but we the audience are made privy to the big picture and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person nthis aspect of the story along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality one gets the sense that if guns and in one case shovels were not available some of these characters would claw each other to death are the most effective components of the film nthe coens might have done well to title the film fear and loathing in texas nsome have labeled blood simple as a modernday noir but while i am not an expert on either genre it seems more like a horror movie than anything else nthe coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one relatively innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive nthat said blood simple is a very good horror movie the fear and suspense here are genuine nthe coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun discharging it as it skitters across the floor or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film nthat said blood simple is not exactly flawless nfor one thing the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover or at least thought they did but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder nand although they at least didn t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife the coens also arent quite immune to horror cliches they indulge in a prolonged deadguyseemstohavecomebacktolifebutthenwefindoutitsonlyadream scene that had me rolling my eyes nthe film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film n blood simple is not quite the masterpiece of neonoir that many seem to think it is but its a decent movie and it showcases the coens ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but nonexploitative manner ni would firmly recommend it to all coenheads as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller n

stories around the world named its all true this short dealt with welles attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage

scenes had been restored using stills i was interested to see sadie thompson where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago nthis is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story miss thompson nthis is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seenlittle awkwardness and a very clever script nthe actors gloria swanson raoul walsh who also directed and wrote the screenplay and especially lionel barrymore as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadies soul but really wants to get her between the sheets is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel nswanson adds real life to the character adding an worldly affectionate air to the bawdy sadie nunfortunately the ending is rather poorly tied up it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of liveaction film or the original script nthe happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on i cannot believe maughams short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion weve been waiting an hour and a half for nstill its entertaining right up to the end certainly barrymores incredibly hammy performance which nonetheless works perhaps due to the silent screen is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells bakkers and robertses of the religious worlds na c movie worth 2 50 if you can find it nthe pied piper czechoslovakia 1986 director jim barta screenwriter kamil piza nthis is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids nit tells the old folk tale of

starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing publicparticularly kids wanted to see ntherefore its with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas ndespite some innovation and risk taking the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes as are its characters na group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the savages that live there nthe natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust nonly the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash nthe ending as it turns out is not entirely a happy one and is one of the films finer moments nthe characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth ngovernor ratcliffe for instance is a snobbish singleminded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses ncaptain john smith is a blond hunk who while slightly misguided is good at heart npocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time nshe even comes complete with insignificant best friend nagain against tradition talking animals arent used but a lusty wizened talking tree is nthis is an odd compromise but its one of the few elements that really work nthe animals are a delight and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation nmaybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes nthe talking tree who seems to have a thing for john smith is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch nthe music a welcome delight in the later disney films is mostly a let down here with the exception of the catchy and motivational colors of the wind nmel gibson as the voice of john smith has a solid singing voice and should have been used more nthe opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character ni was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time neven the children in the audience seemed restless nwhile theres no stopping a kid from seeing something that they wantor disney wants them tomost i believe will be disappointed nperhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history nits all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movies entertainment value but doing so to historical facts doesnt work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewers minds and plot holes that are never filled neven the artwork another disney strong point varies greatly in quality making any story problems even more obvious nas mentioned above there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film nfor instance if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with savages why did he so quickly change his previous kill as many indians as i can attitude nif he was such a nice guy after all he should have changed his ways long before this nor how about pocahontas amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ni can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot history was modified in the film anyway nas it is i wonder if it doesnt give kids the wrong impression nin short the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set nwhile disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions they end up failing on too many levels n
what surprises me most about the longawaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker nthe dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ni can hear batfans everywhere protesting first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker nand indeed this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play nnicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding oscarworthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman nnicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown romero played the joker in the 60s tv series non one hand nicholsons joker is extremely funny nhis murderous escapades and manic outbursts which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film nbut on the other hand his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind nthe jokers cruelty and demented diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister nthis guy is off his rocker and he not only knows it he flaunts it nbut enough about nicholson as the joker im sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman nlike many i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader nbut batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting nkeaton delivers nhe is convincing as the tormented millionaire bruce wayne and beneath his hard black body armor he is mysterious and formidable as the batman neven though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city nvisually batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team nthe movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as the dark knight returns and the killing joke nburtons film is a feast for the eyes the 35 million budget is definitely on the screen nthe sets costumes and makeup are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations nnicholson isnt joking when he boasts wait till they get a load of me nhis grimacing smile green hair and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous nkeatons wardrobe is equally appropriate nbatmans cape mask and body armor make him look threatening frightening and invincible bringing to mind not adam wests campy costume in the tv series but peter weirs outfit in robocop nproduction designer anton fursts sets are a wonder ngotham city is dark and foreboding almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york nthe batcave is cold bare and desolate nthe world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption nthe movies gritty bladerunnerrobocop look is a joy to behold nthe plot on the other hand is not as rousing nthe screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting nit takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear nbatman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology but it fails to give us enough of either one nas i mentioned earlier the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker but it never fully establishes batmans psychological motives and underpinnings nin terms of action batman is not as thrilling as you might expect nburton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story nmore than anything batman is a mood film nwhile batman may not completely absorb and excite you it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books nthanks to its distinctive look the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world n
if youre into watching near on two hours of bored foulmouthed florida teens having sex doing drugs having sex listening to eminem having sex playing video games having sex and killing one of their peers then bully s for you nbased on jim schutzes novelization of a truelife event bully charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who in 1993 murdered their high school bully in cold calculated blood nthe film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers nin the hands of controversial director larry clark kids however it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmakers pornographic proclivities nin terms of the incident and what provoked it bully stirs up nothing new nthe high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lotbored with life not much ambition promiscuous profane nthe bully in question bobby kent nick stahl is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesnt exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department nhe hounds and harries and humiliates his best friend marty played by brad renfro and martys girlfriend lisa rachel miner doesnt care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby nsimply remove him from the equation nmarty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous profane and stoner friends plus a recruited hit man lure bobby to a swamp one night stab him beat him over the head with a baseball bat and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators presumably finish him off ntheres no remorsethe next day theyre talking about it as openly as a homework assignment nthey did it because they wanted to and because they could nwhats most troubling about the film however isnt the unsettling subject matter and the matteroffact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material nnot only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in bully but theres also an uneasy exploitative feel to it ngratuitous crotch shots abound one of which makes the zipper cutaway in theres something about mary look like the height of subtlety nclark is so preoccupied with his female predominantly leads that you forget at times what this movie is supposed to be about nthe stripping bare literally and figuratively of these actors who are after all playing underage teenagers becomes harder to watch over time as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera nthe conclusion of bully offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime nits a short sequence of stillsheather 7 years ali 40 years lisa life imprisonment for examplebut its infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it n bully aims for truth exploits it shamelessly then bludgeons it to death n
review a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders nliving with his grandfather jehan jack warden in poverty nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times they are renting a spare oneroom cottage and the greedy malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them out of the house if they dont pay the rent nnello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen in either a movie or in real life n his hero is peter paul rubens the great flemish painter of the 17th century nnot that these are the only things that make nellos life happy however nhe has a dog of flanders whom he names patrasche who is a heroic rintintin of the 19th century whom he rescues from his cruel unkind master nin addition he even has a best friend and future sweetheart in the lovely wealthy aloise whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with lowerclass nello n he thinks hes not good enough for her and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying nbut then he was a poor guy himself before he married as mentioned later on in the film none day nello encounters a mysterious yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande played wonderfully by jon voight who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist nand every christmas there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year the winner getting a lot of money neager to save his home and his aging dying grandfather nello willingly decides to become an artist asking aloise to pose for him none night the two travel to a circus where they have their fortune told one of the films most delightful scenes that great happiness is destined for them nshe gives the kids a ring whom nello places on aloises hand n afterwards the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers nunfortunately things are not all ladeedah in this tale naloises father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again nbad enough that they cant see each other although we know nello and aloise dont we but thats only the start of nellos troubles naloises farm is burned down and nello is wrongfully accused by the landord of his cottage for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise nthis decreases nellos reputation around the town save aloise and her parents and a kindly miller william who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by nmatters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies and he has to pay for his funeral nbut then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home for not paying his rental permanetly nthis means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold freezing wind nworst of all the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time the portrait of the princess fails to win the prize at the festival nnow nello and patrasche are really depressed and close to freezing to death nwill nello be able to find any happiness in his life nwill patrasche save the day nwill nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise na dog of flanders is a delightful heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages neven older ones who consider themselves too sophisticated for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grownups too nthere have been other movies of this ilk boy and dog and while this one falls into that category it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself nmove over or rather roll over old yeller this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight nthe cinematography courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful and really adds to the powerful drama of the film nit also gives a feel of being in flanders the whole film was respectably shot in flanders nthe music from richard friedman is also remarkable an evocative poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century nthe opening song over the credits is very beautiful i hope the soundtrack is available and theres a brief excerpt of cheer up charlie from willy wonka and the chocolate factory sung by aloise to nello in another delightful scene nthe cast is firstrate jesse james and jeremy james kissner who play nello are some of the most endearing adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life so are the girls who play aloise madyline sweeten as the younger and farren monet as the older nnot that they are the only good stars however njack warden is ideal as jehan eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character n the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming touching ones nalso bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william nhes another one of my favorite characters in the film nbut jon voight as i mentioned before is the perfect choice for michel nhe brings a mysterious yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he can win the contest nbut what makes this film fun to watch is how welldefined the characters are and the pace of the story best of all it has a happy ending though i will not give it away sorry is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters nfor the first time since the beginning of 1999 there comes a film which doesnt rely on popular formula stuff such as bigbudget special effects commercial rock soundtracks or any of that stuff nthis one relies on telling a fully characteroriented story with just the right amount of heart humor and drama nthat to me is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful neleanor osullivan of the home news tribune noticed this and was kind and generous enough to welcome it for want of a better word a glow surrounds a dog of flanders nits heart is in the right place and it engages you nyou can guess where the film is going because this is welltraveled territory but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner an oftentold story is well worth a revisit nin addition there were a couple of other enthusiasts such as chicagosun times and the washington post you should read their reviews theyre really positive nother critics however were not so kind nstephen holden of the new york times had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing nhe found the film to be a sea of sugary bromides and condemned mr voights character as hopelessly wooden adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda nin addition entertainment weekly slamdunked the film condemning it as the worst family film of the year nthere have been so many other bad reviews like this too nmy suggestion disregard the critics nthey just have a big problem with touching family films and one should never pay attention to them nthis dog of flanders may only be a little family movie it probably wont be a big hit in the style of titanic but then again no other film has been since then but that is not a bad thing in and of itself nthis is a story that is sure to warm your heart and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders nit is also one of the better family films around this year nnone of the other films i have seen this year though they were good have been so lowkey and touching nif youre looking for familystyle entertainment look no further than this charming boyanddog yarn ngo see it while you still can for as i mentioned it might not be a big bowwow at the box office for a long time nsee it while you can nthere is really no need to compare a multimillion dollar blockbuster such as star wars episode i the phantom menace or tarzan or even the iron giant with a tender sweet little family movie n

upon taking a seat at the theater and surveying the crowd i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises nim twentytwo but have been accused of looking sixteen nyet as the film began any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five closeknit yet troubled sisters ndirector pat oconnor inventing the abbots circle of friends weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss need and the bonds between five sisters nthe family is ruled by kate meryl streep an unconsciously strict schoolteacher who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family nthere is very little background given to the viewer as we are thrust into a tense but loving home nsquabbles take place one after the other caused by years and years of history nperhaps one of the best things about this film is its naturalness nno situation is overwrought and characters react as real people do to real problems nthis probably is a result of the film being from a stage play nthe play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright nwhat seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples both in lughnasa and africa nin fact dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness nlegs tap and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster nonly after the music stops and the characters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble nin the quiet after the music we muse that its sad that music has to cease and families falter nthe movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy the narrator of the movie as a young child flying a kite nhe trips over a bump and loses hold of his string and the kite floats off farther into the distance ndrawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained and at another glance mischievous nthe mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite and kates hold of the family isnt strong enough to hold off the winds of change nas michael stands staring at his kite fly away we hear the adult michael looking back at the season that his world changed forever nthe movie is not overpowering but it gives us a beautiful window into the life love and trouble of a household of lonely women nnote this is the first movie review ive ever written any responses on it would be greatly appreciated n n

as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell there is a wonderful eyecatching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film nthe shot has tibbs face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars nto see these bars blocking his face we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film nas a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots no matter how innocent tibbs is he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin nthe bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous nthis one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds nit perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film n in the heat of the night was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america njewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental nin these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers nhe is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present npreceding the very original a soldiers story and the recently released the hurricane in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters nthe film which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted ntibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him nas a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains tibbs is the perfect protagonist npoitier also gives an excellent noteworthy voice to his character nnever nervous and always commanding his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing nhowever unlike the hurricane where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger who won best actor for his excellent performance nas a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role nhe starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople nhe would refer to tibbs as boy and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him nas the film progresses though there is a very gradual change in the sheriff nhe begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors nwhat i really enjoyed about steigers character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film nhe still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil ninstead it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future nmost movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes nthis action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day njewisons determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate n in the heat of the night shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960s nit displays this perfectly nhowever the actual investigation although it is not the main focus of the film lacks interest nit seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim nthere were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane police officer sam being a suspect was not needed nalso it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered nthe rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic n a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson nhe managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 in the heat of the night and the even better in cold blood n
bats is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan nto pull something like this off you need to have a sense of wit and style with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines nsomething like the underground worm thriller tremors had just the perfect mixture of these elements and in return the film was tremendous fun nwith the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player bats mainly plays its premise for straightarrow horror njudging by the ridiculous premise this was not exactly a wise move nthe movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcocks the birds but fails miserably ndone right it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema nunfortunately bats is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly terribly wrong nthe only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be ni will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom bats is aimed toward nthose guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats nthese bats are not very nice because they eat a lot of people nboy are these bats ugly nthey are infected with this bogus virus that makes them superduper smart ntheyve got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all na whole bunch of people in texas get killed so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats nthey have big guns and other cool things to fight them with but the bats are pretty smart so its sorta hard to do nthe bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good nbut no bats is probably too violent for preschoolers nthe film directed by louis morneau should have ventured straight into video stores non the small screen perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations nbut sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure the film is poorly written poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude neven the bats themselves are cheesy and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed nthe sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey lou diamond phillips who embodies every pathetic stereotype a smalltown authority figure usually portrays he chomps on a cigar struts contentedly in his boots etc nthe scientist is dr sheila casper dina meyer who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as the best in her field nmeyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable but everything about dr casper is recycled beyond recognition nher memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hoopers tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in jaws neverything revolving around bats is tired drivel which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up nthe supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw with voices dubbed in later nin fact that may have worked out better in the end ntake one glance at caspers batloathing sidekick jimmy leon and youll have immediate deja vu hes the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie constructed specifically for timed comic relief nunfortunately none of his comic interludes are funny nin the role of deranged mad scientist dr mccabe the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch nmccabe accidentally released two experimental test subjects and the virus spread to other bats nthe entire town of gallup texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else nsomething like when is the damn movie going to be over ni just want my money nthe bats are ugly i must say ntheres the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing but mainly the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery nonly bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been but by the absurdly stupid climax its way too late in the game for a decent recovery ncharacters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire nlets explore the logic there is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population nyou could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one and after that there are only 18 000 more of them nthis kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind bats n
in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer professor with such livedin naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance never since wall street douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid80s nin those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world nyoud think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a goodnatured veneer but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton douglas played the role straight and out in the open nin wonder boys his performance isnt showy or a tour de force its simple yet truthful nhe embodies grady a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes ngrady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map nwhen we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms ngrady points out in his narration that they only do so out of jealousy ntheir target is the very writerly named james leer played by the always understated tobey maguire a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for nleer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions nhe speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges nhes portentous and gloomy as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers though his act is a little too calculated nhe reminds me of the selfimposed outcast film director jim jarmusch dead man ghost dog nwhenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer exclusively dressed in black and with his spiked hair dyed snow white nleer is similar a guy who equates quirks with depth ntobey maguire fits well in the role nwith his round sweeteerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude nbut unlike cort maguire is easier to warm up to hes a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility nkatie holmes plays hannah a beautiful talented writing student just itching to get in gradys pants nthis is a plot line i had trouble with ndouglas in his old age is beginning to resemble jerry springer a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions nat first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady maybe its because im jealous and wish holmes was throwing herself at me after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth then i think of douglass real life companion the breathtaking catherine zeta jones nseeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping nsuddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie and im pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas nthere is a movie in there somewhere ngrady rather chivalrously if you ask me resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell a droll frances mcdormand who is his age but also married to another professor nokay maybe not so chivalrous nthere is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says she was a junkie for the printed word nlucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice nrobert downy j r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm ndowny has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual nhes arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance nthe actor is perfectly cast here and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor ni wish wonder boys had more of him nsearching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless for it meanders through its running time but thats part of its charm nand maybe im a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia a place im greatly fond of and a place rarely explored in american cinema neveryone has a subgenre be it war films westerns dance movies that they happen to be privy to nim privy to films about literary types i e nthose individuals enthralled by the written word and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch nthe direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters rather than generic mapped out story points nsometimes the dialogue is too clever but thats a problem i wish i found with films more often nanother minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted like its characters but as the story progresses it begins to open up nfor me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types and as a lowkey comedy for its chuckleworthy throwaway gags nthe gags are like those in the great robert altman m a s h the long goodbye movies where jokes exist as asides on the fringes like jokes in life often do nthe broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog and incessant smoking of marijuana isnt ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things ncurtis hanson who before his last film la confidential toiled about with exploitation fare like losin it an early tom cruise sex comedy and the hand the rocks the cradle has graduated to more meaningful films nhe directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up nthe morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party but in a wonder boys party it fits nthe film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen nits the cinematic equivalent to a good read novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies nmany will find it slight but i found much to savor among its subtleties n
if youre going to make a twohour hollywood injoke why bother releasing it to the general public nif youre going to create a film that will appeal primarily to bigname actors and people who know woody allen then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters nwhile watching celebrity i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people nwhat he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited selfdeprecation ncelebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself living in a world that hes familiar with dealing with people like the ones he actually knows nallen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more nbranagh plays lee simon a journalistturnedscreenwriter who divorces his wife robin judy davis shacks up with some hot women famke janssen charlize theron winona ryder and goes about trying to get big stars melanie griffith leonardo dicaprio to read his script about an armored car robbery nthe usual elements of recent allen films are all here including the sexual insecurity of the main character lots of selfloathing women and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another nunless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally its not likely that youll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity naside from all the injokes the story falls far short of compelling and the characters are all empty and lifeless nbranagh proves once again that hes a superb performer nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly nthe problem is that hes the same character allen always plays a character whos getting more than a little dull to watch ni mean come on how many times have you seen this guy n he hates his work and he cant be satisfied by any one woman and at the end of the movie nothing has been solved nhe brings all of his problems upon himself crashing his car because hes receiving fellatio and other such stunts so its pretty hard to care about him nin addition isnt allen capable of creating characters who arent just like him ni know he is but he didnt do it in celebrity nthe vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances ndavis playing the same woman with low selfesteem that she played in deconstructing harry has a few touching moments but ends up the same despicable celebritytype that fills the rest of the movie nsome of the actresses are saved because of their beauty theron and ryder especially but theyre not likable people nonly famke janssen as a book editor interested in simons new novel has any life nthe men in the picture dont do much better joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin while dicaprio as a christian slaterjohnny depptype spoiled young actor is funny but disengaging nwhats really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its themes are nallen seems to think that hes making an insightful movie about the way normal people look at celebrities nthe main problem with this is that the character with whom were supposed to identify simon is not a normal guy hes just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters nthe other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us none of them register as realistic interesting characters they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue nin addition allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly robin in this scene says something like its interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ncelebrity is arguably allens biggest misfire to date nit does have a few good scenes therons superorgasmic model character is kind of funny and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two nbut celebrity is a failure at the core unless allens point was to make a selfindulgent movie about himself and his friends nif he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke then he succeeded in that ni for one dont enjoy feeling like an outsider n
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned njames tobacks return to directing after a eightyear layoff two girls and a guy is a film which is comprised more or less of just that one guy blake robert downey jr two girls carla heather graham and lou natasha gregson wagner one primary setting blakes absurdly spacious bachelor apartment and a great deal of dialogue nembracing a near realtime approach this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr toback for his bantering characters nfortunately the films cast is up to the challenge and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters while admittedly variable are occasionally wickedly amusing nthe films setup is fairly generic in nature and opens rather unpromisingly nwe meet selfpossessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou both waiting outside a soho loft nas they engage in idle chatter it is revealed that theyre both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport and it doesnt take long for them to come to the realisation that theyre being twotimed by the same guy nmore indignant with him than catty with each other the duo break into blakes loft and await his arrival for a confrontation nits when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride nplayed with magnificent bombast by mr downey jr blake is a cad all right but a captivatingly dynamic blusterous and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights nits fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat and perhaps the films best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others but by his own innate behaviour nwhether hes flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds carla lou and his unseen sickly mother its never less than wildly entertaining and insightful nthough at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a oneman show a typical afternoon in the life of blake if you will carla and then lou reveal themselves and the sparks begin to fly n one of the great touches in the film is how blake when startled by carlas unannounced appearance begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cats out of the bag ndoubleteamed by the understandably aggrieved women who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy an increasinglyflustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even selfrighteous declarations against their verbal jabs nsurprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was offlimits for this film nhowever itd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lous outrage to full featurelength and its as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel nthe dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever the films tempo loses its liveliness the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion and several sequences fall flat nsubtle and notquitesubtle allusions are made a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale none key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla ntwo girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter longrunning dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene contractuallyobligated to deliver an rrated film mr toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaleddown versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc17 rating in favour of an r and while admittedly titillating the net effect of the vignette on the films thematic narrative is rather dubious nif anything two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr downey jr whose versatility is put to the test in this film nhe plays the gamut from indignant to humbled from selfassured to disconcerted yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered nits a wonderful performance in a role customtailored for him mr toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr downey jr was arrested on drug charges and its hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character in a monologue to his mirrored reflection blakes selfchiding to get his shit together is disquieting in its resonance nwhile mr downey jr s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film both actresses are solid in more broadlyobserved roles nms graham is quickly becoming one of americas more daring actresses involving herself in three successive risky projects two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman nshes quite appealing here playing a character at once both dainty and sultry nmeanwhile ms gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying or like me endearing nshe tones it down substantially as the film progresses but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox nthe film was reportedly shot in eleven days filmed mostly in sequence and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout ntwo girls and a guy has an agile spontaneous sort of feel and one senses that mr toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors nwhile the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact it doesnt feel constricted the expansive apartment setting is wellused to vary the background and mr toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner ntwo girls and a guy falls short of its potential but thanks to some stellar work by mr downey jr its still often an enjoyable bitingly funny romp particularly as we watch the surprisinglyresilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends n im an actor he tells them at one point using the ol triedandtested occupationalhazard defense n actors lie nbut not they all seem to agree denzel washington n

 you cant have any of this nits all mine n a twisted priest charles huevelman hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana angela zimmerly looks on uninterested nan evil presence appropriately named the presence dj vivona rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him nfor kicks the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered nwhen something goes wrong and one of the presences recent victims escapes the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped nthey enlist the help of alison ramona midgett a recent suicide victim to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the netherrealm nher mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed nthe kings sorcerer amblyn who also lost his job decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice nduring the downtime in his unemployment amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery evil and torture ruled nabraham wished to follow his master into this new realm so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love nin this new realm amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm nafter each murder abraham would become stronger until his power surpassed that of amblyns nbecause of the screwup that allowed the recent escape abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself nas alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered nif theres one thing i cant stand when i see a film its when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty nfilms like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this and now ice from the sun can be added to this list nthis film is essentially an 80 minute stalkandslash film following the dantes inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and supposedly haunting images many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot nif there arent bizarre images floating past the screen then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone ncompelling but ultimately not nthe opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images nthe credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesnt pop up until near the end of the sequence nwhen the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv nat least the music in the film is pretty decent made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett nat the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing nfor some reason though he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance none overalled cretin handles the presences gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel then theres an inbred father dwight spurgin and his two inbred children mark kettler and jennifer poirrierwallace that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half doghalf human mix with a shotgun and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds nwhy would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of rednecks when you yourself had all of these cool powers nand how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ni can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment nthe most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned draggingsalting sequence nthe character in question dana angela zimmely has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated na priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken nhe picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever nwhen she starts to leave the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life walks out and makes like it wants to be crucified by her nthe presence starts to clap annoyingly which continues for the rest of the sequence until dana takes off with the strange creature following her nwhen it finally catches up to her she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ nthe box for the film claims because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 ncontains nudity and graphic violence nwhile both is certainly true there doesnt seem to be much of either in any large amounts nbesides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump a semigraphic selfsurgery scene and two instances of head trauma one run over and one melting most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety nas for nudity it is very sparse but at least we get to see angela zimmerly far and away the most attractive cast member before her body is bruised torn and bloodied by the dragging incident nice from the sun has been released on vhs by www bmovie com nit has been presented in in fullframe only and the transfer for a film shot a good deal in 8mm is pretty decent nbesides the decent soundtrack which is also available from www bmovie com a makingof video is also available called on thin ice ni havent had the opportunity to see the documentary but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed if only to see how director eric stanze director of a similar cult film called savage harvest conducted the atmosphere on set n
your friends and neighbors is a rather bizarre film about 6 people who hop in and out of bed with each other nwritten and directed by neil labute whos first film in the company of men was simply marvelous disappoints a bit here with this one nthe story involves two couples ben stiller catherine keener and aaron eckhart amy brenneman an artist assistant nastassja kinski and an egotistical women abuser jason patric nthe characters names are not apparent and are not mentioned in the entire movie neach of the characters has their own sexual style and they dont seem to merge together well nso the group experiments behind their respective partners back nthere are some hysterical scenes one involves jason patric aaron eckhart and ben stillers characters nthey are all in a sauna talking about their best lay when jason patrics character makes a surprising confession nthe whole scene is hilarious and exceptionally well written and acted nthe enjoyed this movie although it seemed a tad lengthy even though it only runs 99 min nthe films cast is exceptional with oscar caliber performances by catherine keener aaron eckhart and jason patric ni would not recommend this film to people who are offended by conversations that are very sexually explicit nit did seem to offend people more than half of the people in the theater left during the film nalthough your friends and neighbors doesnt have the power of labutes earlier film it still manages to be somewhat entertaining and funny while maintaining a melancholy philosophy on human relationships n
its difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of awardwinning tv commercials as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes nthat said hayess feature film debut lives up to expectations coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic nbut occasionally bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary nthose moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the films two stars jake gyllenhall as the immunodeficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his overprotective hyper religious reaganloving mother ngyllenhalls sweetnatured delivery of jimmys hilariously na ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy comingofage story jimmy is a bubble boy a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld nhis mom homeschools jimmy filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and antisexual messages until hes befriended by chloe marley shelton the beautiful girl next door njimmy falls in love with chloe but is afraid that his love will literally kill him as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss nbut when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinksaddled crosscountry voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love nthe offensive bits have little to do with jimmys rare handicap regardless of what the films protesters would have you believe but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi nbut even if you find stereotype humor funny its hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags nthey even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks nbut a few of the harsh jabs manage to work especially in the case of kurtz who very bluntly shows the dark hypocritical side of the religious right and a wacky sendup of a cult called bright n shiny led by the inimitable fabio nunfortunately a few giggles cant make bubble boy the riotous offthewall comedy it so desperately wants to be nhonestly its a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made and im not just saying that because its so mediocre nhow odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesnt seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many nand now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of reallife bubble boy david philip vetter maybe disneys wondering the same thing nhope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile n
if theres one thing in common about all of hollywoods major studios its that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more nalthough twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures fox searchlight and fine line respectively its obvious theres no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater nso when a movie like gary ross pleasantville comes along wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production its a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes nalthough the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted pleasantville should not be mistaken for a nothought movie nquite the opposite is true in fact as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen nthe story both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation captures the essence of statementmaking in the cinema nnot in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross work it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough nkudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture nit stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who through quite a bit of luck find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named pleasantville nmaguire as the reserved bud parker is perfect for the pseudoworld but the rebellious mary sue witherspoon is not at all made for the fatherknowsbest times nits not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end and begins to teach the townspeople in a quite unlikely way what life is really like nsoon hues of color creep into the black and white world and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism others fear the strangeness nat one end is a soda shop ownerturnedpainter named mr johnson jeff daniels and at the other end is a closeminded mayor j t nwalsh and his chamber of commerce but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town nfine performances are turned in all around nmaguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j t nwalsh in his latest and final posthumous performance ndaniels brings an atmosphere of awe inspiration and hope to his character whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness almost to the point where you can sense gene hackmans envy nfor daniels its his most commendable performance of the last three years or more and for walsh its a complementary exclamation point on a fine career nalso of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish ntheres not much to dislike about pleasantville and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who dont n
gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change of heart by the films end and becomes a believer in god instead of a skeptic going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer nnobody can save this bomb from its own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religioustype of film nits just a pile of dreck an nillconceived exploitive project a pyrotechnical film n end of days aims to be an apocalyptic thriller nit features an idiotic script a hack director and a onedimensional star who is past his prime which nmakes this film dumber than dumb plus its not funny not campy or is it in the least bit entertaining nits just dreary and unwatchable a nbigbudget slasher film narnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan occupying gabriel byrnes body and possessing a wall st bank account from destroying the world nthe film opens in vatican city roma 1979 where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso looking out at the night sky and seeing a comet whiz by who proclaims after looking at his scrolls thats the sign for the eye of god which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satans baby the antichrist in the hour before the new century begins when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth ntomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom nbut some in the popes circle want to kill her if found even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live as he lectures them even in the worlds darkest days doing evil doesnt stop evil but brings on more evil nwe saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 which seems to be the logical place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries nthe chosen woman is christine york robin nit is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wisecracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest thomas aquinas arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot nhe nevertheless can speak and tells arnold an end of days is coming as prophesized in revelations nbut satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of the end of the world on his body nit is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman nhe quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues people jumping out of windows satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnolds partner as the piss explodes like gasoline satan being fired at resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it nthere is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs including the subway churches and luxury buildings nthe only trouble with all these highbudget action sequences was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value nthe story was so terrible and inaccurate that it did not have an iota of value or credibility nmercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 nwhy is the end of 1999 considered to be the devils number 666 well n nsatans numeral is actually 999 which is upside down of 666 naccordingly you just put a 1 in front of it and bingo you get 1999 nwith logic like that this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewers eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult nthis film should become a classic used by film schools in how not to make a horror film ni highly recommend seeing it for that purpose n

a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city nthe lawyer kevin lomax keanu reeves is not offered a job yet he is asked to simply pick a jury nhe accepts nthe jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm nmaking his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money but a gorgeous apartment nhe convinces his wife mary ann charlize theron to make the move to new york nthe first case given to him is a big test a winless case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement nthe charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal nhis new boss and partner in the firm john milton al pacino is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing explaining many of his philosophies on law women and sex and angles the promise of a blissful wealthy life nkevins next case is a dream case given to him by milton himself much to the chagrin to his colleagues defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law nalthough kevins career is taking off his home life is not doing very well nmary ann is starting to have numerous problems nshe is experiencing severe depression over kevins long hours and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls their faces becoming horribly disfigured nkevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife nhe does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with then focus all of his attention on his wife nnot helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer connie nielson also working with the firm nmary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home nkevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife and gets disturbing news from his mother judith ivey about the mystery concerning the identity of his father nhe also starts to lose control of his case nkevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man nthat man is his boss mr milton a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself nkevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store nbut how do you defeat the devil nwhy is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ndo filmmakers really believe that normal courtroom drama doesnt fit the bill and they have to juice them up nthe courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom which wouldnt have been too bad if it werent keanu reeves trying to pull it off ni give reeves credit for trying hard but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short ncharlize theron defines the term overthetop in her performance as mary ann lomax a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in 2 days in the valley nthe only good performance in the movie is by al pacino but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess nmaybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil and you can tell he is having fun doing so but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him nits pretty standard stuff including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom nplease read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled but i have to get something off of my chest nin 1986 i remember watching a movie called wisdom with emilio estevez and demi moore and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do nwhat i like to call guess what it was all a dream scenario nin wisdom the two lead characters are killed at the end only to have one of the characters wake up from an apparent and say gosh im glad that didnt really happen ni considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with nwell the same thing happens in the devils advocate and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan since it failed and he is the devil but the point is that the last 90 of the film didnt happen ni know its a stretch after all it is a movie and nothing really happened but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that nof course the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one nas i recall wisdom was a decent film n the devils advocate is not nthe devils advocate ndirected by taylor hackford john milton al pacino kevin lomax keanu nreeves mary ann lomax charlize ntheron mrs lomax judith nivey eddie barzoon jeffrey jones christabella connie nnielson nwritten by randy turgeon march 18 1998 n
in the opening shot of midnight cowboy we see a closeup of a blank movie screen at a drivein nwe hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses hooves nwithout an image projected onto the screen the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our minds eye neven without having seen a cowboys and indians movie somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema nbut do cowboys really exist or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper nexploring this theme director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept nis the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend nmidnight cowboy suggests that the american dream like image of the cowboy is merely a myth nas joe buck migrates from place to place he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself only further degeneration nduring the opening credits joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads john wayne the alamo nas joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show a lady on the air describes her ideal man as gary cooper but hes dead na troubled expression comes across joes face as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone nhaving adopted the image of a cowboy since youth joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody njoes persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream nhe romanticizes about making it in the big city but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance nby the end of midnight cowboy joe buck loses everything and gains nothing njust as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success nbut how realistic are these ideals njoe had raped and been raped in texas nthe scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas nalongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation nthe ability to pack up ones belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention nschlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joes abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny nwe understand that joe adopts the fa ade of a cowboy a symbol of virility and gallantry as an attempt to neutralize his shame nhe runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york nin the scene at the diner which foreshadows joes encounter with the gay student joe buck spills ketchup on himself nstanding up we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh nschlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joes virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals signifying emasculation nbeyond the symbol of castration the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgins first sexual encounter a reference to joes first homosexual liaison nthe fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joes emasculation nit is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients but effortlessly attracts men njoe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and faggot stuff nthere are two predominant images of new york nthe first is that new york is the rich cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty nthe other new york is travis bickles new york a seedy corruptive hell on earth njoe envisions new york as the former but is presented with the latter nmirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men njoe thinks he is performing a great service for new york but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions nthe people steal joes money the landlord confiscates his luggage and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity nwhat has become of joes american dream nschlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party njoe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food drugs and sex nat the party all of joe and ratzos desires are made flesh joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami ncontrasting joes daily struggles shots of warhols crew display wanton indulgence nthere is an irreverence in the partygoers attitude we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular orgies breaking out in the periphery and drugs passed around like party favors nthe party makes a mockery of joe s ideals njoe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joes toils nthe american dream schlesinger suggests is merely a proletarian fantasy for those who are content no longer dream but become indolent nas joe heads to miami all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him nhis masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished nfor joe nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately he surrenders the identity ntossing his boots into the garbage he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami nthe final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus more introspective taking only a few glances outside the window ninstead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe nreflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus window with joe hardly taking notice nthe scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before nthe world seems smaller to joe now the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream nno longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means nmidnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream nthere is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family nthen there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock with perseverance can make a fortune in the big city njoes attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york nduring his search for an intangible paradise joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man nan allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream joe bucks progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons n
deserves recognition for making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20 ncapsule review this is what feelgood family entertainment has morphed into in the 90s an hourandahalf commercial disguised as an unnecessary remake in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass n between this rocketman and george of the jungle disney has recently eclipsed longtime champion troma as the studio most likely to include a fart joke in a film nas the absentminded professor who invents the titular computergenerated goop a listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly nthe only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newlyfounded but firm belief that writerproducer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments hes used for comedic effect in films like this and the odious home alone series ntake your kids to see boogie nights instead n
the computeranimated comedy shrek is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups nfor children it offers imaginative visuals appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces loads of action and a barrage of big laughs including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances apparently a requisite in contemporary family films nfor adults its a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids nall in all shrek is a snappy ride although there are a couple of points i found disturbing nbut first the basics nbased very loosely on a 1990 childrens story shrek follows several momentous days in the life of the title character a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using nshrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp until a local nobleman disturbs his peace npetty tyrant lord farquaad take away the awk in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite oneliners owns the land on which shrek resides nhe proceeds to turn the ogres yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle nas a result shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice pinocchio the big bad wolf the seven dwarfs and the three bears to name but a few nan enraged shrek storms to the castle only to find farquaad john lithgow ready to bargain nlord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from snow white has shown him the way nall he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife nthe mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of the dating game when snow white is shown the cheeky announcer purrs even though she lives with seven men shes not easy nfarquaad selects the lovely princess fiona cameron diaz and offers shrek a deal if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragonprotected lava moatfilled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds nshrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest accompanied by a motormouthed donkey eddie murphy determined to make the green grump his best friend nthey finally hook up with the princess only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet nfor the matter the dragon offers a few surprises as well nthe movie references a great many other flicks from babe thatll do donkey nthatll do to the graduate nbut the lions share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney nthe publicdomain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits pinocchio is referred to as a possessed toy and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin he bellows get that dead broad off the table n but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaads royal domicile which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like its a small world nwhich brings me to disturbing point number one ni laughed at all the disney swipes but found the mentality behind them a bit sad nthe acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known nfor years the two companies have tried to sabotage each others film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day nand now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer nheres a suggestion for the two boys grow up nput the past behind you ntheres room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads cant play nice then go to your rooms nthe other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad nbeyond all the irreverence shrek actually has a message people should learn to look beyond physical appearances because true beauty lies within nits a lovely notion but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaads diminutive stature ndo we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable nthe pompous selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers nadding short jokes is simply mean nstill shrek is a rollicking good time nthe computer animation is mostly impressive although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky the voice work is strong particularly from eddie murphy the laughs come fast and furious and the moral tainted though it may be is a good one nto trot out a clich shrek is fun for all ages nparents though should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short tall skinny fat etc is a bad thing n
the formula is simple ntrap a varied group of people on an isolated location then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one nthese have been the successful ingredients for many good films the thing alien aliens and tremors to name a few nso why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad n see the relic for a particularly putrid example nperhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient effort and ideas ndeep rising meets these two requirements part way but not enough to salvage the film ntreat williams is finnegan the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services and their boat for any activity no nquestions asked nthis time however they may have gone too far ntheir passengers led by the ominous wes studi are the type of multinational terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films nand their cargo lets njust say it has very high explosive potential nwhat is the target of these thieves nwhy the argonauticus of course a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage nbut something else is hunting the argonauticus something nancient and deadly nby the time the thieves arrive nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed nand now the creature senses fresh meat nso you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew joining forces with the surviving passengers including the ship owner canton anthony heald and a thief with less lofty goals trillian famke janssen against the terror from the deep nand the monster gets to pick them off one by one nfortunately for the creature this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer nwhy else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food nif theres a more clarion call for unity i dont know what it might be nits pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when nthere are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end nfor the most part the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audiences impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first n although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsous life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad ntreat williams is a passable hero and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation nbut while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way nthe biggest treat in the film however has to be pantucci kevin j oconnors whining engineboy under finnegans employ nhis constant quips may be a bit overwritten but they manage to capture the same vein of nerveaddled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens or todd graff as hippie in the abyss for that matter nits just a stock part the comicrelief character but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable nas far as the monster goes although the cgi is done well the creature has no logical consistency nthink back to the great or even just good movie monsters nthey all had a set of rules about what they could do and how and why they would do it npart of the joy of those films was slowly discovering along with the heroes just what those rules are nthe tentacle monster in deep rising doesnt have a set of rules nor if it does not a very good one nit merely eats or drinks as the case may be and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so nthe film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place nit simply happens nthe action scenes are decent but few are noteworthy nthe film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic ndeep risings peril in the water scenes pale next to camerons but can you really blame them nunfortunately deep risings efforts are more on par with speed 2 non the plus side however the films closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting but unlikely sequel nperhaps youd be better off waiting for that one n
the premise is simple if not bizarre na mad scientist trace beaulieu as dr clayton forrester launches an averagejoe michael j nelson as mike nelson into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made nwhy nits torturous its maniacal and its just plain fun nbased on the cultfavorite cable television series mystery science theater 3000 the movie isnt torturous but as for being maniacal and just plain fun it foots the bill quite nicely nmike nelson on a dogbone shaped spacecraft spends his days as any young man would dream indulging in sarcasm and horseplay and seeing quite a few movies nthe catch is these movies arent the movies he chooses but retched examples of filmmaking chosen specifically by dr forrester in an attempt to break mikes will to live ndr forrester is convinced that one too many b movies is all it will take to ruin a man but with a couple of wisecracking puppet buddies tom servo voiced by kevin murphy and crow t robot voiced by beaulieu the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema nthe purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known even if by very few of us to man nwe watch as the silhouettes of mike tom and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them nin this case its the 1954 scifi film this island earth nwe basically watch as our three leads watch only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary nthe plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant but for the sake of those who might want to know ill explain this one nthis island earth is the tale of two scientists a man and a woman who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth ntogether the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet nto make mst3k work the filmwithinthefilm naturally has to be as horrible as possible and although the tvseries introduced us to several worse films than this island earth its a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty nmst3k which doesnt actually contain the complete this island earth is a short 73 minutes but this is a step very wisely taken nas funny as some of their observations are it can only go so long noccasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously nalthough it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment its better than overkilling the whole concept post haste nmst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly but if you dont know what youre in for it could be a jarring disappointment nalthough i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars it is a movie to be seen on home video late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway and with a large saracastic crowd new years at midnight for example which is when i saw it nwarning although mst3k has more to its end credits than most the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun they are actually more annoying than most nthe name slandering and asinine oneliners were extremely unfunny and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight it put a heavy damper on the overall experience nmost people will likely stay to see what the smartalecs have to say but for me it almost ruined an otherwise good film n
keep cool a chinese film directed by semiaccomplished filmmaker yimou zhang was one of the kickoff films for this years hawaii international film festival non the day it premiered lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater nthey need not have wasted their time nthe movie is billed as a comedy but is surprisingly bereft of humor nthere are noticeable attempts at laughs but very few tries actually click ni wondered if there were jokes that i wasnt getting because im not from china but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldnt be attributed to the cultural barrier either nkeep cool just isnt very funny nthe prelude to the film was a visit by keep cools producer who with the help of an interpreter regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii nalthough the print made it the assistants luggage was lost ntoo bad that story wasnt in the movie because it got a big laugh nqu ying the films female lead was also on hand to give a few comments nhowever whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed ms ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one fastpaced incredibly long tirade nit was dizzying good foreshadowing for the film nyou see keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes nat least thats the way it seems since the camera is constantly moving ncinema verite is one thing but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another nalthough some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing i found it thoroughly distracting and after a while quite annoying nheadache as i said nthe film is about a young bookseller wen jiang who is after a young woman qu ying nthey used to be romantically involved but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship nthe first half of the film is about the young mans plan to win her back nof course the thing is she doesnt want to be won back and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit nin the fight the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost nwe later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced nthere is a funny scene the only one in the film where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner baotian li in order to recoup his losses nthere is no sense to be made out of the young womans behavior cold one minute caring the next so we feel no sympathy for her character nthe bookseller would be better off without her nalthough the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owners hand as revenge for the beating he took it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man nwhile the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation nhis quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time na friendship develops between the two men but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate nalthough only an hour and a half in length keep cool contains extraneous material nthe whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out since we dont see her from the midpoint on na case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner and would have saved us from the booksellers boring pursuit during the first half nbut of course this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour nthere are a few things that keep cool does right nas mentioned before the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good nalthough it grows tiresome the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic and represents the differences in thinking between generations nin one scene for example the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted and that it means something entirely different nalso effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner nthe nightclub owner is counting out money slapping each bundle of currency on the table nwith every shot of his hand we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge nunfortunately these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the films shortcomings and werent enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater n
i had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling twister ntwister was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize with nbut twister had amazing effects and i was hoping so would volcano nvolcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo nhe worrys about a small earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with a baby sitter nthere is one small quake then another quake nthen a geologist points out to tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons of water in 12 hours na few hours later large amount of ash start to fall nthen it nstarts nthe volcanic eruption ni liked this movie but nit was not as great as i hoped ni was still good none the less nit had excellent special effects nthe best view the nhelecopters flying over the streets of volcanos nalso there were interesting side stories that made the plot more interesting nso it was good n
capsule one of the ten worst movies ever made nchristopher lambert vs evil ninjas in modernday japan nand nobody wins nthe hunted is such a bad movie so completely inept and so totally braindamaged that i could almost feel affection for it ni could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it if it werent also insanely xenophobic and insulting nchristopher lambert plays a computerparts salesman whos on business in japan nhe meets a slinky young woman joan chen and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader john lone napparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered nsince lambert is a witness hes of course the next one to die nlets stop and think about this for a second nif lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society hed have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock nin this movie the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him ni imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body nyou know what a goof field is that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is nthis is of course only the beginning of the movies problems nlambert eventually finds pseudosafety with a longhaired modernday samurai yoshio harada and his partner yoko shimada who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun nthey are the two best things in the movie in every scene they have authority and presence and they actually look like they belong here even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows nthe script doesnt know what the hell to do with them nlone as the bad guy is zerodimensional nthe only badguy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him nin the hunted this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype nwhats funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes theres a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver and a girl in a pachinko parlor but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful nalso the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack get the cd that manages to survive despite the drek its been designed to accompany nthere is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing a gory excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment and then smothers it by trying to clumsily recouple the whole thing with the movies relentlessly stupid plot nby the time we get to the final showdown with lambert getting to wield his own sword which judging from the hamhanded editing of one scene was forged in seven hours or so we no longer care nwere not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies nsomeone once said that the key to good art good movies good books whatever is to start somewhere interesting end up somewhere interesting and show respect for the audience all along the way nthis movie bungles two out of three badly n
oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with nin a perfect world a civil action would be a breath of fresh air nits cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isnt nits romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham bookfilm isnt nand the capper it has no distinct ending and the law in hollywood films is that above all else you must have an ending neven if its based on a true story a true story which hasnt yet ended you must supply an ending a false one but an ending nevertheless nhell a civil action is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together and that includes the firm the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic nyet its also oddly and slightly unsatisfying nweird nthis is in fact a steve zallian film not just the work of a hack and zallian is the director of the muchadmired search for bobby fischer didnt see it and writer of none other than schindlers list nin short i like this guy and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories nafter all apart from the obvious itsaholocaustfilm and itsaspielbergfilm isnt schindlers list just a damn brilliant film not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study n a civil action is the same way its narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study nand its here that the film seems to go a bit wrong nthe main complaint of this film is that while yes its an engrossing lawyerly tale it has no real ending and thats not necessarily the problem with the film nits that its just kind of unsatisfying nif this were a great film it would feel complete and still end basically the same way nbut this film just seems to end and i dont want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on imagine if you will being one of those the film is about looking forward to this film and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter just so the many wont bitch about what is essentially genuine nbut the fact that it just ends is not in all actuality what is wrong with it nits rather that zallian has chosen in the last half hour to adandon the traditional lawyer story and chose the other part of his story the one about the lawyer one jan schlictman john travolta whos shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer brilliant because hes manipulative and he always wins nit wishes to make it all about jan in the end but the truth is his change although nicely done is not full nwe see him suffering from a personal crisis and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart but in the end we dont fully believe it nand i think that the problem is when he has made his decision the film choses an odd angle to go at a noble one but one that gives the films conclusion that of incompleteness nin the opening of the film we see him doing his old schtick manipulating courts winning cases effortlessly and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases nin short hes full of bullshit and we know it nin the film he takes a case that is hardly desired a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river npoint one its not of the usual criteria jan points out wickedly that dead or wounded children arent nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success npoint two it has been through several lawyers nafter turning them down jan changes his mind a muddled scene he stops his car on a bridge looks out is he feeling a sense of overachievement and he and his team of lawyers tony shalhoub zeljko ivanek and accountant william h macy head out to the town to do battle with the towns company nthey spend millions of dollars examining the land test the water what have you this is where stephen fry a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in wilde pops up thanklessly and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children and then unsuccessfully the workers at the plant nthey also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company the eccentric jerome facher played by robert duvall more on him later on nas we progress we get so involved in the way the story is being told which is engulfing everything around it including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland who lost her child who begins to have a personal crisis nthings begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half as they are up against impossible odds the judge john lithgow is not only a strickler but a pal of facher the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify no concrete evidence is being found depsite the money spent to find it and they are quickly running out of money nas macy mortgages everything he can including their homes and their office he slowly loses his sanity his meatiest role since oh fargo and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist nin fact the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par owen gleiberman especially criticized the film for not being overlydramatic i nsuppose like a grisham novel nthis wouldnt be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good hes seen as being still full of bullshit nbecause he doesnt take stock in the cares of his partners and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out nthe final half tries to redeem this as must have been the point of making this in zallians mind but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when hes seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him and thusly receiving two speeding tickets we still feel that the big change in his life is that hes not rich and esteemed anymore the films final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow nthe fault is not that there is no closure to the court case its still going on you know but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has nwe need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life nit only feels like half of that nmaybe even less nand its not travolta who does a great job here though never to be a truly memorable performance of his but rather zallian whose final chapter needs a rewrite nup to then though its an engrossing drama one of the best of the year in fact and one of the best lawyer films period nthe reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted but rather its about the lawyers the knights who battle eachother nwe learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town but the reason it cant be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find nand duvalls facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that its almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is nfacher is seen as an elderly man a goofy eccentric carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it eating lunches out of paper bags and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio and scold anyone who interupts him nbut look deeper and you see a master at work his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him and its difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way nthats why i liked this film its hard to put a pointer on nyou can never see exactly where this film will land and even when the credits roll you still arent sure what to make of it ncall it the zallian effect nsame thing happened with schindlers list not that im comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman neach film is so greatly crafted that you cant help but get involved in its broad storytelling interesting characters and most peculiarly the wit that comes along with it nif only it felt totally complete like say schindlers list though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two it might have been one of the best films of the year and along with that a full breath of fresh air n
by starring in amy heckerlings clueless two summers ago alicia silverstone proved she wasnt just another pretty pouty ingenue showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of the crush out of the water nher only work since that 1995 gem has been in junes batman robin where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl nnow shes the star and producer of excess baggage a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an illcomposed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level nsilverstones emily t hope is stuck with a billionaire father jack thompson who neglects her emotionally nin an outlandish plan to gain his affection she fakes her own kidnapping emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw nbut before the police can rescue her professional auto thief vincent roche benicio del toro jimmies the locks hotwires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily whos still trapped in the back nwhen vincent discovers emily the two dont exactly hit it off she annoys him he annoys her and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner harry connick jr he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there nalong the way of course they get into a whole heap of trouble and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky felonystudded situation nit doesnt help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops crooks and even her shady uncle ray christopher walken whos wise to his nieces ploys for attention and has mafia connections nfor at least a halfhour excess baggage bounces along fast and efficiently nduring this time emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice rolereversal twist shes an awfully aggressive combative victim and hes quite the aloof seemingly vulnerable captor nbut once its past its setup the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once na road movie a teen comedy a mob thriller a drama about family relationships you name the cliche and excess baggage likely covers its territory nof course a romance develops between the two leads but it all seems forced and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome n do you like my tummy nemily coos to vincent at one point in the film nhuh ndid i miss something nthe hardedged foulmouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with a pair of batting googoo eyes nthen again excess baggage becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not a complete surprise na supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles but the movie isnt game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded nmotivations keep shifting resulting in an often confusing narrative nscant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions n excess baggage has too many characters too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and a remaining shaky hand ni loved silverstones turn in clueless as an aloof pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austens emma nlooking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there its simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for excess baggage nsadly however excess baggage is no clueless nbut on the other hand it is clueless n

in brief best bleak comedy film since heathers nfull of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture ngo see it nso i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on hard copy with pam smart the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980s n hard copy s diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidmans fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for nsmart replied that she thought kidmans character came off as a dumb vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal n smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband nsmarts got a point nit wouldnt be the first time that the public took the better scripted and wellacted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version nhowever given a choice between the mass media happening of the real event and the fictionalized movie i would definitely opt for the later nreal murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart while pretty and alluring is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman nto die for begins in a town called little hope new hampshire the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb nthe story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being on tv nof course one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry played by matt dillon nbut with a little imagination some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement our heroine manages to overcome the naysayers in her life at least temporarily nkidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne ni have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture nher portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates nkidman knows a starmaking role when she sees it and she plays the consciencedeprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven postfeminist ubertemptress from hell nshe is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way nat one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sisterinlaw n you know she knowingly exclaims gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head nher husband beams at suzannes profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters nthis is very close to pop culture bashing heaven folks nthe other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix nhe plays jimmy a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzannes sexual favors nkidmans character vapid though she is is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland nphoenix looks like the very embodiment of genx slackerhood as envisioned by tabloid tv of course nhis jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he aint going anywhere ever nphoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne someone who actually noticed him ngus van sant drugstore cowboy my own private idaho direction is firstrate nhe keeps the pacing in this notquitethriller snapping along nvan sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesnt stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions nvan sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to get it without stopping to explain what is funny about this allamerican story nthe screenplay by buck henry is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines ive heard since heathers nhenrys story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters nhenry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny miniclassic ndanny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands neither film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trickortreat parties nallinall a

i saw this film on christmas day expecting an upbeat comedy nboy was i in for a christmas dissapointment nafter an hour of the movie i was ready to change roomsinto another theater nread on to see what i have to say nfour rooms nstarring tim roth jennifer beals antonio banderas quentin tarantino valeria golino madonna bruce willis marisa tomei alicia witt lili taylor and ione skye npossible stars n four rooms was supposed to be one of the biggest hits of the year nkey word here supposed nfour of the biggest directors in hollywood quentin tarantino robert rodriguez alexander rockwell and alison anders were all directing one big film with a big and popular cast ni guess it was all just too much because this turned out to be the biggest flop of the year and it could of been great nthe plot its new years eve and its a bellboys first day on the job nhe encounters many mysterious and kinky hotel guests as he tries to handle all his own problems ntarantino told his directors this plot and each of them wrote a script nit turned out each of them had written a dark comedy nanders wrote and directed the tale about a coven of witches madonna valeria golino alicia witt and ione skye which was the worst one out of all of them nthe second room jennifer beals was better but lacking in plot nthis room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping with his wife nthe third room antonio banderas was the best roomm about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel suite nthe final one tarantino willis was about a movie star wanting the bellboy to chop off someones finger nthe movie was just plain trash nthere was nothing here that even makes up a quality film nit was not funny and i didnt hear one laugh in the theater throughout the whole film ntim roth is horrible as the bumbling and mumbling bellboy and he ruins every joke in the film nthe supporting cast loses meaning to the word support and the only mentionable actorsactresses are antonio banderas and jennifer beals nmarisa tomei appears in a stupid cameo role nthis movie is the worst film of the year and the film could have been great perhaps like a more upbeat plaza suite but it wasnt nas trashy as it was some people will call it classic ndo you call a man chopping off a finger with madonnas chest showing a classic film nlook for more of kens kritic korner coming soon nplease check the newsgroups under the movie reviews section for updated reviews np s four rooms made number 1 on my top ten worst list of 1995 n
in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies payback was better than conspiracy theory but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon nin other words its a decent couple of hours of entertainment but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibsons greatest hits payback probably wont be on it ngibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll nmels partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt nso he puts a couple of bullets in mel leaving him for dead and goes on to pay off his creditors nbut mel isnt dead it would be a real short movie if he was and he certainly isnt happy nto make matters worse he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat nhis ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters so mel goes after the mob to get it back npayback is often a very violent film nto its credit there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic but the director im not sure which one more about that in a second made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films nthe film appears a bit disjointed in places which is understandable considering producer star gibson wasnt thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it reshot nwhen the director refused another one was brought in to do the reshoot nso as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end nits always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain unless that person has some redeeming qualities nin this case gibsons character has few redeeming qualities nbut hey its mel so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him nmy guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role the audience would not be quite as responsive ngibson is gibson whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer he does a good job nhe almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance nthis time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast including maria bello as his love interest william devane and kris kristofferson as mod bosses nthe man who steals the show and unfortunately doesnt have a real big part is james coburn as yet another mobster nif i had one big disappointment in this film it would be that coburn didnt have a bigger role nin the end payback is a fairly solid action thriller just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibsons other work n
wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day provided of course that youre the victim of a frontal lobotomy nthere is in fact no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at moviegoers in their late teens and early twenties the most lucrative target group nthis is film noir for the mtv generation fastpaced slick flashy gleefully mindless and hollow to the core nwild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 nive seen more convincing drama with nearly as much bare flesh on that pinnacle of narrative quality baywatch nwild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking its a thriller with a real story nwhat it is however is a series of increasingly improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists neverything in between those serpentine moments is filler a flash of a breast a spatter of blood and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie nthe film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen and that will probably be it nusing this approach i was right three times and wrong only once nthats not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about whats around the next corner nthe ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie the hot young cast and the old standby sex nboth have an abundance of screen time although ill admit that the films erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected nnothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu nthe softcore sex sequences are generic and dont generate much heat nthe lesbian kisses cant hold a candle to those in bound ntheresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances neve campbell possessing an ironclad no nudity clause in her contract keeps her clothes more or less on nthe films greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower nmaybe a few girls will skip seeing a fullyclothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick mrs nkevin bacon is familiar with nthe director of wild things is john mcnaughton whose last effort was the finelytuned psychological thriller normal life nthat movie featured copious sex a pair of real characters and a powerful script nits difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker nbut i suppose we all need to put food on the table nmcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success his previous widerelease picture mad dog and glory was a boxoffice disappointment nquick cuts and pretty sunrises cant even begin to cover up this movies flaws nthe main character and i use that term lightly since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality is sam lombardo matt dillon a guidance counselor at floridas blue bay high school na student the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan denise richards has a crush on him none afternoon she comes to his house to wash his car and when she leaves her clothing is torn nafter confessing to her mother theresa russell that she was raped she goes to the police station where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubinvega nthey are skeptical about here claims until another girl suzie toller neve campbell comes forward with a similar tale nmeanwhile sam convinced that hes being set up goes to a shyster lawyer bill murray for help nthe acting in wild things isnt very good but none of the principals have much to work with nthis is definitely not a character based motion picture nnot only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a tripledigit i q but it doesnt bother to give any of the onscreen individuals even a hint of depth nthe men and women populating the picture are there to look nice but nothing more nmatt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps nneve campbell gets to model the slutty look ndenise richards strikes a fetching pose in a seethrough onepiece bathing suit nand nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon nthe only one whos even remotely interesting is bill murray and he seems to think hes in comedy not a thriller maybe hes got the right idea ncolumbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the films ending which prompts the question which ending do they want kept secret nwild things has no less than three one occurs during the end credits so stay seated all of which are jawdroppingly absurd a feat that joe eszterhas the writer of basic instinct and showgirls would be impressed by nthanks to jeffrey kimballs polished kinetic cinematography wild things always looks great and george s clintons score keeps it pulsing and throbbing nbut no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is this is still trash and like all garbage it stinks n
george little jonathan lipnicki wants a little brother nafter mr and mrs little hugh laurie and geena davis visit the orphange they decide to adopt stuart a talking mouse voiced by michael j fox ngeorge isnt so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house and neither is snowbell the family cat voiced by nathan lane ngeorge and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race but snowbell wants stuart out of the house hes unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying its ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat nstuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery cgi nthe character of stuart while obviously a computer generated image grows on you as the film progresses and youll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect nthere is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film as many of the supporting cast are actual cats with computer animated mouths so they can speak nits fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with nstuart little is a charming family film nthere are some great laughs in the movie with a script cowritten by the sixth senses m night shyamalan no less nsome moments that can only be described as too cute the boat race sequence is what won me over and even the majority of the oneliners common nowadays in childrens films or films featuring nathan lane are tolerable nkids and parents will love this one nstuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video nthere are two different dvds on sale one contains the film in full frame and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 66 1 nboth versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital 5 1 audio nboth versions also contain the following extras and hang in there with me here theres a lot of them a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors an isolated score track an interactive trivia game an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo and a stuart little readalong story which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you nthere are also three music videos and six theatrical trailers called thecatrical trailers nget it nits funny for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases the adventures of elmo in grouchland madeline the nuttiest nutcracker muppets from space and baby geniuses the only bad thing about this entire dvd ni did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses ndvdrom features are also on the disc including web links and a demo of the stuart little cdrom game nbut wait ntheres still more ntheres a section called basement treasures where you will find the auditions of the films animators six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director a visual effects gag reel a production gag reel and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene with commentary from the director nthe first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson nthey give insightful and detailed thoughts about the films production nminkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski who wrote the people vs larry flynt and ed wood and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel who wrote splash and multiplicity among others nanderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur nthe second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film nmovie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track serious animation buffs will love the second one nnow i know this is slightly off topic but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now none of the music videos on the disc is for a song called i need to know by a group called r angels nthis video features four midteenage girls the singers obviously having a slumber party nthe girls ask a ouija board i need to know nwho to do who to do who to do as the song begins nthey then sneak out of their house and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits nthen they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like ill be your pleasure all the time njust say the words that youll be mine num nwhat the hell nwhat does this have to do with stuart little nhow is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd nwhen the video concludes the words to be continued appear noh i cant wait to see who theyve slept with when the toy story 2 dvd comes out nkids wont care about most of the special features on this dvd but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a kid at heart thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them nthis is the way to do dvd a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost nthe diney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar n
there have been bad films in recent years mr nmagoo was by far the worst ever made the spectacularly bad blue in the face the horrible baby genuises and now i woke up early the day i died nit may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie nthe films acting if thats what you want to call it is well mediocre to me nloaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit boy was i wrong nafter escaping from a mental institution the thief played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty nhe turns to burglary to survive robs a loan back kills the loan officer and runs with thousands na countrywide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down nhe ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere nnow he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying na film which was based on a longlost script by ed wood i have only one question no dialogue only music and movement where exactly is the point nthe film moves along at a rather slow pace but does have one advantage the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some nit opens with a fun innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that nsome of the low points are when the thief steals a womans purse and then she faints sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom the thief kills to the music of psycho ncome on people get some new ideas already nwhats even worse is that the film has no plot at all nwell to a certain extent it does but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives were bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen ni woke up early the day i died is a perfectly bad film nit shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie neven with the huge cast talent the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours n
 id rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher nwith that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story nhe will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation nfrom elmer gantry on we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church nwell think again for the apostle which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister and by implication all the rest of organized religion ninstead it gives us a highly devout man who certainly has his foibles but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god nand arguably just as surprising the goodspirited film is no comedy even if it does have humorous moments ninstead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures nwhen in the privacy of his attic robert duvall as texas preacher euliss sonny dewey argues sternly with his lord the scene shares a kinship with emily watsons character crying out for her god in breaking the wavess most powerful scene nthe body of the story starts with sonnys coming upon an horrific auto accident which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters nwith his well worn bible in hand sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accidents dying victims nthe scowling police officer orders him to go away and after he has tried to work his miracles sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lords work nrobert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the films director writer executive producer and chief financier nrarely has a movie been such a labor of love nwith a white suit peachcolored shirt and tie and dark sunglasses sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher nduvall has every movement down pat neven when he is walking down the street the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy nhe dances and claps all the way nsonnys churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deepvoiced black orators but his rhetoric is always competitive n i may be on the devils hitlist but im on gods mailing list he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent nand they lap it up npeople jump up scream praise the lord nand mean it nthe intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable nbut sonny is no saint nit turns out that he has a wandering eye which angers his wife jessie played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett njessie gets her revenge by taking up with the churchs youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonnys church leaving him unemployed nsonny letting his temper get the best of him does something foolish which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever nthe bulk of the film occurs in a small predominately black church in louisiana which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church one way road to heaven holiness temple with an enthusiastic flock nin this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e f the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church nhe asks his members to tithe but he gives all of his money nand his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks na man who cant stand to be still he tells one of his friends i quit school because i didnt like recess nin his new town he meets toosie miranda richardson who like him has a family that she hasnt seen in a while nhis romance with the separated woman like the rest of the film doesnt follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies nbilly bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker nhis confrontation with the apostle is yet another of shows many surprising scenes again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take nalthough it probably couldnt have ended any other way the movie does wrap things up nicely nand dont miss the sweet epilogue during the films closing credits na tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film nthe apostle runs a little too long at 2 12 nit is rated pg13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up n
writerdirector lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s nyes thats right he cowrote raiders of the lost ark 910 the empire strikes back 8 510 and return of the jedi 810 nnow with this film it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing nand guess what nhe succeeds once again nplot a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an openarmed swarm of people with problems nit isnt long before he befriends the smalltown billionaire folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients ncritique this film is not a comedy nit is a drama ni say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer you would think that this film secures its base in humor but unfortunately for us it does not nit is a serious film seriously flawed if you ask me but i digress which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake but overall just sits there nnow on to my review nthis movie sucks because it was slow and boring starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst and certified it all with many a predictable ending ni have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture but whatever it was he nmissed nanyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puffpiece which on a good day might be described as predictably digestible nits no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy nit sucks as a drama and bored my movie cohort right to sleep nive given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks nfirst of all i couldnt help but think about how much the lead actor loren dean looked like a young charles grodin nhe even acted like him save for the dry sardonic wit nthis kept me interested in watching him at least nnumber two and this one is really shallow seemed to be geared that way as well there were quite a few titshots as they would say back in high school nand god help me if i cant get enough of those in an aimless drama nand three and this one surprised me the most actor ted dansons cameo yes he will always be sam malone to us real fans was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person na different asshole but a different person nonetheless nif ever you rent this movie one day promise you wont throw away your hardearned money at the theaters nwait for his scene because its actually pretty good nother than that drab drab drab and drab neven jason lee a personal favorite of mine was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while nwell at least he finally came out and did some real skateboarding in this movie noh yeah and i guess thats the fourth point in my rating nanyway if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist this nfilms your bag notherwise skip it and see analyze this 810 again now ntheres a great shrink movie nlittle known facts about this film and its stars threes company fans alert nterri from the tv show also known as actress priscilla barnes plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film nthe scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage so stay tuned kids nalso it is to note that the actress was once named penthouse pet of the month in march of 1976 nshe was known as one joann witty back then nshes originally from jersey nwho the hell is loren dean the dude who plays mumford in this film nyou got me but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name njason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971 nhe was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats 610 and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp hes been in every kevin smith film except for clerks 8 510 nlisten closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince make a reference to the lost ark which is obviously an injoke considering that it is the writerdirector of this film lawrence kasdan who cowrote raiders of the lost ark 910 nkasdan also played the part of dr green in 1997s as good as it gets 810 nted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdans 1981 directorial debut body heat starring a sexy kathleen turner and william hurt n
logical time travel movies are a nearimpossibility nconsidering that the skeptics best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task noccasionally we get a film that does manage it nterry gilliams 12 monkeys was one such film nbut more frequently we get films that dont much deal with it at all nthere is one question to ask in this case does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies nthe terminator films made up for them with exciting action back to the future did it with an entertaining story and the new film frequency pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own nis frequency filled with plot holes nyes ndoes it matter nnot really nthe film opens in october of 1969 nfirefighter frank sullivan dennis quaid puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job then goes home to his loving wife julia elizabeth mitchell and son johnny daniel henson nthe doublepronged story flashes forward to 1999 where johnny now jim caviezel is all grown up and working as a police detective na strange occurrence the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in 69 and that john has found in the present day nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive john is initially overjoyed until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women nfrank and john now must work together to set things right with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past nthe premise of frequency is unusual and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions nthis isnt explained you just have to go with it nwhen frank doesnt die in a fire john is the only one who remembers it differently while everyone else remembers it the new way nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities 1969 and 1999 are to each other nsometimes franks changing the past results in something happening right away in johns world and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time nnow the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted but nevertheless logical if i thought about it hard enough for example the reason john gets advance information of the serial killers murders was because the change had already happened in franks world and john is only witnessing the projection of that change but explanations arent really the point nwhen frequency gets cooking its a riveting little thriller even if it is confusing nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment and frequency works as long as it keeps moving nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure frequency as good hollywood entertainment establishing decent likable characters making us care for them and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved ni liked many of the creative touches the split screens allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward nit actually uses the 1969 metsorioles world series the one that featured the amazin mets to great effect frank uses johns advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him n admittedly this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself ni even liked the final scene which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious but it does make sense if you think about it and give the script a lot of leeway and lets face it its a darn cool way to end the film nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in frequency to keep you on your toes and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant nthe other major thing to appreciate about frequency is the handling of the fatherson relationship nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily its a rocksolid job from both actors nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative or with a future descendant nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film if we dont believe in the characters we dont care about the outcome of the thriller plot nhere we do care because we like the lead actors ni also liked some of the supporting cast members nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles playing julia the doting wife and mother but still performs admirably nandre braugher late of the television show homicide life on the street gives a nice supporting turn as franks best friend and future colleague of john nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while franks world series predictions come true before his very eyes nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here simultaneously dismayed and amused nperhaps the only thing i didnt like about frequency is the overly sentimental coda during which the cameras focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard nbut thats only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics ni freely acknowledge that frequency may best work as a guy movie since it focuses on the very maleoriented idea of fatherson relationships echoes of field of dreams can be easily heard but the underlying concept is universally applicable nwho wouldnt want to speak with a longdead parent nor see how their children turn out n tell me about your life son excuse me while i mist up nand dont call me a sissy n

being that it is a foreign language film with no known names with a select number theaters showing it shall we dance wont be seen by that many people nand thats a shame this is a funny enchanting and goofy movie full of laughs surprises and wonderful dance sequences nthe surprising thing about shall we dance is the universal appeal of the story na us version is in the works and its no wonder its not really all that culture specific nalthough there is a narrated setup that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer isnt at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film nthe only important unexplained japanesespecific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that 1000 yen is roughly 10 when you see the film and you should see this film youll know why na middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life a house a child and good marriage still doesnt translate into a fulfilled life nafter glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on the train home from work sugiyana koji yakusho decides after some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in himself nafter finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant and beautiful mai tamiyo kusakari too rich for his blood sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her nwe then meet the players in this gem of a movie who all have their own reasons for joining the class nlater on we meet aoki at the dance studio naoto takenaka a coworker and all out weirdo and one of the laugh riot highlights of the film nthe story laughs and touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along nits a pleasure to watch such a wonderful film that is propelled almost solely by the characters and performances nits difficult to explain the charms of the film without revealing too much the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the characters and in the end each one is that much fuller and more understood by the time you leave the theater nits one of those movies that only the french seem to make anymore no big plot no special effects no gunplay no tragic consequences no forced examinations of the nature of love and no insights into the nature of evil njust a warm funny endearing film that will charm the pants off of you nwhen was the last time you left a theater feeling all warm and fuzzy inside n shall we dance will do that to you without any treacly aftertaste n

stendhals syndrome a condition where in the presence of art a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression suicidal behaviour and personality disorder ngrim stuff to be sure but the subject of a remarkable film from italys master of the horror thriller dario argento nboasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento nit follows his disappointing american debut trauma 1992 the patchy opera 1987 and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980s nbased on the novel by graziella magherini the film stars argentos daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapistkiller nvisiting florence to follow up several leads she is lured by the killer alfredo thomas kretschmann to an art gallery a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail nat the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints nposing as a bystander alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer a strange game of cat and mouse begins na gripping story evolves and a coherent one too which may surprise those familiar with argentos often lumpy narratives nthe stendhal syndrome is not a simple cophuntingkiller scenario nit is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central characters psychological disintegration nthe script explores its psychosexual themes with intelligence and candour perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers nbut as dark as its themes are the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years nargento is once again working in his native italy and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences neffects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent nthe films opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination flashback and realtime with tremendous style nproof that at his most inspired argento remains one of the worlds most exhilarating filmmakers nthe cast is generally good though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless nasia argentos performance is by turns risky awkward and fascinating nits a difficult role and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts nthomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo and marco leonardi of cinema paradiso and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy does okay as annas work colleague and increasingly confused love interest nbut perhaps the stendhal syndromes single most striking element is ennio morricones soundtrack nactive since the 1960s morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts nits mostly a variation on the one theme a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards nits been three decades since argento and morricone worked together nthis is a long welcome reunion nif the film has a fault it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesnt quite reach a completely satisfying climax nbut by the closing scenes the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argentos career n note see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can ndubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web n
 payback brian helgelands inauspicious directing debut coincidentally he previously penned the awardwinning screenplay for 1997s l a confidential is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one ideaa movie with nonstop violence death and villainsand runs with it or should i say barely manages to crawl away with it nmel gibson in yet another disappointing picture conspiracy theory and lethal weapon 4 anyone stars as the reprehensible villainhero porter a man who becomes determined to get his 50 share of 140 000 which he stole in a robbery back when his partnerincrime gregg henry and drugaddicted wife deborah kara unger doublecross him shoot him and leave him for dead nporter is not dead howevernot by a long shotas he quickly rehabilitates and along with his loyal prositute girlfriend rosie maria bello sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay nthe tagline for payback is get ready to root for the bad guy and sure enough this is true as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way ni wouldnt have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest but it wasnt and therefore i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever nno attempt is made to flesh the roles into threedimensional characters and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them njust because the protagonist a bad guy is played by mel gibson doesnt mean i will root for him and i didnt nquite the contrary every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death although some of them did anyway just to spice up the dull proceedings nsince none of the respectable actors in payback actually have human beings to play only one performance managed to stand out nlucy alexis liu of t v s ally mcbeal who plays a spicy sm dominatrix brightens up every scene she is in and has a definite flair for comedy something i would have liked to have seen more of since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat nmeanwhile gibson who is perfectly fine here sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging nunger who made an impression in 1997s the game is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in and only has two purproses 1 to get high on heroin and 2 because she plays a key part in an early flashback nfinally kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb tellingly he didnt appear in the original cut of the film but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later nlike most action movies the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking nin the course of the 102minute running time of payback porter is shot three times in the back hit by a van beaten up and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer nand guess what nnot only does he survive the whole ordeal but he is happygolucky in the penultimate sequence and can still walk neven though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag n payback is not in any way an entertaining film even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen nperhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours n
there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actors effort noften a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile nwhen one of these comes along i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders nbut sometimes there is simply no other explanation and such is the case with the hurricane nthis biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin hurricane carter would normally be called norman jewisons the hurricane as per the tradition of referring to a film belonging to a director nbut though he does decent work jewison cannot claim ownership of the hurricane because there is one reason this film works at all and his name is denzel washington nwashington plays carter a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a latenight shooting in a bar njailed for 20 years he maintained that he had never committed the crimes but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals nthe situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter nthrough the efforts of that group and carters lawyers he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted nthe film details carters childhood which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop dan hedaya nwhen he finally got out of prison for good carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer seemingly having his career on track until the police framed him for multiple homicide ndespite the efforts of political activists and celebrities he remained imprisoned nflash forward to 1983 when lesra vicellous reon shannon a young africanamerican boy living with a group of canadian tutors reads the book carter wrote while in prison nthe book entitled the sixteenth round opens young lesras eyes to the injustice that was carters life and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer nlesra convinces his canadian friends deborah unger liev schreiber john hannah to work with him towards his goal n the hurricane leans on denzel washington nhe must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will and he does so brilliantly nits probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be nit would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin cartera fictional personality invented solely for the film nthe actors work is masterful washington throws himself into every moment refusing to keep the audience at arms length nwe feel everything he feels the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost nwashingtons is a performance of weight and emotional depth nhe doesnt merely play angry happy or sad he feels it at the deepest level nhis work is masterful and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor nnorman jewison directs the film doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection n the hurricane moves quickly with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely njewison handles his multiple flashbacks well the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is and nothing is terribly confusing nhis boxing scenes constructed with clear inspiration from raging bull get inside the action very well and they are believable as real sports footage njewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform and jewison assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell njewisons best achievement in the hurricane is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hardknock life and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again nsadly though the films chief failures lie with the screenplay as with most of the goodbutnotgreat efforts to round the pike this winter nthere is much to interest a viewer in the hurricane but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich d route possible it does ntake a look at the supporting characters for example who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil ncarter and lesra played nicely by shannon who deserves credit are the only real people here everyone else is a stereotype nthe canadians are good nthe cops are bad nthe canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their loveydovey commune and it is a commune despite the films failure to make that clear while every racist cop especially dan hedayas melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room nmuch of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey hate put me in prison nloves gonna bust me out and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a madefortv lifetime special nits too bad nthe cast is game the director does his job and the subject matter is interesting but the script takes the safer slightly more boring route far too often ni wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than hes a racist pig ni wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice nin short i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens ncriticism has been levied against the liberties the hurricane takes with the truth of what really happened to carter and much of it is deserved nfor example the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello only to be screwed by the judges who ruled giardello the winner nmost accounts of the fight however have carter losing fairly nfurthermore much of carters criminal past is conveniently left out of the film and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained nof course the hurricane works mainly as a fable so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially but even dismissing such issues dont remove one fact the hurricane is a highly flawed film nonly one actor could have made a schmaltzy predictable picture like this work as well as it does and its a good thing the hurricane has that actor ncarter has been quoted as saying denzel washington is making me look good but hes not the only one nwashington makes this film look good ndenzel washingtons the hurricane nsounds pretty good to me n
mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival nas you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival nit may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time nin fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry ntoward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart nthe film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it nsomething else is what he did nthe film opens with a woman played by laura harring about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life nshe crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep nmeanwhile young vivacious betty naomi watts arrives in hollywood from canada nshe wants to build a career as an actress nbetty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow nshe does not know who the woman is nshe is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is nthey fix on a name rita for her but are not sure if this right or not nmeanwhile local director adam kesher justin theroux has problems of his own nhe is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else cammie rhodes melissa george nthese two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong nthere is also a strange character called the cowboy monty montgomery adding to the confusion nin what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits na lot of mulholland drive starts out fun nlynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film nhe just chooses not to nas with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason nthere are no earthworms but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches nthe film is a little long for the subject matter ntoward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes clearly not intended for the tv pilot nunfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers ni will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale nmulholland drive spoiler warning ni have rated this film fairly low nyou should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film ndavid lynch is in large part a dark satirist nmost of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside nin mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre nwhat he does with this film is are you sure you want to read this nplaying off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on nthe first 80 of the film he tells a simple multithread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout nthen suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something nthe audience expectation is that they will add up nbut he has given clues that are selfcontradictory nlynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories nin fact the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation i think lynch is merely playing a joke nthere is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties nmad magazine called it a poiuyt nother sources called it a tri pronged ubar nlook at small portions of it and makes sense nlook at the whole figure and it does not nthis film is in my estimation the cinematic equivalent of a tripronged ubar n
cinema has been around for about a hundred years now nits not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film but id like to think that im beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time nrecently ive seen the films of hitchcock capra fellini godard kurosawa chaplin lang and many others n those men were talented artists and their films reflect their genius nthey are likely to be remembered for n n nwell quite a while ni like this film too nyes its a disasterslashaction movie ntrue its budget is a lot more money than ill ever see in my lifetime nand theres not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money nin fact i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film had they thought it wouldve been more profitable ni certainly dont care what their intentions were because michael bay the rock is such a skilled director that i doubt hed ever make a film that is difficult to sit through nof course skillful direction doesnt complete the package but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together nthe story is wellthought out and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place the acting is terrific the script is sharp and get this there are characters nyes you read that right narmageddon actually has characters you can care about nif you dont like this film then you have a problem with the genre itself armageddon is as good as a film like this can be nif youve seen deep impact then you know the basic framework for the story nit turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film nso its up to the u s government to stop it n why the u s is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated ntheir plan to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid drill down several hundred feet and detonate a nuclear warhead within nthe head driller is harry stamper bruce willis nhis group of men is a colorful bunch including a j n ben affleck chick will patton and rockhound steve buscemi ntheres also an interesting triangle formed between a j harry and grace liv tyler who is harrys daughter na j nand grace are of course romantically intertwined and dad isnt too happy with the situation nits absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is youd like to call armageddon nits not about story its about viscera and action and thrillsaminute and all that stuff nits incidental really that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds thought to what actually happens nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better ni think most of the budget went to cameras alone because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles ntake the spectacular opening scene for instance in which a meteor shower obliterates new york na meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars nthe action itself might take five seconds in real life but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways ni like his quickedit style because its abrasive and exhausting to watch nits also very loud and obnoxiously noisy at times nbut its fun to be obnoxious sometimes nthe special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame ndeep impact visually has absolutely nothing on armageddon and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable nspecial effects are very important in a film like this if theyre not good then the image is not convincing and the film doesnt work neverything here looks bright and explosive from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid nthe effects that dont look totally real are still a pleasure to behold and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nicelooking that it actually qualifies as art nof course all of this would add up to little more than an aboveaverage light show if i didnt get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action nthe film is two and a half hours long and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters subplots ni wont suggest that these are complex characters but their problems are real and the emotions arent put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way nin fact there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up and thats a lot more than i can say about deep impact which was banking on the feelgood parts of its story nbruce willis is terrific and im glad to see him bigger than life again recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ntyler and affleck are great together and make a convincing couple all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level npatton who is a magnificent actor thankfully is not wasted here and the minor subplot revolving around his exwife and son is very moving nthe comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare who plays a crazy russian astronaut is nifty and keeps the film lively and funny ni wasnt challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon and i dont mind too much nbut the film doesnt insult my intelligence its pitched perfectly to entertain which is what all it really wants to do nits not mindless and escapist but wellcrafted cinema nit might have been created for the wrong reasons but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good in spite of the producers and the budget nim not saying that films like this are risky moves nwhat i am saying is that armageddon is a big loud expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms n
robin hood men in tights is another melbrooksproduced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein nmel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit nunfortunately robin hood men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles none of the fun acting of young frankenstein is devoid of the charm of spaceballs and is even lacking the good solid dialogue of history of the world nit is in short one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks or anybody else produce nthe plot borrows heavily from the wellreceived kevin costner movie of last year robin hood prince of thieves nthis is not surprising in and of itself and could have been used to great comic effect mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie nmel brooks does not take advantage of this however and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air none of which connect and none of which are explained later on nthe movies scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice ncary elwes of princess bride fame plays robin of loxley a man who was captured in the crusades fighting with king richard nhe escapes and joining with a man named achoo i am sure you can see the obvious joke fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard which has been captured by evil prince john played by funny comic richard lewis nhe also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil sheriff of rottingham na good adventure plot that is sadly unused nelwes and lewis are both excellent comics but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating nneither actor has any good words to work with and the lines simply arent funny nor believable nperhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone nthis particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas that i really felt like leaving the theatre nmuch of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout and some left the theatre nchuckles were few and far between and they mostly dealt with visual jokes such as an old beaten up horse from rentawreck then from any dialogue whatsoever nscenes that could have been classics such as the archery contest are ruined by poor acting nperhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive nthe basic plot that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian is not witty nor funny nmel brooks as a circumcisiongiving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience not all jewish either nthe movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails nthe addition of a blind man who stumbles around falling off cliffs walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential but is also made terribly offensive nthe only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard nhe is well worth waiting for if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue excruciating visual humor old puns ancient jokes and bad acting nif you cant dont even bother watching this miserable film n
