i didnt hate the big hit even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film nfor the entirety of its running time my eyes were attached to the screen and i never once got bored ni found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness this is such a confused disaster of a film that its entertaining to watch it in the same way that its entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl nas a narrative the big hit is pure garbage never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries nit reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways nits fine to mix genres if the film makers know what theyre doing nunfortunately writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong dont seem to know how to handle the material and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy nthe biggest problem with the amalgamation in this case is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place nbut it sure is a fascinating failure nmarky n n ner mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley a hitman nhes a good hitman apparently although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious he doesnt snipe or make clean killshe just kicks the door down and shoots everything nhe works with a few other hitmencisco lou diamond phillips crunch bokeem woodbine and vinnie antonio sabbato jr ntheyre a nice bunch of muscular guys who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex nthey all work for a man named paris avery brooks who is rich powerful and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen nit is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own this of course is where the plot comes in nthey decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko china chow who has a rich father nwhen they do this it turns out she is paris n n ngoddaughter nits very bad to have paris against you nthe story is standard action film stuff nits nothing new and nothing particularly offensive but certainly not the slightest bit compelling nclearly the major selling point of the big hit is that its a john wootype of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy nits true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea such as faceoff and the replacement killers which are both far superior nthere are stunts that are fun to watch the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story nthey use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns nmelvin is also very good at breakdancing and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives nlike i said its not boring most disasters arent nwhat makes it so bad is its genreshifting madness nit seems to start out as a quirkybutrealistic action comedy as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains nthen as soon as they go to their first hit it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere nthen somewhere in between it turns back into comedy nkeiko turns out to be a spunky little girl in one amusing scene she is forced to read a letter out loud indicating that she has been kidnapped but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words nand scenes like this work alone but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious or not be in the film at all none of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped when cisco gets there paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it but they let him out of there telling him to find the perpetrator nthe scene is played for laughs but it isnt funny nand since it doesnt quite work as a comedy it tries to fall back on the action which also fails nthis is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun ncars land on tree branches and are supported by them ncharacters betray each other without a second thought ngrenades are thrown in tight places npeople jump out of tall buildings and survive npeople outrun tumbling cars and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds nmost frustrating of all though is the films definition of a hit man these guys are anything but subtle quiet and skilled individuals ntheyre more like socially depraved militia men melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage including missile launchers and handheld machineguns nthe characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest this obviously doesnt make for deep or interesting people to watch nthe acting is kind of fun thoughwahlberg is a good actor and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way nphillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character while christina applegate who plays melvins fianc e is convincingly airheaded nthe big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny nthe funniest parts are supplied by the actors and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and oneliners nits a true disaster one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional ndespite all this though i must reiterate the entertainment value here nyou can cherish the awfulness of a film like this nif you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is you just might enjoy yourself n
teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood nevery year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights wallets in hand nthe formula is very simple you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal nyou add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes the typical teenage attention span nthe response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any film set in an environment they can relate to and most importantly they don92t care to judge films92 quality so any piece of trash will due nthat is just what never been kissed the latest film from director raja gosnell is trash njosie geller drew barrymore is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times nshe has her own personal assistant unlimited supplies and her own office nbut she is very much dismayed with her position in life nthere is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field where she can play a more active role in the chicago media nso when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere she jumps at it with elation nconstantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita molly shannon and her amicable superior gus john c reilly nthe two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter nhowever since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes and josie is headed for the field nobviously the field assignment involves a high school nspecifically she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school by enrolling in the senior class and becoming one of them ni don92t think that i need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring so i won92t nthe movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school ninterwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was and she appears to be heading down that road again nfortunately for this lame production other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting nthey include the predictable love stories between both a student jeremy jordan and a teacher michael vartan to show that josie is really two people in one body nalso her younger brother and opposite rob david arquette comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative nthe humor found in this film is actually quite amusing ntypical for teenage films it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor none scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical nmost of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy nbut those still don92t recover for the total lack of quality in this movie nfollowing this trend of high school movie rules comes the general acting nit is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film nin this case drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch nshe is required to play her character on two levels having some very black and white transitions nand although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time nat one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel and is expected to him on an adult level since he is one her teacher nbut she never seems to get out of the gray area and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance nfollowing barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon saturday night live nshe seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic nit is these qualities that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent nluckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film ndavid arquette scream takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic and not have his brilliant acting ruined nand as a central character he gets to take on his own miniplot which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed nin a dazzling cherryonthesundae type piece of work he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit risky business nnever been kissed is a mediocre film at best nthe predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood that it is sickening to watch time and again and this film is no exception nthe acting is just as bad but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light nunfortunately the bottom line is that the movie will be a success because teenagers will pay to see any trash n
my friend here in film school just made a two minutelong film for one of his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident with a banana being used as the instrument of penetration nas sick as this all is watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments ive ever witnessed nsure it may be in bad taste but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest nthen theres caligula nthis film features incest necrophilia beastuality anal rape homosexual felatio of both sexes elaborate and lengthy orgies a greasedup fist forced up a mans rear wine poured down a man whos had his urinary tracts tied off a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs etc etc etc this could very well be a respectable film and if could have been had the following not occurred a the events were graphically shot in clear view b the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to well show historical accuracy c the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets a rather impressive cast and a whopping 2 12 hour running time nproduced and funded by none other than bob guccione owner of penthouse magazine caligula comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since plan 9 from outer space because underneath theres a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified but also brilliantly entertaining nafter all its not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry nno film should be discarded because its content because film is never about what its about its about how its about as the old cliche goes nthose who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with caligula and thats that its nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time n caligula allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing or nso i guess even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons nthe film opens on the wrong note of course with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen using the overused passage what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer fucking around with his own sister in a field i suppose if one has to lose their soul one has to have a soul in the first place nthe plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell a performance that does the opposite that his performance in a clockwork orange did is next in line for the throne but cant wait for the current emporer tiberius peter o toole ditto only for his performance in lawrence of arabia his grandfather to die so he kills him and ascends to the throne nthen he abuses his position marries a woman helen mirren who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting so he doesnt just have to sleep with his sister a dreadful teresa ann savoy there to be pretty naked and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with abuses his position a little more a little more and a little more and then i believe invades england then is killed off nthe filler instead of recounting his life is supposed to be as guccione claims the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome complete with orgies vicious deaths and lots of nudity nbut instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be it instead becomes gucciones twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like noh isnt it great that they just loved having sex nand that they killed people so disgustingly nand wouldnt it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though its so blatantly real bad porn that ive completely convinced myself that its not ni mean why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up nand its not just that its disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film its that in a film where the entire feel its going for isnt felt its also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time nthe sets are lavish but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this nbut that doesnt matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all making this not only dark and ugly but just plain dark nthe camera operation is also the worst ive ever seen in my entire life nnot only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them then have them out of focus nthe editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow nthere is no writer to speak of what the hell does it mean that its adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal but nevertheless the dialogue is shit so laughably bad that i cant in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius he could go at any moment but with care he could last a year or so nthe music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian they use his gorgeous adagio of spartacus and phrygia ad nauseum used in an attempt to give the film some emotion but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere nthe orgy scenes and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo are the result of reshoots by guccione himself which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment every five seconds or so the film cuts to random nudity as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated x njohn gielgud represents the only voice of sanity walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra im going to kill my agent im going to kill my agent nand so on and so on for over 2 12 hours making caligula about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying nguccione in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage nthroughout the entire film the presence of guccione is easily felt as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen pretentiously looking down upon us saying look what i can get away with nand if you dont like this then youre a prig and worse than that you know nothing about history nuh huh ntheres a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something thats artistically good na film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last that would probably make for a good film nbut using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgustingfordisgustingnesssake acts is total total bullshit and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both judging from this film ntheres a film that came out in 1989 called the cook the thief his wife and her lover a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway also starring helen mirren which deals with graphic sex heartstopping violence and gore and even a little cannibalism for good measure nthat film not only never patronized its viewers but also handled them in a way that was shocking yes but also in a bizarre way entertaining and totally involving nthere were real characters there in a real situation and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that its going to be offensive to many nthat film achieved everything it wanted to do and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good nand its everything caligula might have been but alas wasnt n

in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this frenchcanadian coproduction by max fischer nthe movie is set in paris where its hero struggling american author david mirkine judd nelson at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity suffers a terrible writers bloc nhe manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle laurence treill nunfortunately she hangs out in jet set circles which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous nher connection with powerful david caravan pierce brosnan would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events nalthough few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller drama would probably be more appropriate genre label npacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments nlow budget also becomes painfully visible and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film nunfortunately this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed ninstead they would have to settle with pointless slow scenes involving nelson brosnan and laurence treills attempts of serious acting nall of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someones precious time n

any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project as a perfect murder illustrates nfrankly dial m for murder is not one of the master directors greatest efforts so there is ample room for improvement nunfortunately instead of updating the script ironing out some of the faults and speeding up the pace a little a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder leaving behind the nearly unwatchable wreckage of a wouldbe 90s thriller nalmost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities nthe best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in whats going on so that these flaws in logic dont become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled nunfortunately in a perfect murder the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as theyre happening nthis is a very bad sign nnot only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder nof course in the case of a perfect murder at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless cardboard characters na perfect murder isnt a strict remake of dial m for murder but it does borrow heavily from frederick knotts play which was also the source material for hitchcocks version as well as a 1981 madefortv retelling nemily hayes gwyneth paltrow is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street moverandshaker steven hayes michael douglas ntheir marriage isnt going well emily resents stevens controlling instincts and as a form of rebellion she is having an affair with a penniless painter david shaw viggo mortensen nwhen steven learns of the relationship he decides to confront david but his approach isnt that of a typical cuckolded husband ninstead of yelling or threatening steven offers david a proposal thats too good to resist for 500 000 in cash 100 000 before the rest after he is to break into stevens new york apartment and kill emily n of course after getting the first payment david never bothers to ask how hes supposed to get the rest nultimately im not sure which of the three main characters were supposed to be sympathetic to the coldhearted husband who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune her mercenary lover who is willing to do the deed for halfamillion or the woman who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair nnot only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable but theyre not interesting n its possible to make a good movie with detestable characters see reservoir dogs but there has to be something compelling about them which in this case there isnt nsteven emily and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes nthe actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks nmichael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep hes gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife ngwyneth paltrow who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors is simply awful here nshe now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998s worst thrillers the other being hush nat least viggo mortensen g i njane has a little fun with his part but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies nthe thin supporting cast includes david suchet the star of poirot as a police inspector and sarita choudhury kama sutra as emilys best friend na perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end nthere arent many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start nits surprising to see director andrew davis the man behind the fugitive involved in this mess but like his stars he too needs to earn a living nits just that remaking hitchcock and doing it so badly hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough n
its almost amusing to watch 21year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potters followup to 1997s the tango lesson the man who cried nthe geny actress with her cold stare and big black eyes has appeared in an impressive range of films but she doesnt even come close to being the bold heroine the film set against the historical backdrop of world war 2 requires her to be nricci whose character is shockingly silent and blank showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett quite an amusing sight to behold nblanchetts lola a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie is bold interesting and layered everything our heroine lacks ncostar of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe nthe actress inhabits the role as she always so remarkably does with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the films lead rather than her dull companion nimportant historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film these landmarks serve as the films little conflict nobviously the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues nthe man who cried has many aspirations none of which come full circle by the films close nthere are forced messages here and there go forward always go forward lola preaches to suzie theres romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitlers nazis the gypsy cesar johnny depp who like ricci barely gets to speak lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it and at the core of all these devices lies suzies desire to travel to america where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago nthe films main problem is that potter isnt skilled enough to tell the epicsized story of suzie nthe time periods instability the conflicting social classes the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life serving as both writer and director potter throws in some of each but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any nby the time the sighinducing climax hits the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater nthe films falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely are we really meant to believe any of this could happen ncontrastingly in its moving final scene the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film nalthough its apparent that potter cant grasp what she reaches im puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place nriccis suzie is meant to be the films core from the extended flashback at the films beginning to the quickly drawn ending everything seen in the film in some way relates to her nso why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals nthe character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble but not present enough for the film to be riccis nthe almost constant lack of flow and onenote tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha viernys beautiful cinematography that renders the films various locations wonderfully nalso worthy of note are lindy hemmings costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely nand then theres the music nfrom minute one to minute ninetyseven theres hardly a moment when the wavering skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music dont undercut the action the notes stricken both overwhelm particularly john turturro portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio whose money and reputation catch lolas interest and accompany oftentimes the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the films characters and reinforce that state npotter obviously cares much about each and every musical note unfortunately the same effort isnt given towards almost everything else n

hav plenty as we are told in the beginning and reminded during the film is a true story nlife itself is a series of true stories but most are not movie material nas scripted directed and acted by cinematic newcomer christopher scott cherot hav plenty limps along at best nits dialog is so stilted you know what they say no women no cry n that the actors are content to read the screenplay rather than invest much energy in trying to act it nin the story lee plenty cherot is a 28yearold author and teaching assistant nthe movie which happens mainly over the new years holiday consists of a series of incidents in which various single and married women try to kiss lee or take him to bed nsince he consistently refuses caroline gooden tammi katherine jones figures that he must be gay neventually he and havilland hav savage chenoa maxwell get together proving that he wasnt gay after all just picky nsexy women can sit on his lap and ask him to go to bed with them but he will not even kiss them nhes a man who knows his mind which he frequently shares directly with the audience in a series of trite and overly cute monologues nfilled with wealthy africanamericans the story is closest in tone to love jones which was better nhav plentys story doesnt go anywhere nat the end it subjects us to lee plentys new film which is a movie of the movie weve just seen but with even worse acting n remember folks that as outrageous as this all seems this is a true story nhav tells the camera but the problem is that its not outrageous at all or even the least bit interesting nhav plenty isnt so much a bad film as it is a total waste of the audiences time nhav plenty runs 1 32 nit is rated r for profanity and would be fine for most teenagers n
apparantly money talks n n nand uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so nive always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess whether in language violence sex or what have you ni find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard and money talks definitely does nits not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly and i mean constantly but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged nperhaps if one character were foul mouthed but in this film everybody swears nearly every other word nmoney talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker nfranklin is your typical conman and ends up with more than one person out to get him nwhen the plot finally gets underway theres no less than three people or groups that want him dead or alive nthe frenchman whos somewhat responsible for franklins escape from a prisonerpacked bus a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder nfranklins only hope james russell charlie sheen an investigative reporter for the local news whos out to prove himself a worthy journalist njames offers to help clear franklins name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week nboth of these elements are completely lost along the way however and never do reappear nas expected the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way nthere is just nothing original or intriguing about this film and so many developments are either nonrelevant or just plain forgotten about nmoney talks is a paintbynumbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience nfrivilous dialogue a predictable flat storyline and twodimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money n
all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos please raise your hands nthank you for identifying yourselves now would you all please go away nyour influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade and it shows no sign of abating any time soon nit isnt just the strobe light quality of your twentycutsperminute editing or the numbing overuse of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised featuring the music of no it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles nwelcome to the club scott kalvert nyour adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and onedimensional serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole ndicaprio stars as jim carroll the new york poetsongwriter performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based nas the film opens jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey mark wahlberg pedro james madio and neutron patrick mcgaw none night jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine and shortly thereafter to heroin njims addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach bruno kirby kicked out of his home by his mother lorraine bracco and drops out of school nalong with mickey and pedro jim becomes a victim of the street living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower nthe basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner nscreenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carrolls posse resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic but now with equally unsympathetic friends nas a film the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale a 100 minute long just say no public service announcement but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie njim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie but i suppose that his pseudosensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out nperhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd nwithout a character who changes in any appreciable way the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strungout cohorts all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack ndirector scott kalvert doesnt have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work so he substitutes silly slowmotion photography selfconsciously funky camera angles and choppy editing non only one occasion when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in are any of the gimmicks effective nmostly they just draw attention to how hollow the story is nthey also dont allow leonardo dicaprios performance to be as strong as it could have been nfor every impressive moment like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics ndicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an exjunkie who tries to help jim straighten out but kalvert wont let character interaction define this story nhe wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting nat isolate moments the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprios talents nfar more frequently it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like n
vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico nthe house has a nest of vampires and jack crow james woods is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out nwhile the initial imagery is a little overdramatic it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence nthat is enough action to last us a while and we could director john carpenter would let us get to a story line nbut it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene nthen there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that nthe plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end nand that is something of a pity because the film based on the book vampire by john steakley gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery nthis could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it nwhat carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires nthere is a lot of fighting and lots of gore nanything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans nthis has not always been carpenters style nhis 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the films central science fictional question njack crow heads a vampire swat team cleaning up nests of vampires with hightech spears and crossbows nin the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek thomas ian griffith who has been tipped off to who crow is nnow crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya daniel baldwin nto make matters worse he does not know the people on his own side tony and his backers he can trust nmeanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico nif this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions thats exactly what it is nthe same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin nbut carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film show people dont tell them njust about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown nfundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding why are the vampires in new mexicowhat do they want and why do they want it what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it nthe answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized but instead are revealed through dialog nnow if all this was not bad enough carpenter misuses the james wood persona nwoods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well nbut carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergioleone style mythic posturing nwhile his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target nwoods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero nthat is not his style and it just does not work very well nthere are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses nin one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor none female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair nas the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down none also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret nthese vampires do not maintain a low profile nthere are arguably logical flaws in the film nthere is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires nit would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight ni suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out nwhile i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale nperhaps i will read the book n
movies dont come much more ridiculously titled than i still know what you did last summer but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous the title sort of works as a warning nmore than a sillysounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor this horror sequels moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot what you did last summer you actually did the summer before last summer and since i knew about it this summer as well as last summer its really illogical to say that i still know what you did last summer nthe filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter i still know the longer i still know what you did two summers ago or the appropriate stupid people getting hacked to bits nthat last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart nfor example if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress nprobably not but thats precisely what college student karla pop diva brandy does to best friend julie jennifer love hewitt resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights njulie youll recall was one of the sole survivors at the end of 1997s surprise hit i know what you did last summer after a slasher with a grudge to bear its a long story began trying to pick off her her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village nin this installment the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas and julie yet racked by guilt decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind nyeah right ntheir island paradise has room of course for one more in the form of the stillalive killer muse watson from the first film nhe sports the same gortons fisherman getup a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity but why hes still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves nthough i suppose his hookhand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit nin a sense thats the movies glaring flaw everybody knows who the bad guy is thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel nthe murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary but trey callaways derivative i still know screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims nwhen julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all what does he do nhe twistties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays youd think hed want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later neven prequel summer lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neato shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh nthe innovative gallows humor that scribe and scream wunderkind kevin williamson injected into i know s unfolding story is sorely missed replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like yo youll cheer not shriek when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest nif i know what you did last summer however effective was just the kind of movie that those subversive scream flicks poked fun at then the deadly i still know what you did last summer deserves a fullblown roasting on mystery science theatre 3000 n
capsule where are you tonight leni rienfenstal nstarship troopers is an expensive hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography and bad pornography at that nit is not good cinema not good storytelling and not even stupid fun its so cynically calculatedly boneheaded that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed nits one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time nwhy am i calling this movie pornography npornography in the abstract is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts ni remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper as a nearpornographic eternity ni didnt agree with that assessment but i could see what was being implied the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout do er man do er nthat sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers nits literally like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk nit tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening nthe film takes place in our future when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesnt appear to have intelligence nto counterattack humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable instead of nuke the planet from orbit which theyre clearly capable of they send down grunts with m16 rifles nthis isnt heinlein its a bad wwii movie one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy repetitive and ultimately tiresome n one scene has a journalist on a battlefield filimg soldiers being slaughtered and ends with groaning predictability said cameraman gets skewered too nthe soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic nthey do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense nthey dont even behave like soldiers in a bad movie and therefore we dont care about them nwe hated the tom berenger character in platoon but he mattered and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate nhere we dont even hate the bugs whats there to hate nhating them would be like cursing a hurricaine nif theres anything really hateful there the movie doesnt know how to give it to us nthe screenwriter ed neumeier perhaps a better appelation would be screen typist and director the increasingly talentimpaired paul verhoeven have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other none of the subplots concerns a woman pilot whos great at getting out of tight situations and does it again and again and again nonce or twice is fine nby the fifth or sixth time its worn out its welcome ntheres never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything or really being tested to show their mettle nalso the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry nif a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing nbut if one human gets cornered he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip nuhhuh nthe very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasifascist flavor ni say quasi because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action the gear the uniforms etc the movie doesnt have the nerve or the brains to be genuinely fascist or intelligent about the subject nthe bumpers between scenes which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison nlike the rest of the movie ntheres more i suppose but its not worth it nthe acting is bland neither arsenic nor gravy the music disposable the camerawork turgid nthe heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece n

topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devils advocate movies that have a brilliant beginning but dont know how to end nit begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other nthere is liz who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment prue who is getting married geoff lizs boyfriend neil her previous boyfriend ant who has written a screenplay nfor the first hour we get to know these people through everyday activities as they talk on the phone go out to dinner hang clothes on the line nthe interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the filmmakers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them nat times the events border on the ridiculous like the screening of the film but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives nthis doesnt sound like a brilliant premise for a film we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related but its the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing nunfortunately this level of honesty isnt maintained nwith about half an hour to go a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama nsuch a disappointment after such a brilliant start nthe actors are all quite good with ms danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive nthe energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable na lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film nit seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles nthat is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock nup till that point i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place nwhile the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility its unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film nnot just the events but also the tone of some of the end is wrong clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it nthis is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film nas stated above the first hour is superb and even the end is above average nit just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss n
welcome to your ohso typical sequel nit tries to be twice as big as its predecessor yet ends up twice as shallow nshallow hmm now theres an idea nmaybe if the illfated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better nthe first thing that struck me and nsurprised me was that the camera work for the opening sequence anyway was terrible nlooked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet very ndifferent to the original movie nthe characters nwell not many of the characters actually had characters but heres a rundown nannie who was the highlight of the the original must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie nwhy nbecause somethings got to account for her losing that many iq points neven though annie wasnt exactly a rocket scientist in speed here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall nfor instance after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people cant get ut till she gets the chainsaw out of their faces bang nbang bang nin point of fact sandras character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules who constantly has to be rescued njason patric nall i can say is bring back keanu nkeanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump but nthats one more tree stump than jason has ni dont think he changed facial expressions all movie jason smile for the cameras nnow frown i said frown oh you are bang nbang bang nwooden just doesnt describe this guys performance but itll have to do nthe bad guy ahh william ndafoe theres a bright move nhow can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic body of evidence n yes that is sarcasm nhis wide eyed maniac of a character doesnt start out too bad but ngoes steadily downhill as the movie progresses nin the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for a hostage even though he already has the money and can escape bang nbang nthough id like to give this movie a double thumbs down there were some nice sequences nconsidering the movie cost over 100 million dollars youd hope thered be at least a couple nthe real eyepopper for me even though it was given away in the trailer bang nbang was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker nthis looks terrific and i was very surprised to hear that the cruise liner in it was completely ncomputer generated nwow i ndont think ive ever seen a cg model look so real before nthe sequence where jason patric in trying to disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific and the only time during the entire movie where you get that feeling of speed nthis lackofspeed problem affects many sequences nsuch as the oil tanker part it was oh no were going to hit the oil tanker n20 minutes later oh no were going to hit the oil tanker n20 min you nget the point nthis movie failed simply because it didnt live up to its name there nwas very little feeling of speed nin the original movie the lead characters had to make split second decisions to survive in this movie it felt more like well people were gonna run into that there island in a few hours i think i might stroll over to engineering and see if i cant turn off the engines im npassing the cafeteria on the way can i get anybody anything nthe ending of this movie really is terrible neven though it features what ive since found out is one of the most expensive sequences ever in a movie it just doesnt work at all nthe part where the liner crashes through the town looks very realistic but surprise nsurprise it just takes waaaaay too long nit seemed to go for 15 minutes before the ship finally stopped none thing that struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through the harbour and town around 25 people are killed by the ship and ntheres only 15 or so people left on the ship nso when it stops safe and sound and the characters are all cheering the audience is sitting back and thinking wait a sec this is a happy moment because nbang bang nthen there was the dog i nalmost fell out of my seat when i saw the bit with the dog dodging the falling debris nputting a dog in peril has become the ultimate hollywood cliche every nmovie seems to have a dogindanger sequence volcano dantes peak independence day daylight twister nlost world etc netc nthis movie is a perfect example of how not to make a sequel ndirector jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie and this one backtoback and see if he realises where he went wrong n

the kids in the hall are an acquired taste nit took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer nmaybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies they would grow into the big screen nmy recommendation is that unless you are a big fan of the kids skip the film nas it is their firstand most likely onlyattempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv na bigbudget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show nthe kids go through the motions but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so nand this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics nbrain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression nin typical sketchcomedy tradition each actor plays several roles ndoctor cooper kevin mcdonald and his team create the drug nthen under pressure from don roritor mark mckinney founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals dr cooper releases the drug into the marketplace nthe ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film nat about 90 minutes brain candy still seems long nthe best thing about sketch comedyand the kids are no exceptionis the ability to quickly deliver the laughs then go on to another quick skit nbut with the additional setup necessary in telling a longer coherent story the laughs just dont come fast enough nstrangely the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv nthe movie makes several attempts at risquenessmostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons charactersbut they seem almost forced as if they have to live up to a pg rating none of the best bits though does make use of thompsons naked buttocks we see him charging into battlegoing to have sex with some guys taking a shower nin the classic of this genre monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail nthe kids unfortunately are not up to the task nthere are some amusing moments to be sure but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one n
ever since wargames the first real computer hacking movie hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking nthese films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous nif its not this the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect nhackers is guilty of all of these crimes nto anyone familiar with computers andor the internet most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you cant take it anymore nthose of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web the internet movie database are probably aware of the section for movies entitled goofs nthis is the section for mistakes in the movies nwell imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed generally illinformed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology nand truthfully this is onehundred percent correct nthe plot obviously centers around computer hacking nmore specifically it follows the exploits of dade murphy a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller nmiller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting because if it were not for that who knows where his career would be now after hackers nthe film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems nhe was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old nthe film then picks up at that point an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer ndade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn angelina jolie cereal killer matthew lillard lord nikon laurence mason and the phantom phreak renoly santiago who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi noh and as a little subplot dade also tries to woo acid burn the only female hacker in the film nreally i cant think of much more to say about the films plot aside from what ive said nits just a bunch of computer geeks no obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi nthanks to this movie the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do nthis movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list nto sum it up hackers is a terrible computer film nif youre looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world i suggest sneakers nalthough at times it too may seem a little far fetched it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users nhopefully this film didnt influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time n
over 40 years ago a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankinds nuclear testing npartly flight of fancy partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo na year later gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things a new name a dubbed english track and raymond burr nas godzilla the film took on the rest of the world nthirty years later toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things yes including raymond burr and called it godzilla 1985 nnow its 14 years after tohos remake and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run nin emmerichs godzilla matthew broderick plays dr niko tatopoulos a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiationinduced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms nwhen the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states nmeanwhile tatopouloss college girlfriend audrey timmonds maria pitillo works in new york city as an assistant to a bigtime news reporter nshed like to be a reporter herself and when godzilla comes ashore she figures this is her big break nof course with the big guy running amok in the city niko and audrey are bound to cross paths and are joined by victor animal palotti hank azaria audreys trusty cameraman friend and phillipe roche jean reno an operative for the french government whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place ntogether they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla nwith the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nations premiere movie production companies one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla nhe didnt nright up there with the lost world godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history nthe plot is pretty much what we expect the big dinosaurlike creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city and its up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down nthe script however is painfully bad nits fraught with lines so corny they dont even belong in bmovies and includes many character actions which make you think you idiot or you stupid girl ni suppose when youve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well nwhy is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them but is conveniently able to leap atop others nwhy do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line nwhy do sidewinder missiles which have small explosive warheads blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla nwhy is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f18 fighterbombers when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two nokay maybe the last one was a bit nitpicky but hey i was on a roll nbroderick is usually a good actor but in this film hes weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way nhank azaria does what he can but dont expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage nlike brodericks azarias character is quite simply lacking in color nwhat really annoyed me was maria pitillo who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting ncasting must have been asleep on this one nthe one bright spot here is jean reno who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic quite unlike what weve seem him do in the past nalthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable nunfortunately the same cannot be said of the other incongruities nthe entire feel of the movie is tongueincheek and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it nthis results in a significant amount of parody which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster and ends up just producing a mess nmost of the characters seem to be there for comic relief and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously nalthough emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens nif we cant take the characters seriously the threat they face is an empty one because we simply dont care what happens to them ngodzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more lighthearted than it should be nfar be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters but heres a behemoth running through the city ntheres bound to be a lot of casualties but instead godzilla is afflicted with the afterschool g i njoe cartoon syndrome where almost everyone seems to get out of harms way just in time nin a couple of scenes godzilla briefly breathes fire nnone of the characters even remark upon this ability nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers nits as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes godzilla can do this just like in the old movie nconsider another punch pulled nthrough creative script writing you can make a sequel out of just about any movie but the final scene in this one doesnt just leave the door open it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently nit made me want to gag nemmerich should have done away with 90 of the humor and injokes and played this one as a straight action film nwith an intelligently written screenplay godzilla could have been so much more nhowever by confusing the viewer with a ton of addins and parodies the movie ends up being something that just doesnt work nnow if they only had raymond burr n
everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here nwincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence nbilly zane is wooden as the hero nkristy swanson is given very little to do and does very little with it ntreat williams looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie nonly catherine zeta jones as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance nshe has energy and spunk which the movie needed much more of noh yeah the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you wont even care nabout the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones and some colorful scenery nhowever if youre looking for a fun family movie go watch the underrated flipper nthis is not a good movie n
prereview note seeing as the only concern of body shots is sex i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review nbecause of this i will try to vary word descriptions of sex meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms and or your name is jerry falwell you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend fret not its most likely just another way of referring to sex ni think wed all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review nthough not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what nbody shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously in the way youd normally expect to see a violent attack nits about people who think about screwing seek it out and talk about it nthese are things we all do sometimes nthe characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts ntheir lives center around the next sexual encounter but they seemed depressed nits as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek nat its core body shots is a message movie the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition nmichael cristoffer who directed gia another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil is a moralist with nothing new to say nhis characters dont communicate anything of interest to each other so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera nthey voice simplistic platitudes like i like to come or sex without love equals violence nhuh nand yes that is as complex as this movies observations get nthe characters are stupid and shallow with not one registering as anything more nthe plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure then the after math the morning after of such events nwe meet the characters as they speak directly to us confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy ni would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them giving you the pros and cons but for this film i cannot nim not trying to be clever or witty but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others nwith the exception of trent played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman the rest fade into each other a patchwork of fake breasts defined abs pearly white teeth and creamy flawless skin ni vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one only because his character gets the worst lines sex without love equals violence nin between all the confessionals cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning nthe fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me nthis film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining nif body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f kobsessed fine i dont have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way but cristoffer only gives us one side nadditionally that one side isnt even entertaining the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness nor realism none sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters nthey suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other alas if it could only be that easy kidding of course then not only isnt it erotic it isnt real nit doesnt feel like an authentic sexual encounter nevery f k scene in this film and there are many is treated in the same unsexy manner nbody shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film nit shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it and most of all it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it nthe resulting search for nookie and you can take that cookie over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow nthe main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred nthe film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape one where it is consensual the other where it is not and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off nthis is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently and if memory serves me i cant think of one film that has done so and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80s next to wall street nunfortunately nobody gives us reason to care not the writer the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off npaul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here though boogie nights succeeded nit was similarly moralistic but it gave us two different viewpoints it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters and it showed us the possible fallout of such a decision nthe characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here but anderson seemed to care about them nhe gave them heart ncristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones nhe preaches to us by using his characters to preach to us nthis is not the way to get any message across nwhy not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin skins ncristofer kind of does that though without an ounce of insight and with a helping of leering exploitation n
sometimes when i decide to write a short story or a poem i think of a title first and then think of a subject to go with it nit seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence ni wouldnt be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it nthe title sequence is so good so ominous and original that it had me engrossed before the picture even began nof course my attention dwindled shortly into the film ndisturbing behavior like so many thrillers starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous nits a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex nits a suspense film with no suspense nits an evil small town story with no story to speak of nits a disaster a listless and uninspired disaster that just barely misses onestardom because of a few good sequences a mercifully short running time and one terrific set of opening credits nour main man is a fellow named steve clark blandly played by jimmy marsden nhe moves to a small town with his family after tragically his brother shoots himself nsteve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother we learn this through strange homevideo like nightmares that he has occasionally nthe big trial for steve is of course to fit in at school and make new friends nmarsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject nas a social reject he falls in with some pretentious dopesmoking philosophers gavin nick stahl and rachel katie holmes ngavin informs steve that the local group of jocks known as the blue ribboners are actually a bunch of zombies assimilating new members into their group while sporadically killing innocent people nso its up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 solve the mystery and 2 do something about it nby the end of it all something has happened and things have been explained but the film still doesnt make any sense ndisturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg nive seen his name around recently he was one of the toucheruppers on the armageddon script and i imagine that for the most part he knows what hes doing when it comes to screenwriting nhe did however have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film and then decided to actually take the time to write it out nevil small town films are pretty common the last one phantoms is also a dismal failure but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work nrosenbergs script is a complete mess lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization nand it makes no sense nor is their any purpose when things are finally explained nthere is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks but the film never explains exactly what is happening nthey get strapped to chairs a microchip is inserted into their eyes and poof they become sexcrazed superviolent machinelike creatures nthe doctor responsible for all this dr caldicott bruce greenwood must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave or perhaps this is the only realistic element in the film nmuch of the writing is simply bad and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act nin one terrible scene gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques while pointing them out in the cafeteria nup front i should say that in four years of high school i did not eat in the cafeteria even once nthat aside the various social groups he points out are general uninteresting and poorlyshown nfor instance he points to the nerds who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops nits such an obvious cliche that i cant believe rosenberg even bothered nmost of the dialogue is forced no one says bite me nanymore and none of the scenes have any degree of wit nthis picture is not inspired and most scenes flop from one to the other with no sense of momentum or energy nthe blame for this can be placed on director david nutter who apparently likes his films dry nhorror films should at least exploit violence but this one is shockingly timid nthere are a few good scenes though such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum this is however the most forced scene in the film for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ni also liked the school janitor character played by william sadler nhe has a few lines that are surprisingly thoughtprovoking nthe acting is largely a waste of talent nmarsden is as i said bland thought not particularly bad nbruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted nstahl and holmes both show they have talent but the direction isnt good enough to hone in on their skills stahls performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads nnone of these characters expand beyond their one dimension and frankly watching cardboard cutouts of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isnt all that cool ndisturbing behavior is a wreck of a film and it started out a wreck before shooting even began nim surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film or that it would make a lot of money at the box office nits not boring or even blatantly awful but its an uninspired lump of a film nit sure starts off nicely but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable nso if you go to see this film take my advice appreciate the credit sequence and pray it never ends n
capsule the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension nalien 3 the 3 should be in superscript is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen nit continues the story of ripley the spacetruckerturnedimpromptusurvivalist but seems remarkably uninterested in her nin fact the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all its so elegaic and limp na little of this would have been nice for atmosphere but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning nat the end of the last film aliens ripley and two survivors were on their way home nunfortunately an alien pod had been deposited in their ship and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod nthe pod crashes on firorina 161 a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent nripley lives through the crash the others do not nthe prison is a grim place even as prisons go its been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks which provides no end of technogothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against nlice are endemic and so ripleys head is shaved another surreal touch nat first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive but it doesnt stay that way none of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches and soon a newlygestated alien is running amuck nworse it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated nwhats weird is how little tension this generates except near the end when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable loud music shaky camerawork etc sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role and she does well with it but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack nthe supporting actors are also not given a lot to do the doctor charles dance and another rather religious inmate charles s dutton very good hiave presence but theyre not asked to do anything with it nin light of the impending sequel which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie i will not talk about the ending except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie nits strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldnt have driven the rest of it n

every now and then reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed nmost of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact either good or bad that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings nbut sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons ni love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review nthe impression left by the film wasnt overwhelming on the contrary there were hardly any impression at all since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it nwhich surprise me to this day because the movie theatre was full i was close to sound speakers the show wasnt late and i didnt lack sleep before the show nsuch things happen very rarely to me and after many years the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself nthe plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters old peter brackett nick nolte and young aspiring sabrina peterson julia roberts ntwo of them are assigned to cover the train collision nas soon as they meet they start scooping each other but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk and also the romantic feelings they have for each other nthe plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d tre romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn nmovie author director and screenwriter charles shyer who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride tries again this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts nhowever although there is some chemistry between the two soon it stops to arouse any interest nit probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix that collides lighthearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers nshyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two and fails in both areas making the story cliched and predictable nthe end result is rather forgettable effort which convinced me not to watch movie again nill give it the benefit of the doubt though n
as any reasonable human being would i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things ni am befuddled by fight club nnow sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later nperhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time nperhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them nfight club is either garbage or brilliant but at least right now i must lean toward the former nmaybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold nbut if it is i sure don t see it nedward norton plays jack a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer nhis insomnia coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to complete himself make him a loser at the game of life nbut when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window he seeks comfort in a stranger tyler pitt whom he met on a flight home nonce jack is sucked into tyler s world he can t get out literally nthey begin fight club an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging nas the fight club grows things get out of control and take on cult status beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler s house for three days ni dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film since that contains the twist that explains the pointless journey nsuffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher who s previous two films se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation nthis is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table nbut with fight club he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and selfreferencing film elements such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good flashback humor nnow throughout the film s coarsely woven texture and overextended plot lines fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today nadvertisements interoffice politics corporations you name it it s addressed n though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced nall of them play an important role nhow so nwell i can kinda just tell ni can t really put my finger on it nto say that starbucks and barnes noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news nis that bad for the world nprobably nnot much room for social commentary there nwe all know that interoffice politics are just that politics nso what was the point of all this nthe film seems desperate to make a point or a number of points but i couldn t figure out what they were nall i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques a bleak visual design and some fine acting n pitt carter norton all of them are good neven meatloaf is good nwhen you get to the end you will most likely be filled with questions many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself nnot them because each of them would likely give you a different answer nfight club means what you want it to mean i think fincher just gives you the stuff to think about nbut it couldn t be more bizarre and unappealing nsure it had shock value but so did se7en and the game and they were significantly stronger films n
when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie nhowever since this film also featured michael madsen more than capable character actor this time in the role of protagonist the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt nhowever the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials madsen plays richard montana tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio played by lynch nhowever the raid was only partially successful and montana is getting the rap nso he begins his own private war against gio trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt nin the process he meets gios mistress gina zamora played by rosie vela and starts relationship with her too nalthough it doesnt stink like many of the similar films can inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine nnobody in this film actually puts much effort including madsen or lynch and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke nthe only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela who apart from showing her more than impressive looks shows some of the singing talent too nhowever this isnt reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would in most likelihood forget the next day n

the happy bastards quick movie review nwild wild west na better name for this movie mightve been wild wild waste nwarner bros in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie had managed to lasso in some big names actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld the duo behind mibs success in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster a contemporary bigscreen update to the classic westernscifi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad nbut somehow they ran into a problem along the way nthey were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that wouldve made all the difference a story writer nwild wild wests story and script was compiled by six different people rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black ed solomon nif warner bros had gotten him the movie wouldve possibly been five times better than what it is nheck ten times nas is however the story and screenplay is a mess filled with dead laughs enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as hes performing them and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well nheres the story us army member james west will smith teams up with creative genius artemus gordon kevin kline to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless kenneth branagh whose lower half was blown off during the civil war leaving him to roll around in a steamcontrolled wheelchair nthey catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80foot tarantula although it looks bigger than that hellbent on destroying anything in its path nas i said the way the script unfolds is a complete mess nbut the acting doesnt help either nkevin kline is miserable as gordon failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado nsmith seems to be having a better time as west although hes not nearly as charming as he was in mib nbranagh goes excessively over the top as the villain perhaps to the point where we cant even stand to look at him or his strange beard nand salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father but mostly she exists just for sexual attention nher acting is barely passable but what a breath of fresh ass ndirector barry sonnenfeld isnt of great help either neven though he shows some good creativity at some points his overall urgency for directing is lost nits as if he feels hes directing a tv movie a big nono when youre helming whats supposed to be a bigscreen hit nlast but not least there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable nat one point smith defies gravity when first boarding klines train nhe jumps on the back gets launched straight up in the air and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train while its still in motion nalso he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks nlast but not least why is he still making kissing faces when he knows hes not kissing a woman as hes looking through a peephole at the enemy nthe only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects nthe huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show ntheres also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades but again a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity ni would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west but it really isnt possible nif the racist and sex jokes dont bother you the performances will nif the performances dont bother you the story will nif the story doesnt bother you the racist and sex jokes will ntheres no end to the vicious circle ngo rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats nyoull have a better time nif you do go keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant ni bet he wishes he were somewhere else n

remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage n pulp fiction and fargo both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture and not surprisingly a slew of ripoffs followed in the years thereafter nthat fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing the way of the gun that at first glance looks like another of those wannabes but upon closer inspection doesnt look like anything comprehendable nits a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere a film that wont allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous ncomplexity should come as no surprise to anyone whos familiar with mcquarrie he wrote the usual suspects which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim nthat film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings nyou have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that if its really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating nwith the way of the gun mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea but this time the story is far less commercial a shame because maybe that would have helped nthe film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but arent hellbent on death either played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro nthey get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a bigshot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization nthey figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother played by juliette lewis and get a nice ransom nalong the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec his wife their hired goons and the bag man played by james caan the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what hes doing nthe exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously cant call the authorities for help nhis goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers trail and each make different offers to get the mother back nthe execs son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right nmeanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the doublecrosses secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all nmcquarrie doesnt know the meaning of the word simple nhe seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie neverything has to be complicated and confusing so much so that its to the point of surrealism nnothing is what it seems in this reality its one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industrys rules and regulations nevery scene with caans character exemplifies this perfectly the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him getting into conversations about the business and how it works and were hardly given a clue as to what theyre talking about nthese characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but theyre more like ideas rippedoff from sketches found in david mamets trash nno one here really acts like a real person and the story is even further removed from reality nits like a dream without any appeal ntake the opening scene for example the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff nthey sit on a brandnew mercedes and the car alarm goes off the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they dont move nthe guy and his loudmouth pottymouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them nyoud think phillipe and del toro are going to pull out guns and scare them away but they dont instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob ntheres a lot of things i didnt understand about this scene first of all the owner of the mercedes isnt some yuppie or old rich snob hes like a hippie straight out of the 60s nsecondly the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed nlastly it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small countrys army nif they were suicidal they wouldnt have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place and where they get all those guns is never explained either ntheres a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility nwhat it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is nabsolutely none of the characters are likable or believable nand its all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flatout black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time nwith any film you see whether you like it or not you can at least understand what the appeal was to it why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it ni cant say either for the way of the gun because it has very little going for it and i cant imagine anyone intelligently defending it n

 party camp is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies ive seen in awhile na late ripoff of the meatballs series the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk nthats really about all that can be said about the plot because nothing much happens except that the main character wisecracking jerry andrew ross has the hots for a cute blonde kerry brennan and there is a big contest in the climax nhow fun nsince party camp has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative nits not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex neven a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick nat least then it wouldnt have been such a chore to sit through nnever before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat nthe comedy was easy to spot but it wasnt the least bit funny nit was groaninducing nconstantly throghout i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything nso what saves party camp from the dreaded zero star rating nwell thats simple jewel shepard as a flighty bimbo was admittedly fun to watch nalthough nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash at least if the film had centered on shepard she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid lowbudget teen comedy n

star wars episode i the phantom menace 1999 ndirector george lucas cast liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman jake lloyd ian mcdiarmid samuel l jackson oliver ford davies terence stamp pernilla august frank oz ahmed best kenny baker anthony daniels screenplay george lucas producers rick mccallum runtime 131 min nus distribution 20th century fox rated pg mild violence thematic elements ncopyright 1999 nathaniel r atcheson na fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review nive attempted to obey this rule in recent months but to do so would be impossible in this case nthe fact is nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them nthe original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people nfor me they calibrated my creativity as a child they are masterful original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time and they still hold up pretty darn well ni am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release but that doesnt make me any less dedicated to it non the contrary the star wars trilogy and the empire strikes back in particular are three items on a very short list of why i love movies nwhen i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the ninefilm series i got exited nwhen i first saw screenshots from the film well over a year ago i embarked on a yearlong drool of anticipation nand when the first previews were released last thanksgiving i was ready to see the film nbut then there was the hype the insane marketing campaign and lucasfilms secretive snobbery over the picture nin the last weeks before the picture opened while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater i was tired of hearing about it ni was tired of seeing cardboard cutouts of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell ni just wanted to see the movie nreader do not misunderstand ni did not have an antihype reaction nthe hype was unavoidable ni understand and accept the hype its just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released nfive minutes into the phantom menace i knew there was a problem n who are these jedi knights ni asked n why are they churning out stale dialogue with machinegun rapidity n why arent these characters being developed before their adventures n why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film nthese were just some of my questions early on nlater i asked wheres the magic of the first three films nand why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes nby the end of the film i was tired maddened and depressed ngeorge lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless mindless summer blockbuster nthe phantom menace is no star wars film ntake away the title and the jedi talk and the force and youre left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time nits an embarrassment ni looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored or a new theme is examined or a special effects shot isnt used nthere are a few of each but theyre all token attempts nthe fact is george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects nthis is not what i wanted to see ni didnt want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth but i did nthe story centers mostly around quigon jinn liam neeson looking lost and confused and his apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor who scarcely has a line in the film and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo nnaboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation their contact on naboo is queen amidala natalie portman the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people nafter picking up jar jar binks a completely cgi character voiced by ahmed best they head to tatooine where they meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his mother pernilla august nquigon knows that the force is strong with young anakin and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys nthe bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters nthere isnt anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form nthe way lucas has handled it however it unsatisfactory nfirst of all we dont learn one single thing about quigon jinn nnot one thing nwhat was his life like before this film nwell i imagine he didnt have one nthats why he feels like a plot device nthis probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role and why hes recently retired from film i dont blame him honestly nobiwan a character i was really looking forward to learning more about is even less interesting nmcgregor has just a few lines so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere nsince these two men are the focus of the phantom menace lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie nthings start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshedout character in the film and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role ni was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting nand when anakin says goodbye to his mother i found it moving nalso fairly good is portman and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written njar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters ive ever had to endure but hes more interesting than most of the humans nas soon as the relativelybrief segment on tatooine is over its back to the mindnumbing special effects and depthless action scenes nive seen many movies that qualify as special effects extravaganzas but the phantom menace is the first one ive seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie nthe reason is obvious george lucas has no restraint ni cant say that i didnt find the effects original because i did the final battle between darth maul obiwan and quigon is visually exceptional as is most of the film nbut i also found the effects deadening and tiresome nmy breaking point was near the end of the picture as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters in the background we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky and i wanted that to go away ncant we have one stinking scene that isnt bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ni got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours nand then theres the question of magic nwhat was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ni have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel njohn williams familiar score is no help nor is lucas direction ni think it comes right down to characters there are none here ni longed for the magnetic presence of han luke and leia but i got no such thing nand what about the ridiculous expectations nmine werent that high i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects ninstead i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show ni dont hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it id like to forget that it exists and yet i cant nits here to stay ni can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them because if they dont then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series n
 practical magic is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and highprofile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing claptrap like this one nthe film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches spanning back 200 years nat the start their parents die when they are still children and they go to live with their two zany aunts stockard channing and dianne wiest nswitch to the present day gillian who is the stronger more rebellious sibling leaves home and meets up with a dark abusive guy goran visjnic while sally stays in their hometown meets and falls in love with a sweet caring man has two children and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed come to think of it shes not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes nwhen gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic they accidentally murder him and in desperation bury the body in the backyard of their aunts house nadd to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism not to mention a spattering of lighthearted whimsy and you have a pretty good idea how messy practical magic is nafter seeing the film i reflected that there was not even one scene or element that i liked or enjoyed nit is a comedy to be sure but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching nit is not charming or entertaining in any way nand then to top it off weve got this dark but birdbrained story of an evil spirit taking over gillians body nwhatever nthe characters are handled terribly and actually most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character nthere is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film and in every scene involving them they are always standing sidebyside nno attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people nthe same goes for aidan quinn as a handsome police investigator who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock even though he comes into it at around the 70minute mark and once again there is no attempt to develop their relationship or his character in any way nin fact every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along rather than getting to know the people saying the lines ni should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman who managed to destroy the batman series with batman forever and batman and robin n practical magic is directed by griffin dunne primarily an actor who last year made the contrived clumsy romance addicted to love with meg ryan and matthew broderick ni disliked that movie quite a bit but since practical magic is even worse that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is nid tell him to quit while hes ahead but in these last two years hes ultimately already buried himself n
if i were to plot a graph of year against movieplotridiculity for hollywood movies youll probably see a line with constant gradient n now if i were to plot that same graph for the movies that the michael bayjerry bruckheimer has made over the last 4 years that line would be exponential in growth nthe team started out with the will smith vehicle bad boys which was no more than a 2hr long actionmusicvideo nevertheless entertaining nthen came the rock where audiences flocked to see nicholas cage team up with sean connery against some terrorizing general fighting over some stupid cause nconair was ridiculousy dumb in its premise but it did have fun moments and who can forget the nursery rhyme sang by that psycho killer played by steve buscemi nwhile these movies worked because there was something better to coverup the dirt armageddon does not nvery much like deep impact a meteor is heading towards earth and they didnt realize it until 18 days from impact ndeep impact settled with the modest meteor size as large as the city of new york but armageddon just had to be bigger well nabout the size of texas that kinda meteor whould probably knock earth out of its orbit nthe panic of this sighting spurs the idea of landing people on the meteor drill it then nuke it sounds familiar and who better to do such a job than harry stamper bruce willis your very own oildriller extraordinaire and his team of machomisfits nursing the tagline there aint nothin on this planet that harry cant drill nin that 18 days harrys group was split into 2 teams trained for deepspace flight and finally blasted into space in with special drilling vehicles on 2 new space shuttles nthe main relationship drama of armageddon is formed within the relationship of harry a j nand grace nto give you an idea a j nworks for harry and loves grace harrys daughter nthe problem is harry hates to see his daughter hanging around some scruffy grunt like himself for the rest of her life nso while a j nand harry struts it out grace is place in a position where she is unable to take sides so she remains seated in the nasa control tower crying over both of them in about 80 of the movie nthe human elements this movie tries to inject proves to be nothing more than just an excuse for more slowmos and goldtinted photography nthe anguish of the world is potrayed with scenes of people praying running for their lives or just sitting still staring at the sky sounds fine right ni know but it looks too out of place on screen too staged nif you were to ask yourself whats the difference between armageddon and a rb music video nyoud probably just said the music nnot surprising since michael bay is a child of that industry and has actually managed to transpose his mtv skills to screen successfully nhis foray into armageddon just proves that he doesnt when to stop nwell theres really nothing much to sum up here nthe stockaitkenwaterman of hollywood movies have projected their artform into ridiculity beyond the plane believability where people still accept even if they didnt believe ndeep impact was ridiculous in most aspects and i believe the makers know this nthe thing is they decided to shroud myth and fantasy with a purely believable human tale of suffering and coming in terms with ones problems which ultimately brought it above the ashes which it had initially put itself in n armageddon is an overcrowded loud messy preposterously manipulative waste of money and deserves to remain in that same pile of ash 20 nif you have planned to watched this over deep impact because of liv tyler bruce willis or the tagline from the makers of the rock n please catch deep impact before it finishes its run it may be the only meteor worth watching in longlong time nif you have to see it please bring earplugs and some aspirins for the vertigo nexpect armageddon lds to retail at s19 90 at carrefour come release time ngee even n thats not worth it n

this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled bluecollar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times nit is hard to tell what is independent about this film it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam nit is the debut film for the director who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s where the mindset of all the characters depicted is grounded but to see it in the 1990s is a different story it is old news nthe love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesnt mean much since their relationship remained undeveloped nthe introduction of the wiseguy angle and the loyality among buddies bit are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tourdeforce performance by the star of the film adrien brody as ray nray is the only son of a lowlevel mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield new jersey suburban basement nray sr vincent is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale homerepair business nhis son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his longtime waitress girlfriend joanne sybil nthe title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman10b which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film you nshould be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that dont make sense its constant brainless chatter between the buddies their uneventful growing pains and the despair of their lives make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them ndesperate to make his dream come through ray goes to a loanshark humorously and menacingly played by james e moriarty and borrows 10 grand to bet on a sure thing at freehold raceway nthe horse loses and now ray has big problems as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough nthere is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray nhe is undependable meanspirited and stupid nso when his best friend mike gallagher the narrator of the film gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriendwho cares nthe director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do nas for rays gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen nhis buddies the college student mike and the dependable butchie gillan and his old man who he has this lovehate relationship with rally to his aid nand the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together nthere was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star nbecause of his intensity and looks he reminds me of sean penn n
in the finale of disneys mighty joe young a 15foot tall 2000pound gorilla holds a frightened young boy in its clutches as it topples from a crippled ferris wheel and plummets to the ground nupon impact rugged everyman and perennial dogooder bill paxton rushes in containing the emotional crowd with an earnest move along now folks theres nothing to see here nok so those arent exactly the words he uses but its probably one of the few clich s not uttered in this unnecessary remake of an unnecessary remake of that mother of all monster movies king kong n1949s mighty joe young was an update of that classic creature feature also based on merian c coopers original story 16 years after kong it appeared the world was ready for a new take on the beauty and the beast fable nnow some 49 years later at least according to disneys way of thinking the world is ready for one more nnot so nthe onlyand i mean onlyreason to see the 1998 version is for the special effects nand these unfortunately run hot and cold ntodays joe young is designed and produced by specialeffects whiz rick baker who has been wowing audiences with his stateoftheart makeup effects since 1971s schlock which incidentally featured a bakerenhanced gorilla njoe is a combination of animatronic effects computer graphics and that old standard a man in a monkey suit nwhile there are occasional flashes of brilliancebakers had a lot of practice with simian effects after all including gorillas in the mist greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes and the 1976 remake of king kong theres also some surprising cheesiness none of the films most embarrassing moments is when paxtons band of african trackers first encounter and pursue the largerthanlife primate in a scene unashamedly ripped off from the lost world jurassic park npaxton jubilantly extols the beasts majestic gait at the same exact moment as joe and the computer effects driving him stutter to a halt nalso if the films producers had wanted us to focus our attentions on the titular ape they shouldnt have paraded female lead charlize theron trial error around in a seeminglyendless wardrobe of spaghettistrapped tops neven joe seems distracted at times nthe film piles on the clich s like theres no tomorrow including the predictable plot anthrozoologists ship gigantic gorilla to l a where urban havoc is inevitably wrought predictable villain a lithuanian i think i overheard someplace predictable love story bill and charlizesurprise and predictable denouement twas boxoffice receipts that killed the beast nkids raised on men in black nonmonkey effects also by baker are going to find ron tremors underwoods outing a little lame by comparison nwhile certainly better than 1978s king kong lives itself a lousy sequel to a not particularly good remake mighty joe young proves how the mighty keep falling n
the best thing about lake placid is that its only 80 minutes long and when its over youre glad that you didnt waste more than an hour and a half of your time nits nothing more than a bad ripoff of jaws and i think thats being kind nit was written by david e kelly ally mcbeal as a horrorcomedy but fails at both miserably ni was never scared and i think that i only laughed once nthe crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in anaconda nthe plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine nthat brings the local sheriff brendan gleeson and a fishandgame warden bill pulman to investigate nalso a paleontologist bridget fonda from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionairecrocodile lover oliver platt flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast nsoon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it ntheres also an eccentric old lady betty white who lives by the lake and has a few secrets nas i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor h20 dont go for a serious approach towards the material but they also dont have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either nthe betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting theyre all basically idiots nif they had any brains the croc wouldnt have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldnt have put themselves in half of the situations that they did nbut then again if they were smart there wouldnt be a movie nbasically lake placid is best undiscovered n
okay i just dont know why but i seem to be getting this diversion to disneymade reallife actors movies as nwell as reallife acting tim allen movies ni couldnt even make it through the santa clause so why did i even see this n just to make an idle point i did like toy story but that was good also i have this aversion to bad french farces and if they remake them into american films nwell this is my excuse it was prom night im not a prom person my best friend and i impulsively went to the driveins where they were playing grosse pointe blank wouldnt mind seeing it again but i had to suffer through this first ni agreed to go nugh nin all fairness i can say that at least this inane plot wasnt dreamed by an american nit was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of little indian big city french title un indien dans la ville ni stayed away from it like it was limburgher and according to roger ebert that was a good idea nbut i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement nthe stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his current marriage nlet me clarify his wife jobeth williams left him years ago and i mean years around 13 or so and went to an island in the carribean or something nhe goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this thing n played with an emphasis on overdone by lolita davidovitch who is usually good nshe tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off nhe meets him he has a weird name mimi seku i think or nas the bad joke goes mitsubishi laugh track cue he knows english they fish more bad jokes pirhanna joke the kid has a pet spider he makes a promise to take him to the statue of liberty you nknow the drill nnow this is where the plot complicates well complicates for this one at least the fishoutofwater joke switches from tim allen on an island to his island son in new york city ntim is a stock broker and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasnt able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is martin short na russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere how come in every hokey french import there is a mob ntim learns a lesson of life from his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries nthe story is crap the jokes are hokey and not really funny and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting nbut the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldnt help it nthe whole time i kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up and several more grown people had to do this nat the end of filming did they all scream out weve made a great movie guys ni sure hope not nbig question to get from this film why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if theyre just going to do it the exact same way nhuh nmy for some of the actors names and a joke or two that made me chuckle i guess okay nso i really feel bad for it so i only gave it one star n
for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking or whats left of it in mainstream hollywood movie which are star vehicles are terrible things nas a rule the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor nan actor might be chosen on the upandup to give him exposure or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck ngenerally though the actor doesnt matter and soldier the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers exemplifies this the picture lacks pizazz nthe star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less nrussell plays todd a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought nthe movie lets us see this degenerate process but by the time the real plot starts were into todds later years nhes about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers ones who instead of being trained from birth are genetically selected before birth nthe pride of this class caine 607 jason scott lee will be our villain and you know hes the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movies start nbetween the two leads less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken and its possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction ndirector paul anderson who helmed last years icy thriller event horizon doesnt show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam ntodd upon being replaced is left to die on a garbage planet but in order to stretch the running time out the villains return to the garbage planet on a routine patrol and set the stage for the final firefight nevents are predictable from the time that the setups are made and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here nthe most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be todd fails to show physical superiority against caine in fact not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry nits not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it nthe best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit and treat it as a parody of typical action fare like universal soldier na strict interpretation however reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style class or substance and by next year a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television n
the sequel to the fugitive 1993 u s marshals is an average thriller using its association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks ntommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive nthis time hes after fugitive mark sheridan snipes who the police think killed two fbi agents but of course hes been set up and when the police plane escort he and gerard are riding crashes he makes a run for it gerard not so hot on his tail nwhat follows is about 2 hours of action brought to us by the director of executive decision 1995 another film curiously involving a plane nwhen comparing this movie to the fugitive the prequel is far superior nbut even on its own u s marshals is a pretty lousy movie nwhile the original was reasonably intelligent and had a fugitive to root for the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive mainly because we know so little about him until way into the films overlong running time nwhile the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character u s marshals is straight in there pulling its trump card the place crash almost immediately nto be honest i couldnt care less if snipes character got captured or not nsnipes performance is average and his character gets surprisingly little screen time considering he is the fugitive for reasons ill explain later ntommy lee jones is as fine as ever although his role is hardly a challenge nthe sense of deja vu was overwhelming ni know its the same role from the fugitive but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film ntheres a few nudge nudge references from the first film but apart from that nothing nnobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie ndowney jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce whos roped into the chase and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife nnobody looks as if their having a good time and all the performers are on autopilot nthe supporting cast are o k but when it comes to performances u s marshals falls flat on its face nit doesnt fare any better plotwise either nthe film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes but then veers off into terrorists territory nas said above the film is an normal average terrorist thriller seen a million times before but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional nif this film wasnt the sequel to the fugitive this would probably go straight to video or not even been made at all because its so average nand because of the films plot changing its course snipes is almost forgotten apart and hardly features in the movie nstuart baird the director is all right but theres no particular scene that stands out nits director is the usual action movie style neven the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension nthe special effects are nice especially the plane crash and theres a good if very loud soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith nbut in the end u s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement nsure its loud and dumb but in the end u s marshals just aint fun nbored performers and a lackluster plot and script do not make a good action movie noverall rating review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities n
the yettobereleased krippendorfs tribe is being marketed as a family comedy but buyer beware nthis movie cant make up its mind nis it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies menstruation circumcision and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them nor is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort neither way unbalanced is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort nthe premise is catchy widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf richard dreyfuss has spent the past two years getting over the death of his wife neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses nnow its time to show what hes achieved in those two years and he has absolutely nothing to show for it nwith a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous 100 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonalds nbut when his discovery becomes the latest craze among colleagues the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe he must create it nwith the aid of his three children the headstrong teen shelly natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you the slightly younger mickey gregory smith and the nineyearold edmund carl michael lindner the shelmikedmu tribe named from the first half of each childs name is born and videos quickly produced in krippendorfs backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe ndespite the professors wishes the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows due in greatest part to veronica micelli jenna elfman an overly vivacious and voluptuous anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorfs main assistant nhungry for recognition micelli sets up interviews lectures etc in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history a sure fire way to go down in the history books nkrippendorf on the other hand is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor not in history books and with each new lecture he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe mating habits domestic structure etc thru fumbling improvisation and often some quick thinking from his oldest son krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe non the opposing end is krippendorfs arch rival ruth allen lily tomlin an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the nonexistent tribe nits a cute idea and approached with a more subtle and mature style krippendorfs tribe couldve been a real winner nsadly the mostlymisfired toilet humor overly comical musical score by bruce broughton and sugar coated sentiments all the key ingredients of a family comedy just arent the right tone for this film ncut that crap out add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and youve got a good start nat the state its in now youve got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs ndoubtfire meets dumb dumber and thats not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try nthe overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of average with a few laughoutloud moments and a great big gap in between them nmost of the characters are surprisingly twodimensional and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort lyonne seems to go greatly unappreciated ndirector todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways nits stuck in limbo between disney family fare jungle 2 jungle and potentially hilarious adult comedy a fish called wanda nits this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade and its a brutal drop na strong warning to parents forget the impression given by advertisements do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because shes holding his penis nyes its put that bluntly njust be warned this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film and others might not be as tame n
in gia angelina jolie plays the titular character the first socalled supermodel nand right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome in my eyes anyway ni just dont see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film ndespite this i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie nsadly though my fears were realized nits just not possible to make an interesting fulllength film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes nthe movie follows the rise and fall of gia no last name a tumultuous woman who doesnt particularly enjoy the world of fashion nshe becomes famous more quickly than she can handle and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have nthe last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high losing a job and going into rehab nthis formula is repeated several times and i really got tired of it nin general i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use nno because it offends me or anything like that it just bores me nquite frankly i dont see the appeal so when a director shows me a pointofview shot of a junkie complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices i am left somewhat unimpressed nthe first hour of the film though was actually quite engaging nwe see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend nthese early scenes were interesting nwere shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes and it was a perspective i hadnt seen before nthe movie begins to go downhill however once gia becomes an established model nfrom that point i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end nit all seemed so excessive nfine so gia had a drug problem does this really need to dominate the film ncouldnt the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs nor perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world nquite possibly although since i have no desire to become a model this warning is lost on me nas i stated at the beginning of this review i simply dont see how the life of a model is worthy of a featurelength motion picture nwhat do they do that warrants a movie nstrut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour ni suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players for example but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life ngia did not nand by the end of the film all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling was bisexual and was heavily into drugs nnot exactly a meaningful contribution to society as far as im concerned n

one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric youd better watch out for the skin deep nid like to extend the same warning watch out for skin deep but whatever you do dont watch skin deep nskin deep is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards njohn ritter stars as zach a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a bigtime drinking problem ni never saw edwards comedy the man who loved women but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake nyou see to put it mildly zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets nas the movie opens zachs wife alex catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress hairdresser nlike any sensible wife alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him nin response zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking womanizing psychotherapy and selfdiscovery nif youre turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink get arrested have sex drink crash his mercedes have more sex drink get arrested again drink and sing horrendously at the piano then skin deep should be right up your alley nskin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters nzach is a rich 80s l a version of ritters jack tripper character from threes company nlike jack zach is clumsy and inept hes the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye nzach is supposed to be charming and charismatic but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him nconsequently i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis nin fact when zach crashes his exwifes wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony nto add insult to injury edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work nfor instance vincent gardenias talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender nof all the women in the filmand there are manyalyson reed alone stands out as zachs wife reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role nbecause we dont care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep the films few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail nthe comedy in skin deep doesnt fare much better nmost of the jokes are dumb predictable and sitcomish nabout every ten minutes however edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sightgag the most effective of which involves a pair of dueling condoms noverall the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat nmy final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism nzachs excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain nzachs drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences nif he crashes his mercedes he gets a new one nif he gets arrested his lawyer bails him out of jail nif his wife leaves him she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if hell clean up his act nthe tone in skin deep is all wrong edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly making a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter nperhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or better yet michael keaton in clean and sober before making skin deep n
any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it nunfortunately this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible directed by brian depalma nthe first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever aside from the music nthe tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork orchestrated by jim phelps allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world nteamwork was the key nthis film is set up as a cross between james bond and depalmas blow out where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions nit was travoltas vulnerability that made that film so exciting and claustrophobic nin this film tom cruise is basically omniscient believe that and so theres no fun going on here whatsoever nthe story is about as contrived as contrived gets and is full of holes nthere are basically two memorable sequences one involves breaking into a kubrickesque computer room a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room the second involves a highspeed train a helicopter and the chunnel and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved nthe actors are all miscast especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife who cannot act and ving rhames as a computer hacker who looks lost and embarrased to be in this movie ntom cruise is no james bond and jon voight looks more like bobby the brain heenan than jim phelps nbrian depalmas career has been bafflingly erratic nat his best he beats hitchcock at his own game blow out carrie body double but this is not his best nthe screenplay was partly written by robert towne who wrote the best scenario of the seventies in chinatown but this script is perfunctory at best and terrrible at worst nthe cinematography has a comic book redblue emphasis which is nice to look at but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape trick nplease dont spend your money on this itll only encourage hollywood to make more n
if youve seen the trailers or commercials its rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store nwell its hard to tell after watching the movie as well nbruce willis is a resident of the future and it is a rather bleak future nthe worlds population had disintigrated into a mere 200 000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals nthe reason nin 1995 an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus thus wiping out practically the worlds population in a mere month nbruce willis character is one of the surviving few but is enslaved by scientists as are most of last living humans nthey barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task go into the past find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys and kill him nwell this explanation didnt come easy nalthough the movie is very thought provoking of us as a people our future and the evilo in the world as a story it is very confusing nand dragging ni know a movie isnt keeping my interest when i fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my watch only to find that its only been an hour passed nterry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate and i havent watched his previous work brazil but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out you wish it were more complex and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me n
it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller nsome people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others myself included would pick seven days in may nboth those films were tense exercises in chills nthe two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man john frankenheimer nbut that was 1962 and 1964 respectively nfor most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed neach of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot nthey had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay nthe thrills all came from the plot nronin is like a film made by another man nsomewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot but we see only tiny pieces of it nwe get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j d zeiks screenplay is a bit obscure nthe film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai nwhen a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death he becomes a ronin much like a gunfighter in the american west nif you miss the opening do not worry nthis film will explain again what a ronin is nsam played by robert de niro is the modern equivalent of a ronin nhe is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer nhe clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france nsam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre natascha mcelhone of the truman show an irish woman to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case ndierdre is very tightlipped about what is in the case nsam joins a team of four others vincent jean reno of the professionalleon and mission impossible spence sean bean tvs richard sharpe and also patriot games and goldeneye and gregor stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting nalso along is larry skipp suddeth nthe group seems to know their business particularly sam but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise ntheir only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team nthe story is not very easy to follow nit is never clear who is doublecrossing whom and who is working for whom nsomehow russians who may or may not be the russian mafia and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case nsome very good actors are involved in this film none wonders what they saw in the script nthe characters are mostly onedimensional professional killers nthey know their work and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed nby the end of the film we never really got to know anybody nmaybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts since these are not very demanding characters to create nin addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal nas a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy nunfortunately there are no deep characters and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it ni rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale nnonspoiler incidentally the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin nalso one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet nthis is the first blow of the 47 ronin n
it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of its stars roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 nmcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films nfright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles nthis is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was nwilliam ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us n at least in the movies anyway nit has been several years since charlie brewster ragsdale and bmovie actor turned late night horror film host peter vincent mcdowall came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlies next door neighbor ncharlie and peter won that battle but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family napparently charlies former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling nso she decides to exact a little bit of revenge nthis ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again none of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlies stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood nfright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort nwhile they are stylish the vamps in this film just dont have the personality of the undead in the first film nwith the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes none bright spot speaking from a strictly sexist point of view is traci lin who plays charlies very skeptical girlfriend nits really a shame that her career hasnt been better since she made this film nragsdale does a fair job in this film but doesnt give nearly the performance that he did in the original nroddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given which unfortunately isnt much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie ni guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way nthe original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner part 2 had more of the feel of a music video nnever a good thing for a horror film nanother minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare nfor that matter they were almost nonexistent nif i was going to watch a horror film this would be far from my first choice nthe first fright night on the other hand would be right up near the top of my list nif i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film id probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes neither way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation n
filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull dreary and overused idea ndoug liman swingers director of the ultrahip and severely dark comedy go is an example of just such a filmmaker nin his latest he gives the viewers a raucous neonlit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a druginfested path of misadventure as director nbut he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multitiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same nhis movie is produced anthologystyle telling the same story from multiple three points of view much as an author might write a serial novel nconsistent with this ethic liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives nthe thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter nin story a we have checkout clerk ronna sarah polley looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it in story b we have regular drug dealer simon desmond askew gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity and in story c we have gay soap actors zack jay mohr and adam scott wolf working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal nneither of the three stories have much substance and the movie has the feel of a campfire story albeit a rather strange one that could be told in five to ten minutes n in fact the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length nthe early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movies christmas setting and the los angeleslas vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theatergoers to attach themselves to nthe characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite and performances from littleknown players like polley askew and taye diggs dont help or hurt the roles nin fact even bigger names like mohr wolf and katie holmes dont have enough time to make substantial success nalthough thats almost expected for lack of continuous screen time the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories ngo doesnt have this and it suffers because of it nas far as teen movies are concerned go represents the absolute bottom for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme n the following do not count as common themes drug deals people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them nat times the humor in go is sickly funny and on a low night almost watchable but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night n
a film that means well but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama nits jeroen krabb s melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who cant forget their bitter past nthe heroine is an attractive carefree nonreligious 20yearold chaja fraser who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations screwing a student rebel leader and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother s gebrecht and her selfabsorbed eccentric father schell nher parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps and her home life is filled with angst nher mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos a family album silverware and his old violin nhe buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis but cant locate them now due to all the changes in the city nout of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents apartment building mr apfelschnitt topol tells her about nthe hasidics are ultraorthodox they dont go to the cinema or watch tv adhere to strict dress codes and strictly observe their religious laws nchaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules but soon finds the wife mrs kalman rossellini to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children a 4yearold named simcha monty who doesnt talk nthe stern mr kalman krabb is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses nto hammer home the point of how antisemitism hasnt gone away theres a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge bradley who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator nthe film is done in by its hamfisted script as the story adapted from carl friedmans book the shovel and the loom goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality nit starts off telling chajas story of how shes a lost jewess trying to find her identity then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that cant be forgotten nthe effort seemed heavyhanded as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters nthe supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring chajas parents are given no human shades while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was onedimensional and falsely acted nthe only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence but is strong in accepting her faith ntopols reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense nthe film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it cant love it starts out by showing how under chajas loving care hes taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away beginning by saying quack quack and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder nbut by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence refuses to speak because of his stern dad and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident the film thereby exploits the boys sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done ni felt i didnt just see a movie but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story nit was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarilythe message it keeps sending was already received nin the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past nthat seems strange since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about nunless i was mistaken and the films real aim was to make us cry over simcha n
unfortunately it doesnt get much more formulaic than one tough cop ntheres the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain nthe renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film nbo dietl pronounced deedle baldwin is one tough cop a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia non top of that problem he has a drunk gambling addicted partner penn who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets i guess cops arent immune nthen throw into the mix the femme fatale gershon nright there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama nbut right in the middle of the film they throw in a completely unrelated plot point ndietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from nthe film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death nonce the case is solved the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue nwhatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably naside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso an insult if you ask me the performances were pretty good nbaldwin though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec does a fine job as one tough cop npenn who also slips into an impression of his brother sean is even better as a loser tough guy cop nwhat one tough cop lacks is originality nthis film offers nothing new nnothing that you cant get from any cop film nit screams sidney lumet all over the place perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman producers of lumets dog day afternoon and serpico nbut even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film ntoo much else is lacking ni also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture something that i almost never notice nbut once i saw that i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot nat times i was hoping to see it none tough cop isnt laughable nor is it a terrible film but it just isnt unique nit is a classic example of a film that didnt need to be made nbut one thing is for sure it could really use a better title n

dr dolittle 20th century fox running time 1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor 1996 murphy returns in this abysmal comedy nhe plays doctor john dolittle who as a child had the ability to understand animals nhowever after being exorcised he loses this ability and we fast forward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people most notably dr mark weller played by oliver platt nhowever with a bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns and comedy is ready and waiting to happen nexcept comedy never does happen ndoctor dolittle even with the excellent premise rarely manages to raise a laugh npoor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie and his performance suffers nthe manic murphy we saw in the 80s is gone his more mature and more boring twin appears to be getting all the work in the 90s nthe voices of the animals which include albert brooks chris rock the new eddie murphy and norm mcdonald as lucky the dog are marginally better and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie nsadly most of their lines are pretty dumb nand theyre not funny dumb like dumb dumber 1994 but just boring dumb nthe film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through in a desperate attempt to raise some laughs nthere are a few good jokes in the script but they are few and far between nif i had to choose a favourite performance it would probably be albert brooks tiger who has a certain charm about him nsadly hes barely in the movie and rocks really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time njoke wise we are thankfully spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor nthe director betty thomas has well done better films nshe bought us private parts 1997 and the brady bunch movie 1995 which were sadly much better than this nthe scenes lack any charm she just gets the job done nthe animals themselves are reasonable realistic although most of them are obviously puppets ntheres an impressive looking tiger however and the lip sync is pretty good nyoud have no problem guessing that most of the close ups are puppets however with their jilted movement ni was hoping jim hensons workshop who created the furry friends would have done a better job ndoctor dolittle in the end is a disappointment for everyone involved nmurphy has done much better movies i e ntrading places the director has seen better days and even the creatures arent that good nthe target audience aged between 713 who are undemanding will probably like it however thanks to its dumbed down humour neveryone else however should give doctor dolittle a miss n

salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets nactors who demand such salaries might be greedy but in some instances they are quite justified because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation nproof for that can be found even in the realm of lowbudget movies and one fine example is breakaway 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring in famous figure skater tonya harding nface of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movies poster but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster none day she decides to retire but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that nrealising that her life suddenly became worthless myra starts running for her life followed by professional assassins nterri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater nalthough tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities her acting leaves much to be desired non the other hand her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave bfilms a bad name nmartin sheens brother joe estevez whose character looks like he had entered from another movies set is the only bright spot of breakaway nunfortunately he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya hardings silver screen debut proved to be her last film n
 love to kill starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes nat the outset the movie appears to be about tony danza whos an illegal distributor of guns trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman ndanza sets up a double date with her her sister and a collegue of his neverything seems to be going well until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs nmuch confusion and mahem ensues as the death is covered up and other associates of danzas begin to emerge all after one thing or another nsound confusing nit is ni think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity nin some respects it works nbut the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess ncharacters keep popping up with no explanation demanding money for deals that occur offscreen nthe only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead womans sister nbut so little time is devoted to this part of the story we never really become too familiar with these characters and because of this we dont really care what happens to them nwell i didnt at least none thing i will give the movie is that its a complete departure for tony danza nheres a guy because of his many sitcom roles whos ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing nhere he plays a man whos just looking out for himself and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin so be it ni was very impressed by his performance and within minutes of the start of the film i had forgotten all about his goodguy persona nmichael madsen is also good as an associate of danzas who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him nlike i said its not exactly a linear storyline n love to kill should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre but its just too bad that the story doesnt really add up to much nthe stars deserved better and so did the audience n
talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters nspice world is the feature film debut of the prefabricated pop band the spice girls nits intended as a sort of hard days night but ends up simply hard to watch nwhen watching the spice girls im reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick such as from the smurfs the snorks or teenage mutant ninja turtles in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name nthe spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles and about as talented ntheres ginger geri halliwell the brainy one sporty melanie chisholm the athletic one baby emma bunton the childish one posh victoria adams the fashionconscious one and scary melanie brown the one with a tongue pierced back so far youre almost certain the post sticks out her throat nthe film itself doesnt really have a plot nit follows the girls as they travel here and there culminating at their first live performance at albert hall nthe action however seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas nthe various misfires include an alien encounter a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls the shooting of a spice girls documentary a movie producer george wendt trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie nearly all of which though incredibly far fetched seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up a meeting with a pregnant friend whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends a boating adventure a bus race clubhopping wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd even nwhen they start to sing and an assorted number of musical performances press conferences and general allaround celebrity stuff nwhew nfor some reason the film is littered with star cameos nfrom elton john to elvis costello from bob hoskins to meat loaf nheck even roger moore shows up though he cant decide if hes parodying himself as james bond or if hes lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld nrichard e grant has the largest secondary part a thankless role of the bands manager clifford nthe celebrity spotting is partially amusing and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film nneither amusing or spontaneous when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring ntheir songs are alright but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos nmy advice to fans is stay home and watch that video collection or at least spin that cd a couple of more times either noption will be more enjoyable than the film nnonfans should know to stay well away from this one n
one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris odonnell stars in this remake of buster keatons 1925 silent film seven chances nnow ive never seen seven chances as im more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this nodonnell plays jimmie shannon the manager of a pool table manufacturing company nhe also fears commitment and despite dating anne renee zellweger for over three years hes unwilling to marry her nhis reasons nwell hes a guy you see and well guys are like stallions and they apparently dont like to be roped or something hey thats the movies explanation nid marry renee zellweger in a second neventually it comes time for jimmie to propose and when he does its the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever nhe essentially says to her you win and hands her a ring nthe audience should now hate this character ni did nthen the meat of the plot presents itself njimmies grandfather peter ustinov completely wasted dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business nhowever in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers jimmie must be married before his next birthday which is just over 24 hours away nhaving blown his chances with anne jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a business proposition nthe movie wasnt half bad by this time surprisingly nit wasnt boring me and even managed to read my thoughts at one point nustinovs character left a video will and while hes reading the ridiculous clause in it i thought to myself what is this brewsters millions nas soon as i thought it hal holbrooks character actually says what is this brewsters millions nit was quite surreal nsomething happens though during the films final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive nup to that point all of jimmies prior girlfriends had turned down his business proposition which i felt was good nat least the film wasnt painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers nwhen jimmie has no other options his goofy friend played by artie lange making a career out of playing the goofy friend places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story nat this point 100 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride nthese women arrive at jimmies location and immediately start bullying him about what hes looking for in a woman nwhen hes had enough of their unjustified attacks he tells the angry mob that theres been a mistake and he wont be marrying any of them nas a result the women proceed to chase him around the city in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off nthis goes on for the rest of the film nits just chris odonnell running from 100 000 obnoxious greedy angry and stupid women nmy groans of disgust could be heard for miles nthe film finally ended thankfully but to this day im still groaning nthe bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video nit contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 85 1 cast and crew info and special dvdrom features nthe original theatrical trailer is also on the disc which contains scenes not in the film napparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing odonnell around the city and at one point odonnell is leaping from the tops of buses nso that was bad enough to be cut but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good nugh n

everybody in this films thinking of alicia nno this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the cryin video nthis is one of those erotic thrillers but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed nfirst off theres zero sex almost no nudity and its not as wellplotted as one of those tweed flicks nwell anyway nthe plot nalicia plays well the babysitter who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents j t nwalsh and lee garlington go out to a party nthe film trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers shows every characters thoughts except alicias nthe thing is alicias in most of them in most cases and the thoughts arent too kosher nfirst off theres her boyfriend jeremy london who gave one of the alltime lousy performances in mallrats and is only a notch better here whos a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully played by nicky katt from suburbia who shows hes got that quiet creepiness down pat once again nthey decide they want to crash her babysitting job looking for the typical babysitting hankypanky nsomethine like that nthe film intercuts between the subplots alicia babysitting nicky and jeremy the party and each characters thoughts nwe get to see jeremy and nickys dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia j t nthinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub she has it all covered up the little tease and worst of all lee garlington dreaming of that hunk george segal nit even shows them in bed together nyea ni so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed though i guess im used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in flirting with disaster nthe ending is some kind of big tragedy thing but come on nlike we care about any of the characters nthe only interesting one is alicia mainly because shes alicia and we mostly see her in the fantasies nso i guess shes some kind of mystery or something nbut she is never explored further nso basically this film is just a series of mastabatory images sometimes featuring a nonnude alicia once again sadly sometimes featuring a scantilyclad george segal once again sadly ni watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night and let me tell you it is the only way to watch this film ni mean theres a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night theyre just as good as sleeping pills nand this one is one big fat waste of time even for an alicia film n
for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo the killer hard boiled face off appears to have made an exciting elegant charming spy thriller kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american read unsophisticated hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them nsadly as the picture progresses the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up twohour long episode of magyuver nand not a particularly good one at that nwhat went wrong nmi2 begins flashily enough that initial flash leading us to believe that itll soon give way to something of a plot but it only gives way to more flash then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruises firing gun just so they can die really cool nearly on during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt tom cruise and nyah nordoffhall thandie newton woo works some of his trademark magic nin one hypnotic though completely inexplicable sequence the director slows the action down to a languid semistall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and others eyes with come hither sexuality just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff nprior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain sans scaffolding then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another nwhy ni havent the foggiest ni doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply nwith mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects nits possible that these spies could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off though of course this is never explored nthe scenes ive described are really only included to titillate not to give any insight into character ngod forbid nwoo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commerciallike visuals nstill in terms of crackerjack eye candy the opening has much to cherish ncruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is nbetween the frantic dancing woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact nthe scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way yet it has style and something of soul and woo casts a bit of a spell on us nsure its all smoke and mirrors but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product nthandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene thats about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight nthey flirt and exchange obvious double entendres nnewton bats her eyes flirtatiously ncruise grins a little too slyly nthe cruise character ethan hunt has been drastically altered since the first film nhere cruise plays him more as a hip sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 nhes cool and dashing which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film and blustered his way through magnolia quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90s nsadly as the film progresses we see less of cruises initial im the man ncharm and more slomo closeups of his preening mug nmi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just wont stop nthe whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle the first gun fight in the film which really should be unheard of in a john woo film but alas this particular battle couldve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi of course excepting the symbolic pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture nweve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand nit isnt done any differently here nthe action is pure hard target broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind nhes cool for sure but hes made to be as empty as the movie nthe actor isnt used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment be it during a gunfight before one or after one nwhen hes not beaming away hes staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell but woos editing seriously undermines the effort nhe fetishizes cruises angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof ni half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that hes really austin powers nin a classic woo action moment ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pinup boy angel of death nthe gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does nthe lead bad guy played by the appropriately british dougray scott and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken on motorcycles nthough instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug only to fly about a hundred feet still in bear hug position land on a beach below and begin a manoemano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a so you thought i was dead nnot to worry cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat nwhat a hero nyou may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2s plot nmy reasoning is simple im not sure of any good it would do nthe film itself has absolutely no concern with story only with hurtling forth to the next special effect ni wasnt kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video nnobody will go to this for the plot and if they do theyll surely regret it nas summer movies evolve or devolve character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing nin mi the plot seemed to be built around brian de palmas that films director stylistic flourishes while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woos nonstop masturbatory pandemonium nits irrelevant in every sense as is character nall that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors n
numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past scifi suspense thrillers nsoldier is a multi crossbreed between the likes of terminator aliens and offspring nthe problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground nbesides this the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age nthe fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured slow and sluggish and could have done with better choreography nrussell who is usually a good actor in bgrade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character sergeant todd who seems more like a sergeant toad nbesides having almost no dialogue his character appears stunted zombielike which is in line with his screen persona but scores little points of empathy with the audience nthis movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth nalthough this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former it is still a long way from anything considered desirable n
synopsis wealthy cuban landowner luis banderas gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride nnot only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia jolie she also harbours a secret past of dubious merit nsoon julia has absconded with both luis fortune and his heart and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld luis begins to realise that for him there is no turning back nreview given the absurdism of its wouldbe plot its unlikely that original sin could have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking regardless of writer director or stars nthis is at its heart bmovie junk a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions nthat said original sin could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it ninstead cristofer seems to have mistaken this for a serious production and directs it as such nthe result is a vapid uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill nconsider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie brightlylit and mostly filmed from above it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show ncristofer doesnt even manage to capture the allure of cuba instead of portraying his setting as a steamy sensuous island paradise it appears bland and lifeless nat least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script but arent being given the chance nthe same cannot be said of jane whose billy is nebbish and transparent nalso unwise is the jolie framing sequence which practically gives away the films denouement n
when i ponder childhood memories past one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the inspector gadget tv show with my older brother ntruth be told we were rabid fanatics our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr claw the inspectors arch nemesis ni was never a biggie on nostalgia but you just cant help but have fond memories of something like that nsometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching reruns of my favorite episodes trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid nat the very least i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me ndespite how horrid a film may be the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up nso back i sat with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver lets face it exactly how good can a liveaction disney film really be ni was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr magoo and george of the jungle two previous disney adaptations and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well nrarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness nas everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind i was left sitting there absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen ncan something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world nright from the beginning i knew i was in trouble nin the opening scenes each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be to simply serve as reallife duplicates of their cartoon clones nwhen referring to them people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be oh hi penny nis brain with you ncreating onedimensional replicas is one thing having mere names take the place of them is quite another nthe plot shall we call it stays fairly in tune with the original series nmatthew broderick stars as john brown how creative is that na security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex why rupert everett for the love of god why who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events nbrown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new lawenforcement technology wherein hes joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form drumroll please ninspector gadget nfrom here on out the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations although to be fair my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind ntheres something about an evil gadget taking over the city his first crime must have been swiping matt dillons dentures from theres something about mary and it all ends with what else a bunch of postcredit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself nto be honest i wasnt much paying attention to these treats ni was just glad that it was over n

maybe this mission should have been scrubbed nmission to mars na film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman ntheres a world of difference between artists and technicians nthe artist has a vision to create something new nhe may not do it well it might be sloppy but its something youve never seen before na good technician can make it look good but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else its going to be just a xerox nobviously successful films need both skills nbrian de palma is a masterful technician nhes spent his career copying others most notably hitchcock nhe usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work but only because he has learned it by rote naside from rare flashes of originality his films are often souldead nin de palmas latest he turns his attention to stanley kubrick nto tell the truth i enjoyed portions of this movie but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called 2001 ni enjoyed it even more when it was titled close encounters nnasa has set its sights for mars nwhen the first crew meets with disaster a rescue mission is sent to the red planet nthey dont do so well either but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronautgonerasta and solve the mysteries of the universe nand its all so boring nthere are so many scenes that just dont work its difficult to begin nwhen the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upsidedown martian tornado which looks remarkably like a sandworm from dune destroying everything in its path they just hang out watching nerror nthe most interesting character and thats not saying much is killed off nerror nthe alien is laughable nerror nthe rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable nerror ntheres some nice eyecandy nthe face on mars which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head looks cool na threedimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world nmaneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic nbut theres so much more that feels as if weve been there before nfrom 2001 theres the rotating space station the blinding white room nfrom close encounters they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens nthe list goes on nthe actors are mostly mobile wooden statues neven gary sinise and tim robbins cant muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing nno one seems to care about anything that happens nyou wont either nthe absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr pepper with a 20 foot tall logo saves the day nthey should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film n
 showgirls is the first bigbudget bigstudio film to receive an nc17 rating nand its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence nbut if showgirls is any indication of hollywoods future the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american valuesbad moviemaking n showgirls is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter ndirector paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas who collaborated on another shockvalue project 1992s basic instinct follow the plight of a young woman teen tv star elizabeth berkley determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer nits a hackneyed premise to begin with so not surprisingly all of the stock characters are trucked out ntheres the demanding producer nthe loyal friend nthe bitchy competitor nlest i forget the scummy club owner nof course any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the films main attractionan endless parade of fullfrontal nudity nunfortunately showgirls doesnt satisfy in this department nverhoevens slambang inyourface style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic nto make matters worse youll be forced to sit through the movies clothed scenes which dont cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history nverhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground but if its adult entertainment you want stay home and watch the playboy channel nyoull be the wiser for it n
the swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a very tim burton movie but alas no caped crusader descends to save this film ninstead its a skeletal housemaid julia roberts who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of dr njekyll and mr hyde nfor a few fleeting maddening moments director stephen frears dangerous liaisons gets everything just right the tone the colors the characters all the ingredients to make a mostpowerful potion out of valerie martins bestselling novel nyet it fizzles too quickly the volatile mixture losing potency from the very first scene ncasting is a large part of the problem nthe story all but collap ses around ms roberts she doesnt have the range for this kind of drama nher accent also comes and goes though its nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemistry between her and costar john malkovich n he looks the same in both of his roles an incredible fact thats missed by everyone in the story nthe very british supporting cast including michael gambon and george cole gives credibility to the smaller parts nglenn close also appears as a madam that the good doctor calls upon nher performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets and as a bonus offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the liveaction 101 dalmantions nthe biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense there is none nno terror no tension nothing nwithout any weight wit or wonder to propel the story the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail a few buckets of blood and stuart craigs fabulously dreary production design nall of which gets old after about an hour at which point i recommend leaving n the pacing in the secondhalf is especially abominable nif you do stick it through your sole reward is a halfhokey special effect depicting the infamous transformation nmr frears reportedly recut his film several times missing several release dates in the process n obviously no one advised him to throw up his hands and just turn the whole damned thing over to mel brooks nblucher nmary reilly is the second robert louis stevenson story of the month after muppet treasure island nperhaps mr frears should consult with brian henson on future projects ni daresay that even ms piggy is a better choice for a certain roles than julia roberts nand she does have a great chop n
this is an adaptation of h g wells acclaimed novel the invisible man nthe actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue nthe director is paul verhoven nthat plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer should be enough to lure us into the theatre nthe problem is to keep us there ni cant imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time nworking on a top secret military project sebastian caine kevin beacon an eccentric genius that calls himself god has discovered the secret to invisibility nthe first two faces are completed nnow it is time for the next logical step human ncaine volunteers for this risky experiment nbut when he is made invisible something goes wrong nwhile his exgirlfriend linda elisabeth shue desperately tries to find something to return him to normal he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower nbut thats not the bad thing an unexpected sideeffect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania nhe is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine nsoon every sense of decency is forgotten nthe little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alienripoff where caine is walking like a half finished terminator spooking scaring and killing everybody nthough its based on a novel called the invisible man the title has been ironically changed to hollow man that sums up the film very nicely nthis is a very silly production nlaughable actually napparently verhovens imagination doesnt stretch too far nfor him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls locker room undetected nit is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie nbeing invisible gives you the opportunity to be who you are to do what you want without being influenced by society nin many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences nthe nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about nall that the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat ncaine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man nbut since this is a modernization in other words a dehumanization he doesnt stop there nhe becomes a rapist nand then of course a murderer nyoull start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place nshues talent is barely seen josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent nkevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully nhis face is not seen for the most part of the film and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice nthere are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing nin the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place nbeing probably the best technical achievement since jurassic park they are absolutely amazing nwe observe the layers of skin muscle tissue and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible nwe see a beating heart inflating lungs and veins pulsing with newlypumped blood nthere are a couple of inventive shots with smoke fire air and water but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for nwhat is truly disturbing is that with a great book talented actors and a grand budget this could have been so much more npretty much like jan de bont twister haunting paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary nhe was responsible for several good films basic instinct and starship troopers and some incredibly bad films showgirls total recall but he has never made anything that was great nin a way hollow man fits perfectly in this collection nits not better or worse than verhovens average film nhe proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues nand so instead of depth and chills verhoven inserts some of his trademarks stupid dialogue and lots of dull action with blood and naked bodies nhe even throws in some of the worst of film clich s the slowly advancing fireball the villain who comes back from the dead etc etc and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year youll be screaming nooooo nand attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion nand all we can ask is why nthe answer is simple nthough hollywood is a movie producing machine the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money nit has to be about telling stories not marketing them nit has to be about transporting us to a different place to dazzle us with magic and cleverness nto make us care to make us think and feel nverhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that nits all flesh and bones but no soul na void where its imagination should be n
the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows jane march was very cute as jane and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length nif you havent already figured it out i didnt like this movie very much nthe plot was boring and contrived to the extreme ntarzan casper van dien has now left the jungle and living in civilized society nhe is just days away from his impending marriage to jane played by the aptly named jane march nback in his former home of africa a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city n mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city nanyway tarzans old jungle friend appears to him in a vision ntarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city nhe leaves jane his first mistake in my opinion and travels to africa nof course jane is hot on her ape mans heals nthe two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys nsound like a dumb explanation of the plot nits actually an improvement over the real thing nthe acting is just plain awful nim not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film but it wasnt acting njane march wasnt a heck of a lot better but at least she is easy on the eyes ncompounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been rerecorded and ive seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies nadded to the sound problems was the cinematography nthis film was filled with beautiful african scenery nbut the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me nquite frankly i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment nthen we have the special effects n special effects in a tarzan movie nyou are no doubt asking yourself nyes friends the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story nprobably for the sake of using cgi since it did nothing but hurt the story nin most parts they werent bad just nothing special nbut they were more than a little on the hokey side nexcept of course when we got to the ridiculous climax of this movie nthe grand finales special effects went right into the toilet at that point nit almost looked like they had run out of money nthese effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production ni took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors dont mix nstay far away from this version of tarzan n
 flubber is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney nits the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids but anyone else will feel left out as its boring slow and incredibly lifeless nwhat could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water and its a shame because it could have been a great film nhypothetically i mean n flubber as you probably know is a remake of the disney classic i never saw the absent minded professor where a well absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as flubber you know flying rubber nthe new one keeps the basic plot but appears to have added a lot else like more absentmindedness on the part of the proffessor some more villains and several showstopping moments like a big rumba with the flubber and some more elaborate setups none which really make it any better but instead make it worse nthe basic plot revolves around a college professor philip brainerd robin williams who creates lots and lots of inventions but is sadly absent minded nin fact hes forgotten his wedding to the colleges president sara jean reynolds indie actress marcia gay harden two times before he forgets it again at the beginning ndoesnt this warrant some kind of mental treatment nanyway on his wedding day the third one he invents the flubber which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in the abyss nphilip believes that this invention once fully realized will save his college which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoonvillain chester hoenicker raymond j barry which is ironically enough the same college his brat son will wheaton thought he was dead goes to nthrough a plot twist hoenickers goons named smith and wesson ha ha what a great sense of humor this film has who are played by clancy brown and ted levine both who needed the pay check discover it the hard way and try to steal for hoenicker who wants it just cause hes evil enough na subplot involves philips attempts to win back sara whos angry at him and with good reason but who is being seduced by who is basically philips belloq wilson croft christopher mcdonald playing the hysterically suaveyetunsuave asswhole once again nand in another subplot philips daytimer robot weebo voiced by the oneandonly jodi benson falls in love with him nyuckityyuck nwhats most pathetic about this film is how dull it is nyou dont need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry halfassedly remixing classics or nonclassics for distribution to the general public who sadly eats it all up nearlier in 97 they released jungle 2 jungle an adaptation of a really awful french film un indien dans la ville which yeah improved over the original but not by much ndisneys in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now only creatively nin the rush to ship out a film for distribution disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called magic nsuch scenes as dancing flubber a flying car a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze delight or even cause people to laugh ni sat there the entire film stone faced chuckling perhaps twice and shaking my head at all the bad jokes nwho could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ndidnt think so nit doesnt help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable nphilip is not a lovable absent minded professory just a really dumb man being played by robin williams nwilliams is a brilliant comic actor okay a brilliant actor in general but here hes given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something and other times act sad nthose times hes not bad nbut what are we supposed to think of a man whos forgotten his wedding thrice nmaybe it was funny andor respectable in the 60s ni like disney and i usually enjoy their films not only animated but live action and their recent films save for hercules which was good but not great have been worse than lackluster theyve been pathetic n jungle 2 jungle is probably the worst film i saw last year n flubber s probably second nwhat do they need to do nperhaps create something new nget writers who can write something thats universally entertaining nfilms like the parent trap and mary poppins are films that are live action or in the latter case a mix of both but even i can still watch them because theyre not only written to be magical to children but to be fun to adults nwhats more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at

the haunting a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film to scare us nif youve ever seen a movie which you probably have considering you are on this website you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie nthey have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film nbut the one i always like are the other name joke that try and rename a particular film nfor instance the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film small soldiers nthey had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size nwell after seeing the haunting i had a few particular names for it as well nunfortunately i can only post one of them otherwise id be getting some pretty angry emails from overprotective mothers nthat title would be the confusing nok that is a pretty bad title but it fits this film perfectly nit basically serves up no purpose and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb nliam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth nthe haunting is nothing but trash but unfortunately will still make a boatload of money nbefore i rant and rave about how bad this film is let me point out the few and i stress the word few bright spots in this film nfirst the house is great looking nit looks beautiful but this is also a dark spot nit looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it nthis is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film nthings look so great that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight nhaunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie nthe hill house is not eerie nit is beautiful but not the least bit frightening never heard of lili taylor nbefore this film i did not but i am glad that i do now nshe gives the only satisfactory performance in the film ndespite the dry dialogue and boringconfusing concept she manages to light up the screen every time she appears but unfortunately her costars are usually following right behind nowen wilson who plays luke is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance other then taylor nhe is basically there for the comic relief and his character development is poor in all other areas nall of the characters are desperately underdeveloped nwilson had potential as luke but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs nliam neeson and catherine zetajones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film ntheir characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot nthey just are not believable and this is the final nail in the hauntings coffin nthe plot is terrible nthe opening scene of the film is very important but the director makes it too obvious by getting closeups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film nas i sat through the film i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish nnell lili taylors character goes from the hunted to the savior nit makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film nhe forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any indepth information nfor instance the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program nbut we get zilch for the other four nplus two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes nand the worst part most horror films have killings nfor some reason they kill off luke at the end of the film nno reason whatsoever just off with his head literally noverall the haunting is the epitome of a bad movie nbad plot confusing storyline and a waste of good talent nhopefully liam neeson can rebound and get into a good film and be used to his full potential nhopefully lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film nand hopefully other horror films such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house will not be as bad as this one n
anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landons fact based novel the king and i and its big expensive and soulless nthough goodlooking its lavish sets fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meersons script nso much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting nthis is jodie fosters first movie since the jawdroppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isnt the best choice to show off her acting chops nshes trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens the uptight widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam now thailand with her son to instruct the kings chow yunfat son in the ways of the west because the ways of england are the ways of the world nthe king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family 58 kids with 10 more in the way impressive no nthe eldest prince is none too happy about this father have i offended you in some way nwhy do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher but soon gets to know anna and her stern motherwholovesyou personality better and comes to like her nmeanwhile siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma nthe king and his close advisors suspect that this is britains doing which arouses suspicion in siam putting anna in an uncomfortable position nshe is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the kings prejudices nhe though selfrighteous as ever cant help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly quietly develop affections for each other nthere is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the kings younger daughters dies nits your classic deathbed scene with the girls mournful eyes staring at her father who tries only semi successfully to maintain his composure nanna then comes in and cries a bit nthe sequence was there for a purpose to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer nim usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time i was just sitting there my emotions untouched nthis remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren nwe never develop connections to the characters never given a reason to care nthis ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant whose last film was ever after one of my favorites of 1998 ni do not doubt tennants ability to put together a decent movie but anna and the king aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient nthe sets and scenery are gorgeous but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur neven terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from 75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia nwe feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with largerthanlife awe ni liked both foster and yunfat who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles nfosters generally stoic persona serves her well here as she is playing a reserved formal and rather underdeveloped character nyunfat is especially effective perfectly conveying the king of siams sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts nwhat does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations nthe cast is great the director is talented and the budget is lavish but this illadvised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole nthis is an emotionless costume epic n
i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films nwhen done right with at least slightly evident restraint they can be engaging sweeping appealing nbut its a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle a hollow boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers the ones willing to buy into ephrons whiny views of life and romance ntom hanks and meg ryan two of hollywoods most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed repectively nbaldwins wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son jonah seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse njonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems nsam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out nephron has him do this so that annie reed meg ryan can hear it nannie is a happy woman nshe is engaged to walter an allergyprone working man and seems to be perfectly content nbut after hearing sam the widower on the radio show she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it nfive years after this movie hit theaters hanks ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better although still subpar romantic comedy youve got mail which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet nat least that movie had a sense of spontaneity nhere it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five nthe fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory nsleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie odonnell nbut none of them can save the film from being a bore nits characters are dull and empty its script isnt funny or particularly charming nthe script has a fundamental problem annie gives up for little reason her life with walter to pursue sleepless in seattle whom she has never even seen nits the kind of life decision that real people dont make and its a major unforgivable plausibility sacrifice nin essence this movies purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldnt even exist nits a ten minute short film with ninetyfive minutes of filler nif you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didnt have to review it you could just call me asleep in philadelphia n 1999 eugene novikov n
long ago films were constructed of strong dialogue original characters memorable plot points and solid acting none of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is nthis opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic and i mean tragic life of novalee nation natalie portman nhitting the road with her hick guitarplaying boyfriend in a rustedout gm novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby due in a month nstopping off at a nearby walmart for a quick rest novalees boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there nnovalee then decides to secretly hole up in the walmart because shes not the brightest bulb in the stagelights na wacky librarian keith david comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store nthen the she moves in with a family befriends everyone in town including ashley judds character who has five kids and still can work parttime as a nurse fights off religious freaks survives a tornado breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her receives an inheritance builds a martha stewartesque house becomes an awardwinning photographer and manages to always look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot all while not once doing anything with her kid nthis film is terrible nthe directing is awful it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them over and over and over again nwe get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman who can do good work na disjointed pacing of key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off na subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the walmart parking lot nan embarrassing display of emotions by the characters making the audience ill ntaking two great comedic screenwriters babaloo mandel and lowell ganz and forcing them to write drama on par with oprahs book club naltogether it has the feeling of being trapped at home watching a very bad television miniseries and wishing it to end only the remote is broken nhowever the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up where is the heart nno one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk n
in double jeopardy the stakes are high nthink of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker nthe finished product although able to maintain the viewers attention is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script nalex ill take homicide for 400 nlibby parsons ashley judd is a happily married mom leading a normal life none night her husband nick bruce greenwood takes her out for a romantic escape on a sailboat nlibby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared nshe follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck where she handles a fallen knife like any stupid character and is spotted by the coast guard who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening nnick is presumed dead and although she pleads her innocence libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband nnow please dont think im spoiling any vital plot details because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans nif you havent seen this preview dont read any further nbut seriously the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas s cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters nduring the most vital scenes in the movie i was anticipating every twist or surprise that eventually popped up on the screen ni imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals nmost unfortunately will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production none is tommy lee jones who plays travis lehman a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison njones is always wonderful as an authority figure and hes certainly familiar with this sort of role as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals njudd as a likable heroin with gusto also has a chance to flex her acting abilities nwhile emotionally unconvincing the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role perking up the movie like an injection of antidepressant nthe actors and their relationship together present the onetwo punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely nand now back to the plot nwhile behind bars libby learns an interesting little bit of information a person cant be convicted of the same crime twice nthis law called double jeopardy could be her motive for hunting down her husband nwho may still be alive nyes you heard right nthe movie degenerates into a crosscountry chase where everything you expect to happen ndoes nthe final scenes which could have redeemed the film are poorly handled by director bruce beresford whose previous work centers highly around drama driving miss daisy paradise road nironically it is those elements like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son that dont quite work here nat least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars nunfortunately jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive and the real depth of his character is only skin deep nbut he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material and both have some memorable comic moments njudd in particular has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her parole officer nhmmm nperhaps this would have made a good comedy nit is disappointing because there are the makings of a competent action film here nits nicely shot and choreographed in downtown vancouver and will entertain those who arent turned off by the woeful storyline n tis a shame that double jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldnt fool most children n
by the time dennis quaid the ostensible star of switchback makes his first appearance at about the 22minute mark you may find yourself wondering why he bothered nafter all writerdirector jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines nthe first finds amarillo texas sheriff buck olmstead r lee ermey facing a hotlycontested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction nas olmstead begins his investigation we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects nlane dixon jared leto is an enigmatic young hitchhiker bob goodall danny glover is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination nall the necessary conflicts seem to be in place the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the others protagonist nbut then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse nlacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years nhes not supposed to be tracking him any more according to the bureau theyve got their man but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise ntwo months earlier lacrosses own son was kidnapped by the killer and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere nlacrosse knows his killers work and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game nit wouldnt be fair to reduce everything thats wrong with switchback to quaids presence but its a pretty good place to start ntheres a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center as a dramatic actor dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation nwe can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tightjawed sourpuss pucker we can tell hes grim because every word comes out in an eastwoodesque rasp na more flexible performer might have given weight to the character pulling the audience into his haunted intensity making switchback his film nquaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated nits tough to become emotionally invested in a characters turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes neven without quaid it doesnt appear that switchback would have stayed on course nthe early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy building our curiosity over which man the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor is the real threat nunfortunately stuart tips his hand far too early in the game both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal nonce the mystery of the killers identity is dispatched the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable nin fact stale and predictable describes the direction that switchback takes in general falling back on fartoocommon hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere a climactic fistfight on board a freight train and edgy law enforcement agents nits too bad stuart wasnt willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film nplayed with atypical restraint by r lee ermey hes a wonderful unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions na film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a filmmaker willing to take a few risks with his casting and storytelling ninstead stuart places his trust in a name star who cant carry the material nmaybe next time hell throw away that one crucial page in the script the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story n
plot something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and nonhorror movies noh yeah theres also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit but trust me you wont care much about the plot in this film ncritique parody movies either work or they dont and this one just doesnt work nthe laughs arent as pronounced this time around the energy level the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here nits like they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something wink wink nand the scariest part of it all ncheck out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy seven ni say again it took seven people to write 82minutes worth of fart jokes halfassed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror nnow im not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed funny sketch ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on saturday night live nthere are a couple of funny oneliners but mostly just rehashed onejoke scenes a lot of dead silence and lame gags nadd to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here the films website isnt even up yet nwhat the f ni do however have to give it up to james woods the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all the exorcist takeoff miss this and youve missed any reason to see the flick ni especially liked his oneliner as he walked in to see the possessed womans head turning nvery funny nunfortunately the film plummets straight down after that with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude wheres my car and other action movies like charlies angels and mission impossible 2 now help me figure this one out will you nisnt this supposed to be a parody film of horror movies n or maybe thats just the title of the film fing with my head nwell im sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lameass script nthe wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers money instead of the zucker brothers comedy for this sequel nunfortunately for us all were left with here is a skeleton of a film which mightve been funny had it been worked over a few more times tightened up here and there and been injected with more solid laughs nbut as things stand now there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last years film has led everyone down this path so screw them for not trying as hard critically speaking of course nyou should all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough real effort into this chopjob and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents npooh on you n thats telling em joblo nsheesh nbtw im allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson whose massive breasts and skanky gstring had me chompin at the bit nyou go girl neveryone else stay nwheres joblo coming from nairplane 1010 airplane ii 1010 galaxy quest 810 hannibal 710 the haunting 310 mafia 510 naked gun 810 scary movie 810 top secret 910 n

note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned n quick robin nthe antishark repellant n adam west in the 1966 batman feature film casually kicking at a patheticlooking rubber shark attached to his leg ni had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness but in many instances batman and robin nears and at some point even exceeds this standard nthis is a disasterously bad film easily the worst in the series to date and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive its loud garish and obnoxious with pointless gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill nbatman and robin features the caped crusaders george clooney debuting as batman with chris odonnell returing as robin squaring off against another bevy of chemicallyinduced villains the nefarious icecold mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights and the slinky poison ivy uma thurman who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result but whatever and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss nby ivys side is the giant steroid monster bane jeep swanson a grunting hulk of a beast nthe villains goals are noble ones freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife vendela dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation and ivys intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth albeit by destroying all human life nmeanwhile on the homefront life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth michael gough and the arrival of his niece barbara alicia silverstone nakiva goldsmans screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad with astonishingly terrible dialogue lame jokes and an awful bythenumber plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement nit makes goldsmans screenplay of batman forever which i thought was dreadful look positively inspired in comparison ni am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which id seen used in no joke an episode of gilligans island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production njoel schumachers direction of batman and robin is horrific with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance nthere is a clear conceit towards neon in this film even moreso than with his previous batman forever with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo just in case i suppose if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin and with neon prominently figuring in an utterlypointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivys chosen new abode nanother action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving latenight motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons nmr schumachers focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible to the detriment of the story there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between allout camp and heartfelt drama with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective nit is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the films opening even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered nis batman and robin supposed to be campy ni think it is its hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously n one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted bomb neach time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory nis it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ni somehow doubt it the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isnt attempting to be the utter farce which it is narnold schwarzenegger is topbilled in the film as the villainous mr freeze and is bland and uninteresting perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be nmr schwarzeneggers attempts to be menacing are laughable and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable frankly everything he does onscreen is laughable nby the end of the film i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen nthe bulk of his performance consists of uttering nearunintelligble puns and oneliners featuring every possible permutation of cool nin the least inventive way ngeorge clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin being overshadowed by the villains and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film nhis batman is hardly an imposing figure nchris odonnell is unimpressive in a onenote performance while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all nthe films one saving grace nundoubtably uma thurmans entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy nher work in batman and robin is certainly overthetop but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film nms thurmans comic timing is impeccable and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully n im already starting to positively reassess jim carreys performance in batman forever nher amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film and when shes offscreen the film greatly suffers ni figure that if one has to die being kissed to death by uma thurman isnt a halfbad way to go nwhile batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulsepounding excitement i must admit that i was not bored watching it although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or oneliner and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat nits been a long time since ive laughed so much at a movie n at of course is the operative word n

youd think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games nit hasnt worked so far n street fighter n super mario brothers n wing commander n mortal kombat nnot a watchable film in the bunch nstill i held out some hope for tomb raider nafter all the games premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept nhowever despite the potential of the project tomb raider proves to be yet another bomb nthe plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies ntheres a onceever5000years alignment of planets coming up and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world nof course the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world nour heroine lady lara croft angelina jolie finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father jon voight dug up nshe figures that if she gets the triangle she can bring her dad back from the dead nof course no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway nin both video games and action movies the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences nhowever the action in tomb raider shows little style or originality ntheres lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap directtocable flick nthe other goofy archeologist flick of the summer the mummy returns was much better it had its flaws but its action was creative and largescale nsince winning her academy award for girl interrupted jolie hasnt taken any projects that would display her acting talents n tomb raider seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts so much attention is drawn to them that its a shame theres no oscar for best performance by a wonderbra nwhile we dont see much of her acting ability with the exception of a wonderful uppercrust british accent we do get a hint of jolies less savory side nconsidering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father and uninterested in any of the living males around her seems a poor choice nhaving jolies real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier ni havent decided what to make of director simon west yet nhis first feature was the starstudded disaster con air but my opinion of him improved with the generals daughter which was thick with sultry atmosphere nnow this train wreck ni hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series the prisoner nhollywood has already screwed up the avengers and the prisoner represents a chance for redemption n by the way speaking of british tv red dwarf fans should look for chris rimmer barrie in his first major film role n
1989s major league was a delightful surprise ni didnt expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable but it proved to be fresh and funny nhowever when the appeal of a movie is its freshness the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale nthats certainly true of major league ii and the most recent entry major league back to the minors nthe title is of course a contradiction nshouldnt it be minor league nthat contradiction suggests the lengths to which writerdirector john warren has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first movie noriginal stars charlie sheen and tom berenger who returned for major league ii are not around leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie nthe other veterans who return dennis haysbert as voodooinspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka who was introduced in league ii seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise nthe only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle inexplicably broadcasting the games of a minor league team far from his home turf nthe protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell scott bakula who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn bernsen to manage the twins aaa team the buzz nyou can write the movie from here he finds a group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as a team in order to win ntheres a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing walton goggins an exballet dancer kenneth johnson a brokendown old timer thom barry twin outfielders both named juan the difilippo triplets and a couple pitchers with throwing problems judson mills and peter mackenzie nalong the way gus picks up cerrano and tanaka gus is supposedly an old teammate of theirs even though he wasnt in either of the preceding films nsum total none nthe entire enterprise is artificial and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors ngus antagonist is twins manager leonard huff ted mcginley nleonard is a slimy sniveling little egotist and the twins are lazy spoiled and full of themselves n even watching the first movie i wondered why any reallife team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner ngus challenges leonard to a match the buzz vs the twins n wanna guess who wins n back to the minors is a movie that has no reason to exist ntheres hardly a laugh in it the cast is weak and the first movie left no room for even one sequel n
when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy i expect negative reviews from critics left and right npredictable unoriginal and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to yous and the drive me crazys released by the dozens these last couple of years nwhat i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while im sitting in the theater nam i enjoying myself nis this a comfortable break from my week of finals nthis is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i wont remember next week nso last week i opened up the new york times and no surprise boys and girls got a negative review ndaily news nnegative nreelviews nnegative nepinions com nnegative nthis was nothing new namerican pie final destination road trip didnt get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures nsame goes for shes all that a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded nsince boys and girls reunites shes all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr i predicted d j vu al over again nbut still curious i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it the reactions were far from positive ni had made up my mind ill catch it on video or cable in a couple of years nbut soon after following a series of unexpected events we couldnt get into shaft because it is rated r i found myself watching boys and girls nwhoops nboys and girls is about a nerdy smart boy named ryan prinze jr and a popular flirt girl named jennifer claire forlani nbriefly meeting as preteens and now attending the same college the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends nbut in the movies a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other nwith advice from their roommates amanda detmer jason biggs ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship nthe film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found ni could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons nthe dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to nit is almost offensive nan example of an insightful conversation n youre dumb ndumb dumb dumb dumb n no n followed by a mandy mooreesque tune background n well its not as bad as wing commander i guess nthe supporting cast is also painfully useless ndetmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring pointless subplots nand although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex prinze jrs ryan dominates the screen while forlanis jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with nwe never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character nteenager or not youll hate this movie i guarantee it nmaybe i should rent shes all that again nis it really as good as i think it is n
movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting entertaining or convincing because of one fundamental reason movies are made by adults and not teenagers noccasionally however films like say anything dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called teenagers ncant hardly wait however does not ninstead the writingdirecting team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich found in the teenage genre strip it completely of perception intelligence and wit and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to ncant hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation nthe main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them theres the average male protagonist preston ethan embry prom queen and cheerleader amanda jennifer lovehewitt football star mike peter facinelli white rapper wannabe kenny seth green computer geek william charlie korsmo and brainy outsider denise lauren ambrose ni couldnt stand any of those characters nwhether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming yo i gotta have sex tonight nall i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film napparently cant hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that its not funny nin all honesty elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour nand when i say forced i mean it nthey should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange nthis is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour nfor instance cant hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as i am a sex machine nfor some reason elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough eventually it will be funny nif only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk now thats funny n
like a good action film should metro has action that keeps you involved nsome action films have action sequences that are so conventional our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts n the ghost in the darkness which opened a few months ago is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving it not only invited my thoughts to divert me it nearly put me asleep nbut metro is one of the best action films in a while nit is hip sharp nifty and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy neddie murphy was in bad shape for a while nand this invites me to mention last year s the nutty professor which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be n metro happens to be a lot better than any film in the beverly hills cop series nthat is because metro takes itself seriously but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun neddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible and controlled people nthe beverly hills cop movies all featured eddie as a reckless wild cop always crossing the line by just an inch nin metro he plays a hostage negotiator so negotiation is his job not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble nhis character in metro takes himself seriously neddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in metro and perhaps it is quite better off that way nmurphy plays scott roper and as i previously mentioned he is a san francisco hostage negotiator nin the first tense situation in the film we are introduced to roper s kind of work as he tries to calm down a confused unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up nmurphy handles the scene seriously without his usual happygolucky misfit humor nthe film develops when its villain is established and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda a jewel thief and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim n metro takes different twists and slight turns and there is one great virtuoso chase scene involving the a cable car ncars flip ncars crash ncars turn over nand it is done so good in this film i was reminded of speed and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons nthere are also some other good scenes in metro that a lot of films would rather choose not to have nscenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning nof course the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling nthe scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice too nthose are the scenes that make up metro which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality nthe actor that i most enjoyed seeing in metro was michael rapaport who plays roper s new partner a lipreading bookskimming genius and a master of observation nit was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius nrapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really really dopey dimwit ni hardly recognized him in metro and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more nthere are two main types of villains in movies like this the ones that are part of the story and the ones that are devices nthe villain in metro is no more than a device but he is a darn good villain nonetheless nhe is played by michael wincott whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp as if he smokes a cigarette between every take nwincott makes his villain korda as mean as could be the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks like richard widmark in kiss of death nand in addition wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms in the film actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have who is no longer on my good list ni liked metro and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy nhis past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place possibly from murphy s growing as a person now having a family n metro is a nononsense movie nit works as a buddy movie which it does not overplay nit works as a dry comedy which it does not overplay nit works as a suspense film which it does not overplay nand it works as an action film where it does have a tendency to occasionally go allout nbut who cares nit still remains serious and it does not overdo itself noh and there were plenty of explosions in metro as well nhow nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those nif there is one major objection i had to metro it was the length an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes n metro is a film that lasted a little too long but it was still entertaining and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end npaul haynes n
these days we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old cult tv shows nmost of the times the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past nbut some five or six years ago there werent that many movies and the trend didnt look that depressing nso the people who like the author of this review grew up watching flintstones popular 1960s animated series about modern stone age family werent particularly worried when the word came about live action remake nafter all the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and if anything else at least the special effects would be good nthe plot revolves about flintstones family set in fictious stone age town of bedrock whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america nfred flinstone john goodman works in the quarry and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble rick moranis and his wife betty rosie odonnell to adopt a baby nto return the favour barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred and based on that fred gets wellpaid job in management nbut of course this is just a sham corrupt official cliff vandercave kyle maclachlan and his sultry secretary sharon stone halle berry need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme nin the meantime freds wife wilma elizabeth perkins must face her mother elizabeth taylor who cant stand fred non the superficial level the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life ncomputer effects are flawless and the costumes settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show nunfortunately problems with this film start with inadequate casting rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie odonnell nbut the greatest problem of all is plot or to be precise the lack of plot nsome thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame original characters onedimensional and many elements of the story like embezzlement and interoffice politics totally incomprehensible for the little children the main targeted audience of this film nresult is almost unwatchable mess occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as high concept nafter great hype movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version nall in all film isnt that bad but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it n

susan grangers review of americas sweethearts columbiasony nwhat a waste of a talented cast nbilly crystal and cowriter peter tolan have concocted a sly provocative premise and as the opening credits roll its obvious that theyre attempting an oldfashioned romantic comedy nthe story involves a veteran publicist billy crystal who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director christopher walken holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room refusing to show it to anyone nhe figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the films oncemarriedbutnowestranged stars gwen and eddie catherine zetajones john cusack theyll be so distracted that they wont remember they didnt see the movie or it wasnt what they expected n and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony criticdavid manning quote scandal nfor help he turns to gwens personal assistantsister julia roberts nbut the laughs are few and farbetween ncrystals glib cynical flack isnt wickedly funny enough with a few amusing oneliners nafter six months under the care of a depak chopralike guru alan arkin cusacks characters too emotionally fragile lacking the necessary charisma nzetajoness vain narcissistic diva is undeveloped and onedimensional nonly hank azaria as zetajoness muchmacho spanish lover and stanley tucci as a studio exec and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth nbasically we dont like these egodriven stereotypical characters let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements and joe roths direction is predictable formulaic and telegraphic non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 americas sweethearts is a contrived shallow 4 as a screwball satire its strictly superficial n
nostalgia for the 70s continues as we see a revival of one of the decades greatest achievements the marijuana comedy nhowever half baked doesnt quite run with all its brain cells and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more nthe plot follows the misadventures of four neerdowell stoners ntheres the groups unofficial leader thurgood david chappelle scarface guillermo diaz brian jim breuer and kenny harland williams nkenny gets into trouble when while on a munchie run feeds his snack foods to a diabetic police horse nwhen the animal keels over he finds himself accused of killing a police officer and facing a 1 000 000 bail nhis friends promise to raise money for a 10 bail bond but have no idea how nthat is until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as a janitor nsoon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson clarence williams iii nfor a comedy the film is pretty humorless nnot that it doesnt try its njust that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat nthe four leads are nearly all playing the same character nonly williams stands out while still performing on the level of his humorfree comedy rocket man but that is because hes imprisoned throughout most of the film giving a much needed change of pace but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another nto help out the film is packed full of cameos nsteven wright tommy chong janeane garofalo willie nelson snoop doggy dogg and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another nnone of them work beyond the simple hey thats level nin fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle nnot as his bland pothead lead but in his second role as a potobsessed rapper sir smokealot ngranted its pretty much a onejoke role and there arent a ton of laughs but this film needs every one it can scrape up nto top it off and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film thurgood is given a love interest mary jane rachel true nher role is that of the public service announcement to inform us why doing drugs including pot is wrong nher character seems fabricated merely as a defense to the your film promotes the use of drugs camp nthe film would have been better off by sticking with the rebel tone it so eagerly tries to claim nyet in the end it doesnt really matter nwatching the film clean and sober you are bound to recognize how truly awful it is n
what a contrast nin the space of two days i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly nim not sure you could get two more different movies nwhile the former was all over the top telegraphing everything shoving its philosophy of life down our throats hurlyburly was the complete opposite wound so tight and with so much buried in its script one could spend weeks thinking about it nthis is one interesting movie nits very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of 98 in the company of men although not quite so nasty ntheres lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men nhurlyburly doenst contain much plot we just follow eddie sean penn around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him nhis big question is does it all pertain to him nand if it does how is he supposed to feel about it all n it means everything television friends events that happen ni guess it could be summed up more crudely as whats it all about nthis is not a movie for answers ndonna anna paquin gives some but theyre not really satisfying they just lead to more questions nthats what makes this movie stay on your mind nthese are the sorts of questions that occupy our time neven when we push them to the background however we resolve these questions influences everything we do nthe performances are all superb in hurlyburly ni havent seen sean penn in much before in fact i cant remember seeing him in anything but he is brilliant in this neddie isnt a likeable character but sean penn makes him understandable ni dont want to be his friend but id like to help him nchazz palminteri is also great as phil making him an awful person nid never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend neveryone in this film nails their performances making this world real nits a nasty world its a sexist world nunlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct hurlyburly is a mans world seen unapologetically through the eyes of men ni find this fascinating and on two counts depressing nfirst its depressing that such a world exists na large part of hurlyburlys success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world toys playthings nsure everyone is background to everyone else but in this world women are a long way in the background nsecond these are the movies that are being made stories about mens world nwhere are the stories about womens world nnot the soap operas and the chick flicks that are meant to satisfy women but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men nhurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts nits very talkative intelligent and static nwhile this can make the film drag a bit and people sometimes sound like theyre quoting textbooks mostly this is a good thing nnot all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas nnot all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience nall it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen nit also means that you have to pay attention n
vampires is a rude chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse present only to pleasure men feed vampires readied to be bashed or beaten till ones sensibilities is shocked by the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie nto make matters worse the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks and deserve to have their heads bitten off if not their bodies carved in half nthe dilemma of hating the heroes as much as the villains makes one wish that the hand of god would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion njames wood portrays jack crow a man obsessed with killing vampires whose soul reason for living is based on revenge they killed his parents but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires nas for adam baldwin he is nothing more than a stooge who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts action and the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the female sex nas for the claims that the catholic church created dracula well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury with enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame nan awful movie on all counts my suggestion is to bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent rude vampire slayers n
 meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood nscreams the television ads for hanging up disastrously written by reallife sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton nmake me laugh again nnot only is hanging up misadvertised since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two costars lisa kudrow and diane keaton little more than extended cameos but they dont actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes nand we are supposed to believe their strong bond and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship despite them being apart for the majority of the running time nexcuse me again while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion neve marks meg ryan is the middle mozzell sister still living in the california town where she grew up and with a husband adam arkin and preteen son jesse james nher elderly wisecracking father lou walter matthau in his brightest performance in years has just recently been put into the hospital in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimers even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him nwhile eves relationship with her mother cloris leachman is nearly nonexistent since she ran out on lou and her children years ago she has had her fair share of ups and downs with lou who used to be an alcoholic nher older sister is georgia diane keaton an editor for the selftitled magazine georgia while maddy lisa kudrow is the youngest a soap opera actress ninterestingly their professions are given but we not once ever see them working at their jobs or for that matter learn much of anything about them nmaddy georgia and eve do not see each other much anymore their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another nand they talk nand talk nand talk nin fact the telephone is the major star of the film even more so than ryan as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long nif you are able to get through the opening halfhour in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them you will surely survive the rest nthe question is who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating selfinvolved patontheback nhow could a comedydrama that has the starpower of meg ryan lisa kudrow and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways nissues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up but the film isnt mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought nalso it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another but no dynamic metamorphosizes nand when they do reunite in the finale their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying threeminute scene in which they argue like little children nyou can see the impending death coming a mile away and it conveniently occurs in the next scene so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves and with each other nyou think to yourself the only thing left for them to do is have a playful foodfight and like clockwork it also occurs by the end credits nmeg ryan is a versatile actress look no further than 1998s hurlyburly or 1994s when a man loves a woman despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies nwith hanging up the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron a writerdirectorhack who shouldnt be allowed to work in hollywood again after this bigbudget highprofile debacle neven if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department she nonetheless is very good and the two scenes that work flashbacks to christmas 1988 when she had a heartbreaking runin with her mother and to halloween 1993 when lou crashed her sons birthday party in a drunken stupor are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations ndiane keaton as georgia is better as an actress than a director here but that is a wildly feeble compliment nwhat is more than a little farfetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children she is no more than five years ryans senior nyeah right nlastly poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a bigscreen venture after her even more thin role in 1999s analyze this nkudrow isnt given enough time to create a full personality with maddy so it isnt her fault she doesnt register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue nif anything though kudrow is a real talent and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time as in her brilliantly nuanced oscarcaliber work in 1998s the opposite of sex nif you are a fan of kudrows and who isnt do yourself a favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than hanging up does in its entirety nas eves hardworking husband adam arkin is predictably squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do until a subplot reveals itself midway through only to never be mentioned again ncloris leachman as with ryan and matthau makes a small but noticeable impression with her albeit very brief appearance while edie mcclurg as a rosycheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production nnearly all the emotions displayed within hanging up are patently manufactured and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters aside from eve why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats nif for some bizarre twilight zone type of reason you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over nsaying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions n
as you should know this summer has been less than memorable nwith a total of 4 decent films its not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing nwith that said you can pretty much predict what my opinion on the 13th warrior will be nthe film is based on the michael crichton eaters of the dead in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king nafter tarveling for many months he comes across a gang of norsemen who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog nso they start picking men and are left without 1 thus ahmed is choosen nso far it sounds interesting right nnot when all of this takes place in 15 minutes nafter that they basically run around killing nthat alone shows how much a script is needed for a film because once your story is introduced you have the rest of the film to start developing it nobviously thats not the case here neven if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure you will be disappointed nsince all the action takes place in fog it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances and to poor camera work ncant the camera men sit still nid like to actually watch a film in focus but again they failed to deliver that as well nthe film moves on and on until the point where you can care less about anything but the popcorn youre eating nwith corny dialogue that the characters laugh at for some odd reason a script that goes nowhere dull action sequences a predictable ending and worst of all weak characters theres basically nothing to like here except for maybe the set designs nthats the only thing that honestly caught my interest nwhen i heard that john mctiernan the director wanted his name kept out of the project that made me wonder why nwell now i know ncrichtons greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product which led to a big arguement nwhats there to argue about anyway nthe film couldnt be saved no matter how much they spent or casted nseeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money i wouldnt be surprised to see the 13th warrior become a hit nplease do me a favor and save your money at all costs or else you will be lost in the fog like the film itself n
this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard nthe rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend ned nkelly the socalled robin hood of the aussies nbut he fails to be convincing in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly nthe film opens to a bw prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution nthen it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback coming home from jail after a 3year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family nthis scene is set in 1871 nin the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings as he sings shel silversteins lyrics which tells of neds hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be a republic nned says a debt must be paid nas he hears voices from his dead father his classdivided country and his conscience all telling him to get revenge nso begins neds romp through australias outback seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered nhe begins by stealing horses after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray which favors the rich landowners nwhen hes only 20 he forms a gang causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds nwhen neds mother clarissa kaye is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to 35 years ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mothers freedom nwhen the authorities refuse the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers nrampaging through the outback they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes who dont trust the traps police nspoiler to follow in the next paragraph nin the climax kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in a saloon and captured nneds brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive nbut kellys gang escapes as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers as they become decoys nthis was a flat presentation hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kellys call for justice njagger didnt have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson nthe story failed to focus on australia seemingly a more british film than australian nunder richardsons lackluster direction all jagger seemed to do was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge which soon became a shrill cry nif you want to see a better film about ned kelly catch mad dog morgan 76 a much truer and more daring version with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kellys madness something this film could only do in a hohum manner n
it seemed like the perfect concept nwhat better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality nits exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh njim carreys signed on too neven better nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just couldnt take a joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy nyes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isnt funny nits not for lack of trying nthe farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most highconcept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them nthis of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely tooforgiving nature making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult nsoon enough charlies repressed aggression manifests itself into a second independent personality named hank a deepvoiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster nthis guy isnt above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which hes been insulted or holding a little girls head underwater because she refused to stop jumproping in the street nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks nsome have suggested that this isnt a problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesnt require plot to work ntheyre wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort 1996s theres something about mary n 1999s outside providence was technically an earlier project nthe brothers earlier film wasnt funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected nin mary the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleightofhand trick theyd have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion n me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work nhaving been produced by the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes nbut they havent come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote bythenumbers adolescent comedy nthe plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p waters renee zellweger whos in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending thats entirely predictable from the getgo n think charlie and irene will fall in love nyeah me too nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you havent already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely softtossed presenting an obvious problem when grossout humor loses its shock value its no longer funny merely gross nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry ntake for example the subplot involving charlies three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and whitebread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely toopleasant smile on his face nbut by the end of the film theyre still doing the same schitck it hasnt been elevated to another funnier level and it hasnt been dropped either nthats too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through n me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlies new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hanks actions nthis doesnt really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlies condition early on so they dont have any opportunity to be surprised by it nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesnt go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax njim carrey is a gifted comedian both physically and vocally but hes left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in all of me nits a great showcase of flexibility and splitsecond roleshifting but none of it is terribly funny ncarrey doesnt pull any stunts we dont expect him to pull and the farrellys script doesnt give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the roleshifting arent set up in any meaningful way nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better nzellwegers irene is not a strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strongwilled nirene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether shes ditzy clever or neither nas such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straightlaced for a movie like this nhe like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected nafter viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked nbut i dont believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style nif the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and i still think they are theyll rebound just fine neven after that happens though ill still consider me myself irene to be a highcaliber misfire n

the following review encompasses two versions of dune ndune the theatrical version 1984 runtime 137 minutes capsule review cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book nthe films visual splendour mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative ndune the extended version 1988 runtime 189 minutes capsule review a bit of a throwtogether assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television nit was disowned by director david lynch but its considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline nquality dubs of this version from the outofprint japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web n the review nreleased in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of 40 million the film of frank herberts cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by scifi fans ndirector david lynch blue velvet eraserhead twin peaks was working on his biggest production to date a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico nthe screenplay was lynchs own chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected ndune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors nthe key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis dune a windswept desert planet thats home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange nthe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe nit extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it nmost importantly it allows the navigators of the spacing guild once human but now hideously mutated to fold space and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish nlynchs film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the storys two main strands none is the longstanding rivalry between two families houses atreides and house harkonnen and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis nthe second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah longawaited by the natives of arrakis the fremen nthe deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom nunfortunately this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended nthe thinking among universals ohsowise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office nwith lynchs initial cut running at closer to three or more hours the studio demanded that further cuts be made nwhat a great idea nwhy not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible nthe most glaring consequence of this oneeyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters nthus their personalities are vague their motivations unclear and in the case of pauls father duke leto their demise rather meaningless nthe end result is a distinct chill we cant warm to most of the cast and we dont care much for them nand it hardly helps that the voiceover narration is sparse and that the duneesque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book ndune is also a very serous film nthe constant selftalk by various characters makes it so serious and selfabsorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment nthe overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them nhumour or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnens mad sadistic kind is hard to find nyou may balk at the comparison but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus star wars trilogy nthe theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster however nit still possesses enough of lynchs stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative scifi nspecial effects whiz carlo rambaldis giant sandworms are an awesome sight nboth the production design anthony masters and costume design bob ringwood are striking and original nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years nwith these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis lush cinematography the film is at least a feast for the senses nsee it in the widescreen format if you can nand despite all the cuts several cast members still make a strong impression most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen nsian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam leader of the bene gesserit religious order whos secret aim is to manipulate pauls destiny for its own shadowy ends nas paul atreides the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade nthe conclusion nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herberts original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker ndavid lynch took a brave stab at it and partly due to forces beyond his control ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects ndune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release nmany chose to stay away altogether as the films disastrous box office showing attests nthe extended version however is a rather different beast nin 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition directors cut of the film on home video a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres nbut alas he failed to do so choosing to move on to other projects nin a way then it is partly lynchs own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa nstung into action lynch successfully petitioned the directors guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with allen smithee the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous judas booth ncertainly looking at the results of mcas handiwork theres at least half a dozen instances that for sheer technical sloppiness are good enough reasons for the director to object nbut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas nmost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration both of which fill many holes in the original versions storyline npauls relationship with his father and associates is more intimate with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor the spacing guild the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained npauls initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably nand as further background a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe nas a piece of storytelling then mca tvs version of dune is clearly superior nas a piece of editing however it is at times surprisingly inept nthe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate ntheres some sloppy cutting too and in a few instances shots even appear out of order nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes eg nships coming and going soldiers coming and going is at times clearly outofcontext nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected and rightly so nit should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u s television nbut the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasnt even in herberts book nthe scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his heart plug nits a surreal and disturbing episode thats very lynchesque but adds nothing to what we already know the baron is a nasty piece of work ndespite its own peculiar flaws then the extended version of dune is a generally superior film nall up it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered fabricated or newly created sequences nunless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart the alan smithee version remains the closest well get to what the movie should have been non repeated viewings one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit nstill as one of this centurys great sciencefiction novels some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen nwith rumours circulating of a new six hour miniseries planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga n

miramax disinvited online media from press screenings of scream 3 nthey ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoilerfilled reviews and post them prior to the films february 4th release

disappointingly the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes one of which might spring to life is an elaborate and attenuated payoff nour other

hishertheir motive nironic selfreflection aside parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because theres at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume nwith scream 3 the novelty of ghostfaces evermutating identity has worn off some but the character remains conceptually potent nconceptually the execution of ghostfaces master plan this time around is creaky because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what wed come to understand in scream and scream 2 the movie gets in the silly habit of saying all bets are off nin reference to the rules of a trilogys third act but theres a difference between rule breaking and cheating nwith the departure of kevin williamson who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 that for reasons incomprehensible to me was ignored save the notion of stab 3 kruger needed to be reined in tighter and by wes craven ncravens direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects nhow else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo the slacker duo of kevin smith movies akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny nit pains me to write this but scream 3s comedy is generally laughless with the exception of welltimed performances by josh pais as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in cravens music of the heart jamie kennedy resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 and parker posey through sheer force of will as a bactress nthe visuals are much weaker in part three as wellthe occasional sweeping gesture of peter demings camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before n aside in the wake of columbine craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3why the sanctimony when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves nfinally marco beltramis music cues the suspense too blatantlydo you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 its mostly silent nsting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere here they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nervejangling score ni look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iiiwoefully out of synch with its prequels scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs nthe film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of

ive got to admit it nim a huge jim carrey fan ni loved the first ace ventura as well as the mask and dumb and dumberand even in batman forever which was a pretty awful movie carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good nuntil i saw ace ventura 2 i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying nsadly ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be ncarrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie but this time it is no longer funnyit is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i nthe plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof nsoon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and if not returned in four days will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other nonce again its up to ace to save the day using his uncanny detective skills nthose who have been disappointed by carreys more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him overacting to the best of his ability but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesnt capture the feel of the original nthe original benefited from what looked to be carreys constant hypedup improv sequences which were hysterically funny nhere however the tighter script which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies takes the improvised material from the first and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie giving carrey little chance to improvise ninstead his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly nbut one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself nin the first movie he was always cool and one step ahead of every one elseperfect for carreys offthewall approach nbut here ventura is made to look a lot stupider and is often made out as the straight guya role which is definitely not carreys style nthere are definitely some very funny moments but they are few and far between nthey are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura or even dumb and dumber n

its a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it nsuch is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film the last samurai nthough the blurb alludes to a jungle filled with political intrigue uneasy alliances and murderous enemies at every turn the story of the movie is actually quite simple and prosaic a middleaged japanese businessman named endo played by john fujioka and his assistant both of whom have samurai aspirations travel to africa in search of his ancestor who went to bring buddhism to africa nhe hires the services of downattheheels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo the redoubtable lance henriksen and his girlfriend arabella holzbog and travels to the camp of an armsmerchantcumsafarihost cumislamicmissionary john saxon and his wife lisa eilbacher nthey are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witchdoctor aspirations to conceal a prearranged arms deal which subsequently falls through ncongo escapes finds endos ancestors sword and comes back guns blazing to free the rest of them and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword nthe end nthe last samurai is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable nit is merely there nthe murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated subplots that are never explained and many scenes that make very little sense at all nthe film is shot through with all the tired old inscrutable japanese samurai and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie nit is quite slowpaced with only a bit of action near the end and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic nmost of the acting is fair with the possible exception of congos girlfriend nlance henriksen is his usual scenechewing self and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie nthe only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery ni paid 3 for this film from the discount rack at best buy and halfway suspect i overpaid for it nif you are in the mood for samurai read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie nskip the last samurai unless you are a diehard henriksen fan n
this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st nelsewhere for several years and i had understood that the directorscreenwriter had written for the show on occasion also ni am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations nor were they satisfactory nif i had to list a reason why nbut that would be getting ahead of myself besides its not immediately clear as there are so many problems with the film nadam arkin plays a gradeschool teacher who is sardonic cynical and somewhat abrasive but a good teacher nhe spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court none day he meets a drifter david morse who plays jack morrison on st nelsewhere in the park and inveigles him in a game of oneonone basketball nmorse turns out to be good and a friendship slowly develops between the two as their respective professions progress on the screenarkins teaching and morses selling of paper flowers to passing motorists nso far my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack ngood music to be sure but it doesnt replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the storyit makes the film somewhat minimalistic a technique i rarely admire nsuddenly their friendship is interrupted by morses introduction to a fellow teacher of arkins a woman arkin has long admired from afar but it too reticent to approach nit appears that she begins to admire morse who enjoys here attentions but isnt sure what to do about itshe doesnt realize that he is a drifter and knows nothing about his past and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else nuntil then i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film nthe conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a fullfledged failure nthe woman at least to me appeared to be fairly shallow i didnt realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse nsomehow this is made to appear as if it is arkins fault and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that hes gotten such a find of girlfriend nfrankly dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make punching her in the mouth not the least nafter this the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural nif i had to summarize a major gripe its that this is a story spread too thin that creates semilikable characters at the outset and then suddenly jerks them into being 16yearolds at the last moment nit might be truetolife with some people but that doesnt mean i have to like it ni dont n navoid n
i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor an innocuousenoughonthesurface romantic comedy nits not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity but there it was nonetheless ni sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 nin a word its the same thing thats wrong with so many movies circa 1999 writing nmore to the point its the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when youre telling a story about a relationship nthe bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where were expected to get dewyeyed over any pairing of attractive pleasant people just because theyre attractive and pleasant nin this particular case attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon chris odonnell a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage nits a scary notion for jimmy even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne renee zellweger his girlfriend of three years nconvinced despite his reservations that its time to sh t or get off the pot jimmy proposes to anne very badly nanne refuses which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather peter ustinov dies and leaves a very specific video will njimmy stands to inhereit 100 million if he is married by 6 05 p m on his 30th birthday stays married for 10 years and produces a child nthere are only a couple of minor problems 1 jimmys 30th birthday is the next day 2 anne is nowhere to be found meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many exgirlfriends nits a wacky brewsters millionsesque premise acknowledged as such in one of the films better more selfaware lines of dialogue the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters nat least that would be the case if jimmy werent already a worldclass altruist nscreenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will if jimmy doesnt get married not only will he lose all the money but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him costing hudreds of jobs nfrom the outset jimmys motivation isnt cash its the livelihoods of his devoted employees nits almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelors plot development nby any human standard the guy is impossibly selfless nand thats the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness ntheres never any tension between the two starcrossed lovers because theres no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake nthe blandly nice odonnell couldnt pull off a randy cad if he tried so the filmmakers dont even let him zellwegers anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to but no one dares make her anything but the woman lightly wronged nand forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation nthe parade of sitcom set pieces had better be damned funny since theyre all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion nill admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing including ustinovs rantings about procreation and a restaurant fulltobursting with men popping questions and champagne corks nfar more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly like the shudderinducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortunehunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church nyoure never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor but thats not the real problem nnor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warmnfuzzy conclusion its leading up to nthe problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warmnfuzzy theres no spark no energy no humanity nits an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumers digestions nweve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment dont even have a pulse nthe bachelor is love among the mannequins n
 with all that education you should know what happiness is nstarring sylvia chang teresa hu hsu ming li lieh mao hsuehwei directed by edward yang written by yang and wu nienchen cinematography by christopher doyle and chang huikung nevery country has eventually its new wave nfrance had its nouvelle vague brazil its cinema novo china its fifth generation and on and on nsome waves just take longer than others before they wash over us cleansing us with the balm of discovery ntaiwans new wave came in the 1980s in the work of directors like hou hsiaohsien wan jen and edward yang that day on the beachyangs first featureis central nit created a new language for young taiwanese directors even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering nlater works refined the techniques that yang first explored here giving taiwan a distinctive international presence nthat day itself is long and frustrating the document of a nations attempt to find a voice nit does not lack ambition nit anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan in the manner of antonioni elaborating the alienation that the westernized whitecollar middleclass feel as their lives are shaped by oldfashioned rolesdedicated career men loyal housewivesthat they find unfulfilling njiali sylvia chang is the focus but the film brings others into its compassher husband her brother friends from her college daysas it charts her discontents nno one is happy njiali married her husband welei at a young age nat the time her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage despite his affection for another woman and so jialis marriage seemed in comparison a good one she chose welei of her own free will they loved each other nbut it goes wrong nthat day dutifully presents all the clich s welei becomes absorbed in his career indulges in an affair with a coworker jiali feels restless and trapped bound by a choice she made while young but which no longer seems wise nthe film never redeems these clich s by conveying the feel of authentic experience the intensity of lived pain and much of it seems trite and belaboured nit unfolds awkwardly as a series of flashbacks told during a luncheon in vienna where jiali meets her brothers old flame teresa hu now a concert pianist whom she has not seen since college nboth women seem rather sad and resigned to their sadness ntheir circumstances and those of jialis brother and a college friend suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choicesmarried the wrong man chosen the wrong career path etc but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate nit is not that jiali married the wrong man she didnt nthe problem is that she needed to marry at alland that if she did not marry she would still be just as unhappy nfor a woman in modern taiwan that day tells us the cards are stacked the dice are loaded she can play the game but the house always wins nthe films sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan nseen now it does not seem provocative nindeed its hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy it may be ambitious it may be innovative but it is also terribly terribly dull nand what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others and his use of those methods is fumbling uncertain undisciplined nnor does he bring anything newother than the localeto the material nthere are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives forin a young couples first kiss in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husbands mistressbut they are brief ntoo often yang devotes needless time to mundane scenesgrocery shopping flowerarrangingin which nothing happens little is said no emotion imparted nperhaps if the film were content to focus on such reflective inward moments leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings it might have been ambiguous suggestive insinuating nbut jiali and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence they talk about their problems at length in detail redundantly and eliminate all subtleties nat two hours and fortyfive minutes it all seems exorbitantly long indulgently longwinded nconsider the defining moment for jiali the titular day on the beach nthe thrust of the whole film explains easily enough what we are to think of that moment what it means when she walks away from a particular situation neven so the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally in case we may have missed the point nneedless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed and that is the problem throughout nthe look of the film is as tedious as the drawnout narrative nit was the first feature shot by christopher doyleat least its his name in the creditswho is now rightly regarded as one of the worlds leading cinematographers nin the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong karwai he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image nyou would never know it from watching that day which due either to doyles inexperience or yangs humdrum direction is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible nin scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience but none of the damage none of the heartbreak n
so ask yourself what 8mm eight millimeter is really all about nis it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography nis it about the business itself how bubbling just beneath the surface of bigtown americana theres a sordid world of sick and depraved people who wont necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires nor is it about those who can those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see nim not talking about snuff films supposed documentaries of victims being brutalized and killed on camera nim talking about films like 8mm and its director joel schumacher nwith a recent run of big budget movies to his credit batman robin a time to kill batman forever the client schumacher certainly has that kind of influence nis 8mm something you really want to see nprobably not nthe first twothirds of 8mm unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama albeit with a particularly unsavory core nthen as its been threatening all along the film explodes into violence nand just when you think its finally over schumacher tags on a ridiculous selfrighteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further ntrust me nthere are better ways to waste two hours of your life nnicolas snake eyes cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husbands safe documents a young girls murder nwelles goes about his assignment rather matteroffactly and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly almost as if you dont need any specialized skills or training to do this nwelles certainly makes it look easy nand cops obviously never look in toilet tanks for clues nthe deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes like george c scott in paul schraders hardcore noccasionally a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector reminding him of his unpleasant task nthere are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife played by catherine keener who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly splitlevel home in harrisburg pa n 8mm doesnt condemn or condone its subject matter it just exploits it nthe irony of course is that schumacher and seven scribe andrew kevin walkers vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an rrated firstrun hollywood product nso we only see snippets of snuff and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror nlater its the turn of joaquin phoenix whos quite good and by far the films most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again nall this to get to the familiar yet offensive revelation that sexual deviants are not indeed monsters but everyday people like you and me nneither super nor standard 8mm is shocking only in its banality n
capsule not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman robin but still horribly putrid cheesy and illconceived nthis one belongs in saturday morning cartoons nextended review you know about halfway through this movie i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes youd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy hong kong style martial arts nbeautifully choreographed by robin shou who also plays liu kang the fight scenes are both mindblowing and graceful acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep nthis is what made the original so fun but unfortunately for the sequel we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson ninstead they got john r leonetti the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat nnot a good choice nwhile the fight scenes are brutal and eyepopping the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare nthe acting is subpar which i could endure if it were not for a the directors style b the special effects c the treatment of the story and characters na mr leonetti should go back to lighting in my opinion ni could say dozens of bad things about him he way overuses slowmotion he has no eye for action he cant get even mediocre performances out of actors and so on nbut by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping napparantly everybody can now fly nhell im all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot but not when it happens every few minutes and is done so poorly nbetter jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena warrior princess nin short they should have gotten paul anderson back nor at least let robin shou direct nb unlike the first one whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic mk as special effects are bland fake looking and overall just plain bad ni counted at least half a dozen times that bluescreening was painfully obvious nhad this movie been made in the 80s it would have been groundbreaking nbut in todays industry it doesnt even look finished nc now for the really bad parts ni admit im an avid fan of the mortal kombat series nthe games are amusing diversions an easy way to work off stress and anger nthe first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride nthis could have been a really cool movie nit isnt nthe writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers nsome of the plot elements are just plain stupid nhow stupid ntake for instance how our heroes move around nthey use giants spheres the roll around underground supposedly at thousands of miles per hour oh nboy neven worse is the treatment of secondary characters nblink and youll miss em nmost characters had more depth in the video games nif you thought batman robin was bad about this you aint seen nothin yet na good 75 of the characters are introduced kick somebody around a bit then either die or are forgotten about ntheres no explanation at all for this nand for the final blasphemy the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie lasted about 3 minutes and then just sort of ended nit almost made me weep nto sum it all up rent it on video and fastforward through everything except the fight scenes n
years ago robin williams made jumanji a brilliant achievement in special effects but a travesty on nearly every other level nthe same can be said for what dreams may come a boring illogical weepiewannabe that left my senses numb ndont get me wrong i love breathtaking special effects and pulsepounding imagery nbrazil is on my personal top ten nthe city of lost children is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios ni even love 2001 and last year at marienbad being in the minority amidst my friends nwhat dreams may come imagery aside has little daring thought to complement its imagery nthe daring thought it does have is never fully realized nits idea of a plot is so lukewarm that it insults the bigger questions it raises nit would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences put on an electronica soundtrack and sell it as one of those popular minds eye videos nrobin williams plays chris nielsen who dies too prematurelynot only in the story but before we have a chance to really know and care for him nthe director vincent ward and the screenwriter ronald bass have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife nbig mistake nit would have been far better to take the halfhour or so needed to tell his life story first ala its a wonderful life so that i can build up respect for him so i could know and possibly care for him his children and his longsuffering wife played superbly by annabella sciorra ninstead the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses nit doesnt nso in the afterlife chris learns that a people still dont meet god b that our thoughts are reality and c time does not exist there nhmm nill grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative n the not meeting god part still irks at me but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect nthat said this alternate reality still makes no possible sense nread on nchris wife commits suicide nsince suicides go to hell chris would be separated from his wife forever nthe important question is is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love ngood question nand i like good thoughtprovoking questions ni dont like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question ni loathe it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously ni really loathe it when its story is no longer run by logic but by special effects nhey chris did you forget nyour thoughts are real nthey are more real than the physical world according to the newage screenplay nso why dont you conjure up positive thoughts of annie and let that run wild nand then she would appear before you and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity nbecause there would be no movie thats why nand albert the angel played by miscast cuba gooding jr says bluntly thats fantasy numm nif your thoughts are more real than the physical then fantasy is not fantasy but real nsurely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that nand if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person and that your thoughts arent big enough to sustain you for eternity well in all due respect thats why i dont subscribe to this theology nall due respect nanother idea based on time pause does not exist here nso chris spend your eternity with annie as she is on earth reliving your favorite memories or hang out with her when she was growing up nyouve got eternity perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out nand forcing her to write i still exist in her diary imo is just too tacky nthere are many other ideas all of which are a hundred times better than whats unraveled in the plot nthe great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before and just come out stale nmost insulting is the subplot where important people in chris life appear in heaven differently than he expects so when they finally show themselves he realizes they were with him all along nand when this happens the film runs in slow motion as if to build emotion ngag me with a spoon nso the only things for me to like are sciorras effective performance who rises far above this mundane material and the special effects nplease note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals i did not enjoy all of them some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe everybody floating up and down in invisible strings nit sounds like a joke but its really true i really tried to block out the dialogue and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack nmy vote goes to a rare cd called never say die 1981 from petra a christian rock group nits pretty good and they have a song about annie who commits suicide n its too late for annieshes gone away for goodtheres so much wed have told herand now we wish we couldbut its too late nmelancholic yes ndepressing yes nbut far more entertaining nso in case you dont know let me be straight nsuicidebad ndont do it nno no no got it you nshouldnt have to pay 7 50 to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest n
i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year when matthew perry had just signed on nim big fan of perrys subtle sense of humor and in addition i think chris farleys onedge extreme acting was a riot nso naturally when the trailer for almost heroes hit theaters i almost jumped up and down na soda in hand the lights dimming i was ready to be blown away by farleys final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perrys big breakthrough ni was ready to be just amazed for this to be among farleys best in spite of david spades absence ni was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran nsadly none of this came to pass nthe humor is spotty at best with good moments and laughable oneliners few and far between nperry and farley have no chemistry the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade for its his type of humor and not at all what perry is associated with nand the movie tries to be smart a subject best left alone when its a farley flick nthe movie is a major dissapointment with only a few scenes worth a first look let alone a second nperry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie and not surprisingly the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley nand farleys classic humor is widespread too nalmost heroes almost works but misses the wagontrain by quite a longshot nguys lets leave the exploring to lewis and clark huh nstick to tommy boy and well all be friends n
this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film nno one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story nhowever even if one thinks of it as fiction the prince of egypt remains shallow nbut ill begin from the beginning nthe biggest difference between the original biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero nmaybe its just me but if i knew i had god on my side id have a little bit more confidence nthere are other differences as well such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoahs death like its nothing but a thing nmost of all though the storys focus has shifted nrather than being a story about fatherson manethnicity mangod the prince of egypt is almost solely about the brotherbrother relationship between rameses and moses ni was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie where it came off as maudlin nrameses and moses squabble like children and then in the interests of peace moses saves rameses butt even though moses was the one who started it n yawn i didnt care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer which of course never happened in the original story moses was exiled nbut enough about the differences nlets talk about the movie itself nit features a moses who in the interests of making the character more human lacks any divinity whatsoever which isnt convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is nit features a cookiecutter iwannapleasedada rameses who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes from schindlers list among other things nthe film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the newimproved miriam voiced by the everantsy sandra bullock even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason here bullock is replaced by a singing voice nspeaking of which it contains very annoying music nit contains shallow writing nit features extraordinary animation which is one good thing i can say about this film nmost of all it contains an attempt to commercialize homogenize and massmarket a story about a manifestation of god ni am not christian but i got the impression of blasphemy nthe writers and producers took a butcher knife and chopchopped into the story n
janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker nthis is a bythebooks movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs nit also jumps on the everpopular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there too ngarofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator jay o sanders running for reelection ndenis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent thats made the kennedy family so popular nso leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit nshe soon learns why easier said than done is the mantra of movies like this nthe matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland almost misses the bus to town cant get a hotel room ends up in the smallest trashiest one around has a dog piss on her luggage and so on nthen comes what roger ebert calls the meet cute nit happens in every romance the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional cinematic way nin the matchmaker it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean david ohara in the bathtub his dog sitting at his side nno points for guessing its the same dog that just made water on her luggage nalso no points for guessing garofalo hates ohara on sight nthats how it works in movies like these ni know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that shed hate him for awhile then succumb to his charms live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil after which theyd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits ni havent mentioned the movies twist yet ngarofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss nmilo oshea who looks like an irish tom snyder is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together nrest assured hell do all he can to match up garofalo and ohara noh and in keeping with the matchmakers utter predictability he dies toward the end nwhat the message here nsometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction like garofalo will sell out with a weak script ni was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie but they actually only have two or three scenes together nleary stays stateside for the most part yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole nhe even undoes himself with the old microphones still on after hes done giving the speech cliche nboth of them should have known better n
well i guess its that time of the year again nthe one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even try writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions nits also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases nin america they call this time summer and it happens once every year nand maybe its the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it but in the process normally weak insipid lines like consider this a divorce hasta la vista baby and youre the disease nim the cure actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs nthis is not entirely a bad thing of course nwhat am i talking about nim talking about the summer blockbusters the action thrillers the thisobviouslycostalotsoyouknow everyonesgoingtogo explosions gas threats flying saucers and special effects nin the rash of my what big guns you have but wait nmine are bigger movies there are also the usual boymeetsfishandsavesenvironment movies or whale whatever and this year the odd crop of savetheworldfromaliensorenvironment threats offerings nim talking about the three batmans the speeds the terminators etc this year im talking about twister independence day the arrival the rock mission impossible and of course eraser nhere in singapore as our local movie critics like to whine we seem to get the pick of the crop of my explosion is more reallooking than yours movies but nothing else nmission impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us nthe same goes for eraser which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called mission unavoidable on account of its worldwide megaadvertising blitz eraser seems like a cheaper less thoughtful imitation nthats saying a lot because mi the movie was already a cheap thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the 60s70s nin eraser arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger nhe does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and resituating them with new identities nhis new case is lee cullen played by vanessa williams who unlike all the other scumbags hes ever relocated is an actual real life honest person nbecause shes so good and has such nice legs arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from his killers nlee obtains evidence that the hightechnology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated blackmarket arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair nof course as the formula goes her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck there are people in high places who will go down with this because yes this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world that is america since watergate nin protecting lee arnold is framed by the mentorturnedevil robert deguerin nicely played by james caan and ends up having to prove that he isnt the one killing the programmes witnesses in addition to making sure lee isnt accidentally torpedoed to death by the new green guns his enemies all have nits around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission impossible theme because arnies mission includes breaking into a highsecurity building to run a disk ni guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about nits an electromagnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles and which can see through walls nit has some sort of xray vision so its user can target the victims heart even from great distances ndespite this which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun though im certainly no expert however arnold whose own heart is targeted a number of times never goes flying 10 feet backwards with a twofoot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun ninstead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous ill be back nlike everyone else in the theater i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily nalthough there is a lot of violence in this movie not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators i recommend this movie to most over18s who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas nreviews rating system wait for the video n a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha n pretty good bring a friend n amazing potent stuff n perfection nsee it twice n

drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside the one whos the awkward klutz or the spunky doityourselfer the one who just doesnt fit in with the others nshe has perfected these characters in movies such as the wedding singer and most notably ever after nnow shes back starring in what could be called a modernday cinderella fable never been kissed nyou know its a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary ntrust me on this one no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg and i dont mean steve invented the printing press nthe premise is simple nbarrymores josie geller at 25 the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago suntimes is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what todays teens are feeling and doing njosie she says she was named after the 70s cartoon character was a geek in high school so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance nthis time she thinks she will get it right and be accepted by the incrowd nnow what kind of adult with a good job and a successful career would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was and is high school and adolescence nthese are among the many problems that plague never been kissed nscreenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get a handle of josie ntheir script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy blubbering womanchild at the least provocation nand the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high schools most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability nok so never been kissed is not a sociological expose of todays high school scene nhowever certain rules should apply to film and one of those is consistency of character namong the movies problems is the illconceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and in the process lose focus on her assignment nany competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say get me rewrite nto be fair barrymore is very appealing but she is given very little to work with nshe tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character but the script continually undermines her nbarrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk talk and act like a cool hip high schooler notherwise she is left foundering on a cliched sea of teenage stereotypes and situations n never been kissed is entertaining and funny in fits and starts nit lacks consistency and a firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish nthe movies main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys the outsider who befriends new student josie njosie sees a lot of her former self in aldys yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls nreal mature nand that is the main deficiency with never been kissed nits illogical unrealistic uneven and undemanding nit has some warm and humorous spots but not enough to overcome its many obstacles n
i can imagine how good krippendorfs tribe must have looked on paper nit does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director todd holland all wanted to make this film nin fact it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorfs tribe as possible nin retrospect i can imagine how bad this film could have been ni shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss ndreyfuss plays james krippendorf an anthropologist who is granted 100 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea nhalfway into his twoyear expedition his wife apparently dies ni say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established nlater we find out that much of the grant money was spent on bigscreen tvs and other such pleasures nso when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely he decides to construct an elaborate lie nhe makes his own tribe using his three children as actors in a video nhe simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe which he calls the shelmickedmu naudiences at krippendorfs lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision nand proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community nlike all films like this the lie becomes more and more complex and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero ndreyfuss is a funny talented man and he is funny in this film nhe has lots of positive energy and unlike most comical actors really manages to play people like this realistically nthis film also requires a lot of physical humor that ive never seen dreyfuss perform and he does a great job njenna elfman who plays veronica mecilli a scientist who wants in on krippendorfs work is also very funny and appealing here nand the kid actors are great as well nbut were talking about the script from hell nthis is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen nbut the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it nall the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew nno the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and meanspirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched nfurthermore the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless ntake for instance the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex nthey get all decked out in the tribe getup complete with paint to darken their skin nkrippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe nnow i saw this scene coming from a mile away but i said to myself no that would be far too tasteless ntheres no way theyll do that oh ngod nthey did do it nits there ni was almost more appalled by the fact that this didnt bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film ni found it deplorable nand when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice nthe film is filled with scenes like these nthey not only insult the audience but they insult the types of people that the film portrays nit would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon nand watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining but i think that most members of the onscreen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes nif i were an anthropologist this film would insult me immensely nmoving right along the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes nsure dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny and it allows for some entertaining scenes but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes nit is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film nhis character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does ni suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case but for the purposes of good taste i would have expected something nno this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues and the writer of the film charlie peters didnt include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad nin fact its his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing and he continually shrugs off her warnings ni suppose its important to admit that this is a funny film ndreyfuss and elfman and many of the contrived and insulting scenes add up to a picture that is anything but boring nand if youre less serious than i you probably will enjoy it ni however cant get past these elements nkrippendorfs tribe is being marketed as a family comedy but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldnt be learning nwith a little more insight into its story and themes this could have been a good movie n
an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer nyou may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder its hollywood existence nwhen i think of the screenwriters behind this film i picture a room full of monkeys nthe monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves nall of the monkeys combine their efforts hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clarks office nthe designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clarks desk while flailing his arms and shrieking nthe director appears to be deep in thought until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims i love it nthe writing behind this project is embarrassing nfor your amusement i will explain the plot ndr kinder kathleen turner and dr heep christopher lloyd are two of the coldhearted executives at the baby geniuses institute where peculiar studies are going on nas the story goes there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ages 2 and under know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences nwhen they move past this phase they become like any other drooling toddler nkinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies namely little sylvester sly for short who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission impossible team nthere is so much crap derived from this premise despite the fact its virtually identical to the plot in look whos talking n a far superior film in any league nyou will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene nsylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kungfu tactics nquestion its obvious the babies are supersmart but why are they able to fight like jackie chan nthe adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers nits a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes familiar home alone formula ni also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90s knowledge quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors nthe effects in baby geniuses similar to the talking animals in babe are pathetic the editing is a disaster and the jokes are never funny nthe only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are cute ni suppose they are ni can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute nother instances though i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script nthere are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever their entire existence is based on punch lines npeter macnicol and kim cattrall as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvesters twin are both miscast nthen again i dont suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid nmeanwhile dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench hahaha ni would avoid baby geniuses at all costs ninstead of watching this i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling nor perhaps you would consider going diving in sharkinfested waters nanything to avoid this painful movie nthe final line in the film spoken by the bratty sylvester is if they think im doing the sequel for less than 20 mill theyre nuts nsequel nplease have mercy n
exuniversal soldier luc has to battle a group of newermodel engineered fighters gone bad nthe review njeanclaude van damme has a oneliner early on in universal soldier the return his latest attempt to remain relevant that sums up this entire movie he says been there done that nno film critic could possibly sum up van dammes recent film choices any better nwhile other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him martial arts and guns nthis unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex nhe joins fellow martial artistaction star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away nuniversal soldier the return is truly poor nthe plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade specifically terminator 2 judgement day and the similarly named soldier nsoldiers kurt russell was an older model supersoldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors for the good of a planet schwarzeneggers terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine the t1000 and jeanclaude a former universal soldier has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of you guessed it newer model soldiers nconsidering the poor box office performance of soldier its amazing that this project was ever given the goahead nluc devereaux van damme was the sole remaining universal soldier or unisol for short until he was returned to a normal if muscular human form nin this sequel technically the fourth film in the series following two straighttovideo duds that were ignored here plotwise luc is now a human trainerconsultant of sorts for the unisol program nworking with dylan cotner xander berkeley who interestingly also appeared in t2 the unisol program has engineered a tougher fiercer fighting force with the help of supercomputer seth nunfortunately upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government seth takes control of his soldiers killing everyone in the building except for luc his partner maggie his daughter hillary and erin a reporter trapped inside nthe rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive while beating up a group of nearindestructible soldiers most notably romeo popular wrestler goldberg nthere are lots of fights gun battles lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility nthere are so many clich s in this film that it is almost painful to watch nluc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on and in the course of a single night they go from bickering to falling for each other to kissing nerin is a patheticallywritten character people are getting brutally gunned down all around her and yet not only does this not seem to frighten her but she finds time to remind luc that she isnt leaving without her story nwhatever nother laughable moments include a luc going to a strip club to get internet access what and b a group of rangers who after having been given good advice luc tells them that their weapons are useless and shows them a specific gun which should work better choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway guess who wins the battle nnot one single scene in universal soldier the return has any originality to it nwhen fuelled by don davis loud driving music score the films many fights become almost passable but mostly are full of the same ol jeanclaude moves ndirector mic rodgers a former stunt coordinator keeps the action coming at a rapid pace with only a few token serious moments to be found nhis past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion nif only jeanclaude werent getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li rodgers could probably have made a decent action film nto place the blame squarely at van dammes feet however is an injustice nim not sure that anyone not even robert deniro or edward norton could make writers william malone and john fasanos script sound good none particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access nhe cringes looks down and mutters uh uhm nthey all do i saw it on 60 minutes neh he he he the scripts and indeed the entire films only saving grace is goldberg nhe chews up every scene he is in obviously enjoying his role immensely nhe even gives the film a few laughs as he mutters things like i really dont like that guy every time he fails to kill luc nsadly his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier the return into anything better than a belowaverage action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straighttovideo n
american pie 2 is filled with laughs nbut they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater nim no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy nbut the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself nwhat separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart nof the original i noted it was a warm pleasant outing about the travails of growing up nwell the quartet of chums jim jason biggs oz chris klein kevin thomas ian nicholas and finch eddie kaye thomas have grown up nat least they are a year older but dont seem any wiser nfresh from their first year of college the quartet along with the obnoxious stifler seann william scott rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score nas usual nothing goes right until the last reel nbut what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women nand american pie 2 is rather degrading to women nfor the most part they are not shown as individuals nthey are nothing more than potential recipients of overactive raging hormones nit is telling that the most normal couple oz and heather mena suvari spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex shes overseas on an exchange student program ndespite having been to college jim is still klutzy and awkward unsure of himself around the opposite sex nmost of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him including a painful episode involving an instant gluelike substance nalso uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates whom the boys suspect of being lesbians nit is offensive and plays upon outdated adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs nthe first film despite some raunchy moments had an innocent charm to it nthe sequel is more cynical nit knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them the many mentions of finchs encounter with stiflers mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levys return as jims wellmeaning tryingtobehip dad nthe only performer who is actually given some new fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle the band geek from the original nin the sequel she imbues her character with vulnerability wisdom and maturity namerican pie 2 is a presold commodity that will earn several million at the box office nit is a shame though that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz who also penned the original could not have set his sights higher namerican pie 2 is funny but its still a comedown as well as a letdown n
