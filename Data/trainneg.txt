arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar go to the movies fall in love move in together etc nreview nwell if you havent seen when harry met sally or he said she said or if you dont watch love war on television you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages nhowever if youve seen any of these than you have seen most of this film nthis of course doesnt mean its bad nsome of it is amusing but overall i just had to ask whats the point narye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love nkevin pollack is the stereotypical femalefearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes most if which werent very funny ncouteney cox is the stereotypical careerminded woman who falls in love njulie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman n notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical nthis film uses a lot of formula the plot is basically known from the opening credits nso what is good about the movie nwell as i said there are a few amusing moments nsurprisingly julie brown who i usually find just plain goofy was the best thing in the film nalso there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual ngee this is really short nnot much to say about the film really nit is just kind of there nwatching it on video might not be a complete waste of time but i wouldnt recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre n

this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bonts debut as a director 1994 surprise hit speed nbut the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead nannie sandra bullock is in the wrong place at the wrong time again nshes going on a cruise with her new boyfriend alex jason patric and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger willem dafoe who has a bone to pick with the shipping line nthey sacked him after he got sick nnow he wants the diamonds stored in the ships safe for compensation nthat actually is the whole storyline nspeed 2 could do without dialogues nthe movie is all about images and remarkable sound ni dont really know why this is called an action movie nexcept for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies nfirst we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie nthen desaster strikes nsandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around ni looked for the action but couldnt find it nmost of the time she is part of the decoration nthe only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door nnow we know that she can handle a chain saw nwe also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds nthe bomb defusal of course goes wrong but only the furniture is damaged not our heroes who still are needed njason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie helping other passengers and frolicking in the water nhis initial seasickness is suddenly gone because there are ship crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger nhe does a pretty good job but i cant blame keanu reeves for declining this part nthen theres willem dafoe the villain who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankensteins monster nhe doesnt succeed though nan untidy appearance isnt enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential nbefore he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror ni cant really recommend speed 2 you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that arent meant to be funny nespecially the showdown when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat nthere you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie nin keeping with last years desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death na really funny and meant to be funny scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision nsome crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie nhad they looked out the window they wouldnt have missed the huge ship racing toward them nthose of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects nin an adequately equipped theater its as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate nbut the ilm special effects cant save the movie nfor all the money they could have done better n
jet li busted onto the american action movie scene when he stole the show in 1998s lethal weapon 4 with his wicked looks his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma nit only took another two years for megaproducer joel silver to set him up in an allamerican movie primed to take over some of the empty actionhero seats left by alleged cokehead van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal nwould this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts namely chow yunfat and jackie chan nlets find out nplot rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another when members of their respective families start turning up dead nthats when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brothers death and to exact some of his own style of revenge ncritique three words not enough action nsimple enough nnot enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay bad actors crappy dialogue and ohso many overthetop melodramatic moments nand a romance angle nwhy one must ask why ni love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences and jet well the poor dude was barely in the movie nand i thought this was supposed to be his big break nhow bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kungfu fighting chops slap him in a few more scenes and give him more chances to practice his actingenglish abilities nwhat a letdown neven black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up empty shell of a film nin fact i am sure that more time was spent gathering the hits for the soundtrack of this film than were on the socalled screenplay ni felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time nthe sad part about the bad script is that it wouldnt matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines nbut no save lindo and aaliyah who werent too shabby i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly nand what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15year old looking guy acting like hes the overlord of a drug ring nwhat a mess nthen again i dont want it to seem like im complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway not the story nwell i guess thats what disappointed me the most out of this film nthere were a couple of cool fight scenes with li but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving nalso as much as i love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt nit should be seamless fellas not necessarily against the laws of gravity nthe one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow but that simple creative touch couldnt save the rest of this films uninteresting plot movements nim disappointed for jet li that this film didnt give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes nhopefully the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor nfor now i just hope that for his sake the films title isnt a premonition of the movies ultimate fate at the boxoffice n

reading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy analyze this i asked myself how could this miss nrobert de niro taxi driver raging bull billy crystal city slickers lisa kudrow the opposite of sex and director harold ramis national lampoons vacation nthese are usually reliable filmmakers well okay crystal has been in a sizable slump lately and tellingly the first halfhour of analyze this was very funny nunfortunately as the running time ticked away i began to think that the first thirty minutes had unbeknownst to me been rewound and were being replayed another twoandahalf times nthe film has obtained a clever premise but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen nmiddleaged psychoanalyst ben sobels billy crystal life is finally going very well nalthough he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents especially his father who is also a psychiatrist ben has an easygoing teenage son kyle sabihy and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend laura lisa kudrow nin little but a flash however ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti robert de niro who desperately wants counseling even though he himself wont even admit to having anxiety attacks nben tries to help paul mostly so he will get him off his back but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death nit seems to ben that no matter what he does paul vitti will not go away and the more they become involved the more bens potentially happy life gets into danger n analyze this has a few laughs sprinkled throughout mostly in the first half but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan ramis and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106minute running time nadmittedly de niro is very funny here and i cant remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him and crystal is in topform but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them including a substantial plotline nsince analyze this bills not one not two but three writers youd think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws but they must have all been on autopilot none of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters all of which have next to nothing to do and arent even given multidimensional characters to attempt to develop ncoming off of her oscarcaliber work in two of last years best films clockwatchers and the opposite of sex lisa kudrows throwaway girlfriend role is an incredible step down nsure kudrows fellow friend jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in office space but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston nkudrow meanwhile mostly just stands around no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place nchazz palminteri as rival gangster primo fares even worse in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character nfinally molly shannon rising film star and cast member on saturday night live has a rousingly hilarious onescene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystals patients and then completely disappears ntoo bad considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal nonce analyze this approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrows laura standing alone at the altar once again i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most ben nafterwards the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul became a real laughfree deadzone losing its last remaining comic punches n analyze this proves that talent can certainly help any film out but when the written material isnt up to their level what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air n
 the world on land its just too big for me nstarring tim roth pruitt taylor vince bill nunn clarence williams iii nrated r nthe legend of 1900s is the years most absurd movie a rambling nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast nit stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth looking wistful as ever as a guy named n1900 nyou heard right nhis name is in all actuality 1900 nhe was born on an ocean liner on 111900 uh hence the name abandoned and adopted by danny a ship crewman n1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of dannys fear that he might be taken away from him because of visa matters nwell when 1900 is about 9 or so he starts wondering all around the ship none day he discovers a grand piano nhe sits down and starts playing nmiraculously what comes out is beautiful na group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age nwhen one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is totally against regulations 1900 replies f ck the regulations nho ho ho n1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land nwhen hes about 30ish and can play the piano like nobodys business onboard comes another musician nhis name is max pruitt taylor vince and he plays the trumpet nafter 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm he sits him down on the piano next to him takes the pianos braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall taking them with it nhow the chair theyre sitting on and the piano dont separate i dont know but this apparently isnt the kind of thing were supposed to ask nafter that 1900 and max become friends nmax is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land but 1900 has no intention of doing so nwhats more he doesnt even want his music to go anywhere without him when a record company hears about his talents they come on board to make a record of his music but after finding out that gasp n theyre going to make millions of copies he breaks the record nthe conflict of the movie is that after max unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship gets off himself he stumbles upon a record of 1900s music in a store nthe record shouldnt exist because a 1900 never stepped on dry land and b the one record that was made on the ship was broken nladies and gentlemen its a mystery nthe story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements nwere supposed to be roused by a climactic npiano duel nthere isnt anything in this movie with the potential to compel n1900 comes off as a whiny brooding extremely unlikable man i cant recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo meditation on life nditto for max who doesnt seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900 ntim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf theres no spirit no gusto to the character nhe insists that he leads a happy life on the ship but to us he is dead npruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit nthe highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant leering king of jazz who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel nthe legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many nthis effort is utterly limp and lifeless nat once ridiculous boring narrowsighted and pointless this is one movie that should be and will be quickly forgotten n
let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years ni am not too fond of ted turners world championship wrestling however and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight nthe plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs david arquette aptly cast as a neandrathal and sean dawkins scott caan who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show nwhen they finally get to see their hero wcw world champion jimmy king played by oliver platt ni personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair a wasted palitaliano in a role originally meant for reallife wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back nwhen they find him they discover in horror that jimmy kings real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv nking is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king nafter convincing king that they dont care that his persona isnt real gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcws payperview ngee whiz there are so many things wrong with this movie i dont know where to begin nyes i do n1 the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff wcw president who thought up this project thinks of wrestling fans nhe thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously nhe actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously ni got news for you eric nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that this is 2000 you know not 1985 ni know hell probably cover arguments up by saying it isnt meant to be taken seriously but it is because thats how big an ego bischoff has n2 there was a documentary made in 1998 wrestling with shadows that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation vince mcmahons screwing bret the hitman hart out of the title nthis movies storyline is basically a comic ripoff of that plot with the poor mans wayne and garth thrown in neric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart n3 nthe movies main wrestler jimmy king has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him nno wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age we want bad asses today n4 why make this a comedy instead of an emotional rockystyle drama ni know wrestling isnt a sport but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end n5 nin the movie gordie starts up an illfated romance with nitro girl sasha the lovely rose mcgowan nwhat she sees in that freak marilyn manson ill never understand only to find that she has hospitalized kings trainer for sinclair nwouldnt it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spygirlforthebadguy cliche ni hate that n6 nlast but certainly not least there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen nor did i laugh once either nthe world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie for these reasons n1 theyre the better promotion n2 they have better and younger talent performers and wrestlers n3 nthey give their fans what they want and dont treat them like idiots n4 theyre winning the ratings and theyre the promotion everybody cares about n5 simply put they could make a movie a hundred times better and they could do a wrestling movie the right way nthe only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end nand if i spoiled it for you good i saved you from wasting seven dollars n

 deep rising gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squidlike menace but the unfolding story is artificial silly and almost completely derivative of countless other and for the most part better films nwhile dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures take for example the schlocky mountain highs of last springs anaconda deep rising has no tongue to put in its cheek nfolks were only a month into the new year and already heres a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases nmost of the action takes place on the argonautica a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage uhoh if these people had seen titanic then maybe theyd have known to stay home when its attacked by a giant tentacled sea creature nthe only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian famke janssen argonautica owner canton anthony heald and a few other crew members na mercenary team lead by resourceful captain john finnegan treat williams board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby nbut what their search of the ship uncovers is something bloodsoaked hungry and not very helpful nthe main problem with deep rising is its overt familiarity the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most scifihorror films in recent memory nthe concept is leviathan meets titanic with a dash of speed 2 thrown in for good or is that bad nmeasure nthis monster is equal parts 20 000 leagues under the sea and the relic knows how to open doors like the raptors from jurassic park and even gets to expel a halfdigested victim a neat effect admittedly a la the giant snake in anaconda nsome of the attack sequences are straight out of jaws and alien na scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of alien resurrection ntheres even a jet ski chase like hard rain nand the list goes on nwatching deep rising s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself because none of them have welldeveloped characters nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy nwilliams is affable enough but his finnegan just isnt believable nan interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted pretty famke janssen best known as goldeneye s killer thighs is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams while kevin j oconnor as finnegans mechanic provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast ndjimon honsou who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in decembers amistad pops up in a brief part nhe needs to stay away from the water nthe movies final shot is a groaner as is the 11thhour regurgitation of a subplot involving an onship saboteur nas if a cast deserving of their snack foodfate isnt bad enough when you taunt the monster youre really asking for it deep rising is a slow stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot nand since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is the closer we are to the end of the movie rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isnt out of the question n

running time approximately 1hr 40mins nreviewed by jack choo nrating nthe movie starts with a rather se7enish opening sequence rather cool and sets the mood for things to come nthe story propels the audience into a neoreality somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red nexistenz is actually the name of a new virtualreality game nsupposedly vr games are highly popular as is considered a legaldrug in this neoreality n leigh is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate gameexperience in the form of existenz nplayers are required to have bioports embedded in their spine which plugs to a gamepod in order to enjoy the immersive experience nduring a secretive betatestingcumteaser meeting for this new game an assassination attempt on life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard law n is more of a realists than anything else afraid that hell lose reality if he begin to play these games but requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt nas they soon discover they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected nexistenz has all the cronenberggore that is expected of him neven so this film is nowhere near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners nnot even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly nexistenz can probably be looked upon as his 90s version of videodrome even so it is a poor followup nwhile in most of his famed films his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot nin existenz the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of overindulgence than anything else njennifer jason leigh and jude law both commendable actors looked aloof and missdirected throughout the entire film nthe scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the bgrade category nit was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tightbudget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film the opening sequence though probably formed a considerable portion of the budget nwhich is actually quite good nexistenz is too predictable and cliched in these times n10 years ago it would have been another classic for cronenberg ncronenberg fans however those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you n

director of this film wants to show how important teenagers are and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible horrible world nand how does he show it nby really cheap surrealism and moronic exchanges like this noh and it gets better na similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of oh i dunno the fiftieth sex scene in this film im not counting the several masturbation scenes nin it one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another and he says to her something along the lines of do you ever wonder what life is all about nsorry man foreplay takes place before the act of coitus nof course what do you expect the film was written and directed by a guy who cant even spell his first name right yes i know its a cheap joke but it had to be done n the doom generation is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them and also as another teen angst film one of the slogans is teen is a fourletter word hardy har har nits a film about two angsty teens amy blue rose macgowan who would later play the buxom tatum in scream and jordon white james duval who would go on to play randy quaids son in independence day who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac xavier red jonathan schaech who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in that thing you do n and by the way do you get the symbolism nred white and blue nhuh nhuh and go on a road trip where three things happen in no order 1 they have sex 2 they run into weird people 3 they kill them nthe film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films ngregg araki obviously has seen such films as easy rider natural born killers and kalifornia and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide nbut what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper n the doom generation doesnt want to do this it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level nhe wants to show everything in a weird manner and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about nheres one scene an earlier scene in the film amy and jordan go into a quicke mart type place to get food and other stuff namy is smoking and the clerk an asian man mind you i love how racist this film is i really do tells her to put it out nshe tells him to fuck off or something to that note nhe points a shotgun at her and she puts it out reluctantly njordan makes two hot dogs and takes them to the counter nthe cash register rings up 6 66 n oh and this symbolism doesnt stop here njordan checks for his wallet but its really in the car nhe asks amy for it but she left her wallet in the car as well nthe clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money nthey say they dont have it nhe gets ready to kill them but then xavier who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before pops out of nowhere fights with the clerk and ends with him blowing the clerks head clean off clean wound mind you nthe head is shown flying through the air and lands in a fryer where it begins to scream ni dont really object to this kind of sick violence but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only to gross you out naraki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme hell make some kind of art nwrong nit takes a kind of resistance to make gore art nwhen george romero made dawn of the dead a very gory flick even for today he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick nsame goes for peter jacksons disgustingly gory dead alive which features a 30 minute long fest of blood guts dismemberments flesh chewing and other assorted stuff all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body taking out all sorts of zombies nit was sick but it was also satirical and controled na scene like this has no purpose in the film and it sticks out from everything else that happens nheres a couple other scenes jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches masturbates and then licks the semen from his hand xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window masturbates and falls backwards a man attacks the trio and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword put there just so this could happen a fast food employee stalks the trio and his arm is shot off by xavier and various other annoyances nalso look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people who probably didnt really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it just like peter otoole helen mirren malcolm macdowell and john gielgud probably didnt when they signed to be in caligula npeople such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel hollywood madam heidi fleiss christopher peter brady mcknight amanda bearse and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line nwhy are they here nso that we can all point to them and say hey look its fill in the blank nwow ngimme a break nthe films meaning is pretty easy to detect that you know teens are so precious and the world is such a horrible place that when the two entities collide theres a giant explosion of horrific violence notherwise defined as teen angst or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you nlook im 19 years old ni went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did nive since moved on to i dont really know what to do with my life phase but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks theyre dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse npart of being a teen is experimenting and testing the waters nits not whining about how awful parents are and purposely feeling dispondent nthis is what the characters in this film do and the film wants to show how theyre these great people who are being punished by the world because theyre teenagers and how they try to defend themselves but cant totally overcome them nits not their fault they kill people its the worlds nwhat they really need is a reality check nthe world is a bad place and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting nbut part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it nthe film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed and theres nothing they can do about it nhence the title nnot only does it have bad fallacy but it cant even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner neverythings overly surreal and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex nhow does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst nhow does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way nand why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film nif araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction hed show them for what they really are nand if he didnt want the satirical approach hed show the real problems with the world nand if you still dont think that the doom generation is incompetent on every single possible level it could be take the acting nrose macgowan is horrible nyes she proved herself talented in scream but shes so bad in the doom generation that if i had not seen her in scream i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today nher entire performance is onenote bitchy and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that its laughable nequally bad is jonathan schaech who wants to be the slacker serial killer someone who doesnt have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain nhis performance is annoying as hell and granted he was better in that thing you do nand then theres james duval nlets just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando nhe has the same kind of slacker stuttering only much much much worse and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him least talented actor in the world ni have seen lots of bad actors but james duval has got to be the worst nor at least somewhere up there nheres another example of a bad scene if youre still not convinced the film opens up in a club where theyre playing nine inch nails most banal song heresy example of the lines god is deadand no one caresif there is a hellill see you there and as the song plays and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing the film pans over to amy just standing there looking dispondent nthe film closes in on her she looks right at the camera and says fuck nno explanation of this should be necessary nand finally a note to gregg grow up nreally nmove out of your parents basement read something other than salinger and get a day job nand dont quit it n
once upon a time jeanclaude van damme was a decent action hero nthe muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films boasting his spectacular martialarts ability nsome of these excursions were fun nbut now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mindnumbing action nand when the action goes sour what is there left to enjoy nill explain nknock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong nmarcus ray van damme a babemagnet and stylish dresser heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner rob schneider nthey become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans seemingly by a mole in the business nim going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph so if you want a review devoid of spoilers skip onto the next one nim not quite sure who gives a crap but ill issue a warning anyhow ntommy is really working with the cia nhis boss a very hammy and flat paul sorvino is the mole and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons nhe even stoops so low to put them into childrens toys nif you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing then you probably will enjoy knock off nif you think that this ridiculous setup couldnt even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing this might not be your cup of tea nknock off sucks nit stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares nit amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something simply because van damme is the star nthe plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe ndirector tsui hark who teamed with van damme in the superior but still lamebrained double team is at the helm and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot ni suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous nthe picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence speeds are altered consistently and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired nit all sounds very cool ntrust me it isnt nas much as it scars me to say this har har van damme is terrible nsure he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease nhe looks like hes doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan and his performance is stiff and tired ni hate to say it but perhaps its time for mr van damme to give up his day job nits really a test of endurance watching knock off ni suppose theres some enjoyment derived from schneiders character who is extremely annoying but provides the films better moments nand what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie nhopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter nknock off doesnt even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film like a handful of van dammes others nno this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking nand considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department that is certainly not saying much nnote to self avoid universal soldier 2 the return upon release in august 99 n
synopsis a man whose lover paris was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system nthe subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend laura and becomes addicted to virtual reality which due to a design flaw in his unit recreates the dead paris ncomments virtual seduction executive produced by roger corman and lance h robbins serves as a cheaplymade precursor to strange days a far superior film nboth movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ab using technology to be with former lovers in strange days the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality ninterestingly both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium though strange days uses the setting far more effectively nthis exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction nits not bad for what it is lowbudget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality nunfortunately its been done before and since in much better films a fact which ultimately leaves the scifi fan bored by this movie nvirtual seduction has many faults one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins nthe films script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavyhanded and wooden as the movie progresses nmany important scenes seem too dark the lighting could have been improved significantly nthe cast a collection of veteran bmovie actors and sitcom regulars do only a mediocre job in their roles njeff fahey of the original lawnmower man convincingly though unenergetically plays the lead character ncarrie genzel plays paris the vr lover but ami dolenz as the current love interest seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality which doesnt lend credence to the films premise nmeschach taylor of the once popular designing women sitcom adequately plays a scientist working on the project but his performance isnt something to write home about either nvirtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background nin other words one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then but its rather boring to just sit and watch nthe movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from bmovies in this genre but it is still an adult rrated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt nthis turkey ultimately isnt awful but its not particularly interesting or unique either ndont be seduced into watching this movie unless youve got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch n
everyone knows that old rule never work with children and animals nin this latest horror flick mimic case its never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals instead as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience nthe film begins in new york where we see children dying from a mysterious disease which is being carried by cockroaches ndr susan tyler sorvino creates a genetically enhanced bug the judas breed however which is designed to kill all cockroaches nthe bug does its job the cockroaches all die and the terror is gone nthree years later appears on the screen and we discover that the judas breed is back bigger than ever and ready to kill nthe spin on this bug however is that it can mimic its predator and in this case its nhumans nthat should teach us for squishing all those bugs nwhat should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace nperhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking and trying to avoid the predator type movie it could easily have become nif it is then the director and writers have made the wrong move because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest nthe director who bought us cronos a far superior film directs the film in a calm and frankly dull movie nthere are few exciting sequences instead just a lot of people talking nif the dialogue was intelligent then it would be all right but its sadly babbling nonsense nin fact the script is embarrsingly weak and the characterizations not much better sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come with the script not bothering to develop them nthere is some action in this film but its directed in such an annoying way its just infuriating to watch nthe camera cuts all over the place disoreitating the audience and instead of involving the audience in the action it merely alienates them nthe peformances are o k if slightly below average nsorvino is o k although shes not very good at conveying terror or anything emotion really nthe supporting cast are all sterotypes with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth a geeky scientist with spectacles and what could be the most stereotypical mexican old timer ever ntheir reasonable good fun however nmimic then may fail with its story pacing and characters but the film does look good nlike dark city mimic is a definite case of style of content nit may be a bit too gloomy for its own good but the sets look nice and parts of the film are directed well nbut looks arent good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre somewhere where it shouldnt really belong na good opportunity then wasted na shame noverall rating review by david wilcock 1998 n
house on haunted hill 1999 starring taye diggs geoffrey rush ali larter famke janssen peter gallagher bridgette wilson max perlich lisa loeb james marsters and chris kattan ndirected by william malone written by dick beebe n house on haunted hill initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombielike mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible none doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck na nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water nthese mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous bhorror flicks with grunting noises and cadaverous movements nexcept this time at the end of the millenium the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be nin past horror films the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims n house on haunted hill doesnt want their audience to have an imagination everything is provided for them to watch and squirm not think nthis nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film n house on haunted hill which is based on the 1958 film of the same title introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can following the opening blood fest nthe film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot nthe aim here is to scare the audience with chilling unexpected shots of blood guts and mayhem nhowever the film is neither scary nor unpredictable nthe plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner geoffrey rush neach character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money nsince the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them nthe problem is that every character is not likable nthe two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer taye diggs who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ali larter nthe characters presented are so annoying and pathetic that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them nthe worst character in this film or maybe in any film released this year is chris kattans watson pritchett nhe spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself nwaiting for pritchett to die was a strenuously difficult act to sit through nthe most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price an homage to victor price who starred in the original nplaying the rich man who supposedly organized the party he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face nhowever rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price played by famke janssen nthe main problem is that house on haunted hill is not scary nto top off that huge disappointment every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous nif the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped similar to deep blue sea the goal for creating a creepy suspenseful action film was completely missed n

plot based on the wildly popular jerry springer tv show this movie follows the lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on the infamous program none posse comes from the trailer parks and are to be featured in the i slept with my stepfather segment and the other is based on some flygirl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted dog boyfriend ncritique the truth is that if i didnt have a day job i would probably watch the real jerry springer show every day ni find it quite entertaining despite its complete lack of redeeming value nhaving said that the show itself is outrageous funny and always filled with goofy surprises as opposed to this film which features no laughs is this a comedy or a drama uninteresting and completely unbelievable onedimensional stereotypes and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way ni never thought i would utter the word boring in the same sentence as jerry springer but this film is an absolute yawnfest despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs lesbians ta and tv violence who wouldve guessed that ni wish they would have either a made this movie much much funnier or b turned it into a complete drama and given us a real perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment nunfortunately it doesnt seem as though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching real jerry springer reruns to complete his script leaving us with a boring film featuring no laughs onedimensional characters and no fun whatsoever nlittle known facts about this film and its stars jerry springer used to be the mayor of cincinnati ohio nfor this film he won the 1999 razzie award for worst new star tied with joe esterhas from an alan smithee film burn hollywood burn n

seen december 2 1997 at 6 50 p m at the glenwood movieplex cinemas oneida ny theater 3 by myself for free free pass ntheater rating good seats sound and picture nthere are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons nthey provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation nwatching flubber really clinched this idea for me because its just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy nit proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality and how important it is to actually have a story nthe film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted cartoony atmosphere nwe meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard williams the typical supposedly likable mad scientist nwithin the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is nphillips memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemers disease isnt this rather lowbrow comedy nhe starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class an inappropriate joke for a kids movie if i ever saw one nwe learn he has stood his up fiancee sara harden twice at the altar simply because hes forgotten nsara claims to love him but says if he forgets the wedding again shell stop loving him a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has nbut even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve and its no surprise the major conflicts here are related nchristopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft a scientist who not only wants to steal phillips ideas but his woman too nwhats worse is that sara actually seems interested in him nwilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield which is going broke unless phillip can invent something to save the day none of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film nthe flubber is played for gags after it is introduced but is all but forgotten about thereafter nits obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny nunfortunately the flubber like all the special effects in this film looks very fake and unconvincing nflubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality and by the time it performs a song and dance routine you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object nmost of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy since phillips absentmindedness is forgotten about and somehow push the story along nbut its clear how weak this premise is from the getgo and the film just gets worse nall the jokes involve people getting hit by fastmoving flubberpowered objects including bowling balls flying cars that dont fly well and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air nits all presented with complete logic and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes nduring the basketball scene the coach for the rival team actually says i think they might be cheating to which the referee replies theres no rules about jumping too high n predictable doesnt begin to describe the motions the film goes through especially after the halfway point nand its not how terribly contrived the plot is its the way its broken down scenebyscene with absolutely no transition nnot only that but all the actors here especially williams seem bored to tears nid say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen so its almost forgivable when you realize theyre talking to nothing and interacting with nothing nits safe to say everything that could be bad about flubber is nthe only original element the film has is the worlds first romance between a machine and a human nbut this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it and like the rest of the film you wont n
the main problem with martin lawrences pet project a thin line between love and hate like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man is that his character is an irresponsible jerk and if that is the case it doesnt seem to do anything except justify the womans actions nthat is especially the case in lawrences darnell wright nhe is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long nnow dont think i condone this just because im male nmy philosophy is if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful kind girl you should treat her like a princess and respect her ndarnell doesnt think like this nhe sleeps with these girls once and dumps them nand by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target beautiful wealthy brandi web played nicely by whitfield who runs a successful real estate business is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia king i found myself thinking im supposed to feel sorry for this guy nafter all it is largely darnells fault nif he is lining up all these women youd think hed have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day as his mother says it does nbut he doesnt so you get the sense that hes not only irresponsible but also pretty dumb nyou especially get this sense that hes dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her n id put my pants on in two seconds after that nnow brandi is a psycho bitch but its hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage none final flaw though is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with nbrandi is a classy intelligent woman with an mba from harvard who initally resists darnells immature play as she calls it as any woman like her would in real life nbut all of a sudden she says yes nbut when you listen to darnells four letter word vocabulary watch his actions you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him nlawrence can be good when he wants to but in order to prove it he needs to let other people write and direct his movies nlook at this movie nfour writers as a result its too long two hours when it couldve easily worked at ninety minutes and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came which makes me think the writers didnt get along all of which isnt necessary nthere are some bright spots though nwhitfield regina king della reese and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts and they help it out a lot nand there are some funny parts like for example the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property but theyre just not enough to sustain the film n

attention moviegoers you are about to enter a meaningfree zone nshould the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes do not panic nthe film will work just as well as a silent movie nchronicling the meaningless lives of vain yuppie types the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films last days of disco barcelona and metropolitan but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing nfirsttime writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth nthere isnt one of these characters worth caring about nthe movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of people magazine namong others the movie features ben affleck casey affleck david chappelle janeane garofalo gaby hoffmann catherine kellner courtney love jay mohr martha plimpton christina ricci and paul rudd nand unlike people magazine the people speak not that they have anything interesting to say nits new years eve in 1981 and monica martha plimpton is preparing her big party nstructured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars nmonicas apartment is in noho an area that one of the guests describes as so cool all of the poor people live there ntypical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin paul rudd and his friend and wouldbe sexual partner lucy courtney love nthey argue about whether lucy is a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone except him of course nshe dares him to go immediately to a bathroom stall and have sex with her which turns out to be neither erotic funny or successful rather like the rest of the story nthe movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new years eve birthday n cigarettes are a shield against emotional interaction with other people kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie nanother character played by jay mohr has a problem with his sexual triumphs nevery woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by the next morning nwhen his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him his response is i like a lot of people nas the movie finally draws to a close the characters awaken from their postparty game of musical beds nsome have passed out early from alcohol abuse and remember little while others actually have some clue as to what happened nthe movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind which is probably the best thing that can be said about the movie n200 cigarettes runs 1 40 nit is rated r for profanity sex and one dope smoking scene and would be acceptable for older teenagers n

terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones world war ii novel nunfortunately he buried it within an overlong and overreaching 3hour long pseudoepic nthis is a shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte nthe best scene is when nick noltes character lt col tall is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt staros elias koteas to execute an order nnoltes reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career nhad terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn woody harrelson and john cusack he could have made a truly great film ninstead malick saddled the film with plodding pacing unnecessary flashbacks and a voiceover narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story nthe narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry nwith a lot of editing the core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film nhopefully the dvd version of this film will feature options to suppress the narration and perhaps will even provide for an alternate shorter version of the film ni give this film n
so i went and saw this film right it was called battlefield earth i was never interested in the previews and never too terribly interested in the book nor do i find scientology interesting but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is i had that weird urge just to watch it nwell let me be the first to say and so far in my view its safe to say battlefield earth might be the worst film i have ever seen yes even worse than mr magoo blue in the face or jaws the revenge nroger christianson whos credits include set direction and art direction for such great films as alien and star wars directs this film with such amateurism that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb that its quite depressing nthe look of the film is dark and drabby at times but then bright and happy at other times nthe sound is terrible and has the worst surround sound effects ive heard nthe acting is nothing the dialogue poor and the makeup effects hideous nheres the socalled plot earth 3000 man is a endangered species while aliens from the planet psychlo the aliens are named psychlo i nwonder why are invading earth destined to put an end to those mananimals to an end and destroy earth once and for all of course we have our typical hero played terrible by barry pepper who was great in a small role in 1999s the green mile who is destined to go out and save his planet none thing he has to go up against terl the chief of security psychlo who is played frankly quite bad by john travolta whom with dreadlocks a big head and green eyes just doesnt work nof course the sidekick to terl is played by lol nforest whitaker who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind nour friendly human johnny barry pepper looks just as bad as well with long scraggly hair nim not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film except just to say its terrible neverything in this film is imcomprehinsable from the makeup effects which by the way arent good to the phony looking special effects everything in this film is faulted nin fact i dont remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time or enjoying myself nin fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed nthroughout the entire 127 minute running time i was dying constantly looking at my watch and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something sadly it didnt nmy advice to hollywood get new scripts new acting classes better directors and damnit make films like american beauty more n
lets get this one over with as quickly as possible nif there was a possibility to receive a refund this review would not be forthcoming nbut as it is godzilla is without a doubt the loudest longest and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio nproducer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch last year at merienbad until they can grasp the idea of content and plot nno amount of hype no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine billy the kid vs ndracula n godzilla opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs nwe are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins nwell the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature nlater a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache jean reno interview the sole survivor nin a state of shock the only thing the man can utter is the word gojira the japanese name of the famed beast nwe are then introduced to dr nick tatopoulos matthew broderick with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film nhe is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population nhe is immediately drafted by the u s military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature nin a short amount of time another fishing boat loaded with canned tuna from the u s and korea for some reason is found grounded in jamaica nwell it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york nwhen the beast finally appears he tears up one building stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert thumbs up for new york nthe military with dr tatopouloss help have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system nit finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr tatopoulos who snaps the beasts picture nthe monster eats the fish the military starts shooting and the chase is on with the army causing 90 of the ensuing damage nworking from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple dr totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open even though new york has been evacuated nwell the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant nneedless to say no one believes the good doctor about his discovery so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monsters nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city even though the monster isnt dead yet ni sincerely hope that ive completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film ni gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous or foolish enough to drop down an hours wage on this tripe neverything about godzilla reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast nthe script and lets be clear here by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years razzie award nthe dialogue between maria pitillo as audrey timmonds dr tatopoulos estranged girlfriend and mr broderick is so adolescent it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief as happened during the screening i witnessed nthe film could be enjoyably campy if it didnt take itself so damn seriously nbut to what end as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind nno godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it nthe film is bleak and ugly looking ntaking place at night during a rain storm the movie has little or no depth neverything is ugly and dark nnew york has never looked so inhospitable since death wish nin an attempt to give the film some color audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue nthe only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica where dr tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint nthe scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up nyou know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint nfor a scientist this is very poor observation nlets look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film this activity is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game n1 why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs and how do those eggs fuse into one beast n2 why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate such as new york to nest ni dont think iguanas have a habit of migrating n3 how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system slice a submarine in half yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin in comparison steel cable on the brooklyn bridge n4 the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need its suspension cables n5 did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly nif so then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures n note each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide ngodzilla would have to be over 1 000 feet tall to carry them all n6 godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters but new york cabs are made of stronger steel n7 godzilla can out maneuver helicopters bullets torpedoes and missiles but cant catch you on foot n8 taxis can out maneuver godzilla n9 godzilla can burrow through the subway system but cant tear through the park avenue tunnel n10 why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla nmaybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel n11 galapagos iguanas actually live in the french polynesian islands n12 why was dr tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway n13 how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey n14 new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting nnew yorkers hate beta cam ni could go on and on but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is ndont be fooled this film has less gray matter than any episode of americas funniest home videos nthe performances in the film are singularly bland nnot one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror nthe characters in the midst of the onslaught have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee failed relationships career choices nthe only common occurrence that doesnt take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement but then that would have made them believable ngodzilla for the most part is okay nthe design of the beast is funky if not very memorable none thing that comes to mind the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark namely his atomic breath nnow i for one cant quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait na good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly nthere is so much wrong with this film that i cant really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted except for my divorce nany film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac nthe addition of the baby raptors ah i meant godzillas are nothing but a direct rip off of jurassic park but with none of that films suspense or tension nsuffice to say that godzilla is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade nthis is a film that needed the hype nwith the current level of writing and directing nothing else about the film succeeds nif youve seen the trailers youve seen the best parts nmy only suggestion for mr d and mr e is that they could always go back to selling shoes n this film could be the next rocky horror nonly its not funny n
are you like me ndo you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places shouting out loud not giving a ratts ass about anyone around them and basically just wallowing in their own selfimportance nwell if you are than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half only to make up and hug in the end naaaaaaaahhhh nplot three grownup sisters living their own separate lives begin to reestablish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill ncritique this would be a good movie if it wasnt for the fact that its got very little to say features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any thirdrate afterschool special nand im being nice nhow junk like this gets made is beyond me but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit nthe only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryans character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot nwow how ndeep nof course the same christmas tune thats played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background while characters continue to build bonds among one another by making reference to old quaint movies or movie stars nstop me im ngonna cry again nthis film is a mess nthe characters are boring and irritating to watch the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot kind of liking their father but not really and then finally realizing the error of their ways while sharing an emotional moment about movie stars from the 50s nadmittedly i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film nmeg did fine as the sister who cries a lot looking as adorable as ever but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movietv show that shes in nenough already nand diane keaton mustve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one cause her acting was amateurish at best nneither one convinced in emotional scenes ngranted they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and thats probably where my rating of three points comes from nall in all this movie is not funny unless youre one to chuckle at train wrecks provides zero drama unless you consider loud phone conversations moving generates absolutely no emotion although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine and ends on a perfectly pretentious note oh no please dont get any flour on my donna karan dress nugh ni suggest that all ladies take their husbandsboyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something nthatll teach em to mess with you noh and incidentally mrs joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind so there nthen again maybe nyoull like it n n
the premise of this movie is well pretty farfetched ntom berenger plays shale a mercenary who is temporarily out of work those fools at the cia have denied his existence just because he and his buddies botched a job in cuba nfortunately his girl friend diane venora a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher nnot telling his girl friend who might object on pedagogical grounds he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself from yale harvard princeton et al and begins his tenure as a high school teacher nthe students junkies drug dealers gang members sleazy sluts icepick wielders you nget the picture dont really take to him right away so he hits one in the face with a can and breaks a few fingers nthis gets their attention to a certain extent so he tells them the story of the vietnam war see some homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from the south noh yeah now they can dig it the problem is just that nobody ever explained it properly before nbut wait nthere are drugs being dealt in the school itself nand behind the whole scheme in cahoots with the head gang the kod no not cod but knights of destruction really is none other than the nupright excop principal played by the forgotten ghostbuster ernie hudson nso shale does what any good teacher would do nhe gets his buddies together they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons explosives and cool stuff like that and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school nok so the premise is not just farfetched its downright dumb nif this were a hong kong action comedy we might just accept it but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun noh it has its moments how one can truly hate a movie in which huge really huge amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses nand to be fair it is almost never really boring as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story nbut over all this is pretty much a madefortv movie with more and bigger explosions and more foul language nin fact it reminded me of miami vice without the production values babes in skimpy bikinis and pastels nif you can sneak into the theater without paying go for it notherwise wait for video nthe flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast n a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha n pretty good bring a friend n amazing potent stuff n perfection nsee it twice n
 virus is the type of cliched vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it nstrangely enough on the same midjanuary weekend last year another film was released like this deep rising about an ugly monster on a cruise liner nprior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989s leviathan 1989s deep star six and all four alien pictures n virus in comparison is a servicable thriller wellmade and produced but since it doesnt include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on nbased on a series of comic books virus concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon nafter discovering that the boat is slowly sinking un lucky for them a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen nonce the team reaches the russian ship they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted nafter turning the power back on however there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself none survivor finally does turn up nadia joanna pacula who informs the suicidal and stern captain donald sutherland and one of the crew kit foster jamie lee curtis that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out nif virus sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies youre correct nalthough the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life the film itself doesnt appear to have a brain in its head nthe film sticks so close to the wornout conventions of the creature genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film nthe actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play nin her second return to horror in the last year jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine but that is about it nalthough 1998s halloween h20 was also a disappointment at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character unlike here ndonald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films such as 1994s the puppet masters although i just watched him in the superb 1978 scifi classic invasion of the body snatchers where he was fabulous nthe last of the three topbillers is william baldwin but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture since he has nothing to do nbasically virus is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space shipocean linerhaunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them onebyone nit is not the worst of its type but it is far from one of the best and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this nas long as some of them keep making money i suspect the answer is never n
words i thought id never write the sequel to urban legend lacks the grace wit and power of the original nput the gun to my head pull the trigger and put me out of my misery nbetter yet put the horror genre out of its misery nwhen youve finished watching urban legends final cut youll share my same grim point of view thanks to the horrible acting terrible script and ridiculous directing which has become all too common today nurban legends final cut is a smorgasbord of stolen movie ideas mainly from the blair witch project and scream fabulous people with perfect teeth and skin one creepy film school and a dog eating a freshly removed kidney from one of the movies hapless victims nurban legends delivers a story about a bunch of film students working on their thesis films to win the coveted hitchcock award which guarantees the winner a director deal in hollywood none female filmmaker jennifer morrison the freaky dead girl from stir of echoes writes a fiction script based on a serial killer who kills his victims according to urban legend tales nsuddenly her entire crew starts getting bumped off with urbanlegendary homicides but the bodies are always missing and she is often the only witness to the killings nthe killer wears a fencing mask and a long black overcoat looking like a scorned olympian out to avenge his defeat in sydney nwhy this is scary is never explained nof course the golden rule of sequels is that there must be least one recurring character for continuitys sake nurban legends has one minor recurring character from the original who we never cared about anyway the security guard of all people nthe other central problem is that this character has already seen the urban legend killings once before but shes utterly clueless about whats going on around her ncall it suspension of disbelief nthis film is also a prime example of how horror films are now completely dead in the water nthe last decent horror film was the blair witch project and that seemed more like a snuff film than fiction nthe stalking killer with crazy motivation has become a tired clich as everyone seems to have forgotten real horror is not about what is seen but about what is unknown n
has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plotdriven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs nin enemy of the state that is exactly right na few parts the net and a few parts conspiracy theory enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997s lame brained men in black nwill this guy ever get a real role nhe has the bruce willis syndrome nthe plot is bascially smith playing a lawyer getting into hot water with some high government murderers who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie when a tape of the killing gets into his hands nhe inlists the help of an old conspirator hackman and at the end er you nknow nenemy was one of the worst films of last year nnot only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven and i didnt like how smith always magically outsmarted the badies when all the other extra characters seeming more intelligent than smith somehow got run over by a truck nenemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek insurrection ni know these two films are different in well everything but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me nsomehow quality cant overshadow quantity n
well what are you going to expect nits a movie about a big snake that eats people nthats what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more ninstead i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me too nanaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river nled by anthropologists dr steven cale eric stolz and terri flores jennifer lopez the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives nalong the way they find poacher paul sarone jon voight and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda nto simply say that this is the worlds largest snake wouldnt be doing it justice since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide nif this isnt a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers i dont know what is nat the beginning of anaconda we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past but that seems to be more or less over now ni expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line but it ended up being a setup for nothing ncale chokes on a deadly wasp dont ask me how that happens i dont know and is put out of action relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help nthis minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarones plan to capture the snake nhowever this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle nmost bad characters are either annoying or stupid nin this movie theyre both nsince this description applies to all the characters except sarone its hard to find someone to root for nyoure supposed to back the good guys but you really end up cheering for sarone because hes smarter than everyone else nor maybe hes just not as dumb as everyone else nat times i almost found myself rooting for the snake nthere are no standout performances here neveryone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters neven voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason nno matter as in most monster movies the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway nin most of the scenes the snake is computer generated and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real nhowever the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences nsometimes for example the snake just moves too fast nit catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall for crying out loud nthen theres another scene where the snake eats one of the characters and we see the snakes skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victims pained expression from within the snakes belly nabsolutely ridiculous na testimony to the films bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is nin a scene totally unrelated to anything else we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther nthe anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard one of the panthers eyeballs pops out neeeewwwww nabove and beyond the sick factor however this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed nin films like these a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained nif the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them nto show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters dont know about and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown nin a case like that the showdown just ends up being a letdown nwhen i saw the snake for the first time i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasnt the real danger nthis one was just a decoy and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe nno such luck nokay maybe anaconda is actually a decoy and theres really a better movie waiting to make its debut n
this is the worst movie ive viewed so far in 98 nthe avengers silly man dressed in a bowler hat woman wearing tight leathers evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits greater evil sir august de wynter wearing kilt nthe question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast nthe same question was probably asked of last years stinker batman and robin ni feel the production got a little too smug the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie nmy greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed thurman and fiennes something that was a vital element of the 60s tv serial of the same name nthe dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks but does not allow much room for character development and interaction except to perhaps grate on the viewers nerves none wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality nconnery as sir august does not fair better than thurman or fiennes nhis dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather mostly embarrassing and poor quality nif there is a movie you would prefer never to see i believe the avengers would be a good choice nfor one thing you will not have to witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title ni cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature like lightning you cant see it coming until it hits you n
woody allen is one of the most successful artistdirectors in hollywood but he is becoming less and less reliable as a filmmaker nin his early years of filmmaking he mastered the simple comedy nfrom there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles nsome of these work better than others nzelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist ndeconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back nharry block allen has in his life only two drives nhe wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing nthe story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments nperhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harrys life by editing harrys scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out nas a writer harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises nthe film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harrys books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harrys life nthese fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters nit is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person nif that sounds complicated it is nthen as another device in one of the stories an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image nharry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time nas if these touches did not create sufficient confusion the story is told out of chronological order nif allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable nbut allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand ndeconstructing harry is set at a time when harrys old college the one that expelled him when he attended it wants now to honor him for a lifetime of writing achievement nharry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him njust why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear nharry tries his current girl friend fay elizabeth shue only to find that she is about to marry harrys old friend larry billy crystal nblock would like his son hilly eric lloyd to accompany him but hillys mother previously first harrys psychiatrist and more recently his wife refuses to let her son see his father nanother friend richard bob balaban would go but has health problems nharry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie hazel goodman nit is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite but cookie is considerably differentblack and a lot brighter than mira sorvinos character in the previous film nwhile the comedy sequences are never complete a few are elaborate and some quite funny nthe centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil who looks a lot like larry nthat story also is left uncompleted perhaps to show harrys unwillingness to commit even to telling a story nthe linchpin that was needed to tie together the stylistic quirks of this film was a central character who changes and who gives us something about which to care nthat character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes nallen can do much better than deconstructing harry ni rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale n

the skulls is a laughably bad thriller a teenorientated doppelganger of the firm so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor ncertain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter ni chuckled incessantly all the way home nlet me share nthe skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale designed im sure to mirror the actual skull bones from the same college nluke mcnamara joshua jackson a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year highlights the latest skull scouting report ndespite some anxiety and caution from others luke accepts entry into the organization nsoon after he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women driving a new car and marveling at the 20 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account nyeah dude pretty good deal eh nbut luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating when circumstances become extreme there is no way he can leave the society except maybe as a drooling vegetable nthe premise although lacking in originality certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense nunfortunately the skulls is neither intriguing nor suspenseful nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting nits just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack the stars nbut not the script nthe skulls is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value with the screenplay by jon pogue immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers nfirst off upon their initiation into the skulls each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm nafterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar nwill they never take this watch off nand what if they forget it by their bedside nperhaps their secret society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed non top of this they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters ngee why not member tshirts nbut my favorite bit is this the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual agree or disagree notions when making collective decisions nthey are given official skull paddles nwhen flipped to one side they indicate the member agrees with the proposal nfacing the opposite way means a disagreement nwouldnt they merely express themselves verbally nhell no nthey have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote and maybe afterward they can play pingpong nim still chuckling about these ludicrous details but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest nthe cast meanwhile combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the dawsons creek crowd and fuses the two together ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout nbut not entirely naccomplished actors like craig t nelson as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake and william peterson as fellow board member senator levritt are dealt pathetic villain caricatures and look suitably embarrassed handling them nand then theres christopher mcdonald who has the capacity to be a fun exciting actor nmcdonalds charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role yes pogue makes it a hattrick ni pray it was a snatchthepaycheckandrun exercise for all these actors nthe young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better nlets cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character npaul walker the strapping quarterback from varsity blues is bland but passable as caleb mandrake the judges son nwalker preserves a straight face even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie dad i just killed a guy in the ritual room nsome actual spark is generated by leslie bibb who plays lukes longtime chum chloe and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics nit really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one nor maybe not minute one thanks to a decent setup from director rob cohen who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style nit makes you wonder why he didnt flee indefinitely from the project because while enjoyable cheese like dragonheart and the moderate stallone thriller daylight arent superior cinema they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash naside from unintentionally humoring the audience the skulls gets little accomplished nthe thrills and action are lazy and mechanical nthe story is stuffed with ridiculous formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick ninstead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage nweve seen it all before and better nthe skulls is a feeble little circus of stupidity so miscalculated that while it would serve as a clever pun a term like boneheaded seems just too generous n

it seemed like the perfect concept nwhat better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality nits exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh njim carreys signed on too neven better nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just couldnt take a joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy nyes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isnt funny nits not for lack of trying nthe farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most highconcept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them nthis of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely tooforgiving nature making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult nsoon enough charlies repressed aggression manifests itself into a second independent personality named hank a deepvoiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster nthis guy isnt above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which hes been insulted or holding a little girls head underwater because she refused to stop jumproping in the street nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks nsome have suggested that this isnt a problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesnt require plot to work ntheyre wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort 1996s theres something about mary n 1999s outside providence was technically an earlier project nthe brothers earlier film wasnt funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected nin mary the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleightofhand trick theyd have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion n me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work nhaving been produced by the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes nbut they havent come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote bythenumbers adolescent comedy nthe plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p waters renee zellweger whos in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending thats entirely predictable from the getgo n think charlie and irene will fall in love nyeah me too nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you havent already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely softtossed presenting an obvious problem when grossout humor loses its shock value its no longer funny merely gross nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry ntake for example the subplot involving charlies three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and whitebread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely toopleasant smile on his face nbut by the end of the film theyre still doing the same schitck it hasnt been elevated to another funnier level and it hasnt been dropped either nthats too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through n me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlies new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hanks actions nthis doesnt really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlies condition early on so they dont have any opportunity to be surprised by it nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesnt go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax njim carrey is a gifted comedian both physically and vocally but hes left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in all of me nits a great showcase of flexibility and splitsecond roleshifting but none of it is terribly funny ncarrey doesnt pull any stunts we dont expect him to pull and the farrellys script doesnt give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the roleshifting arent set up in any meaningful way nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better nzellwegers irene is not a strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strongwilled nirene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether shes ditzy clever or neither nas such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straightlaced for a movie like this nhe like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected nafter viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked nbut i dont believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style nif the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and i still think they are theyll rebound just fine neven after that happens though ill still consider me myself irene to be a highcaliber misfire n
wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions nover black and white drawings we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiationinduced mutation nthe original inhabitants of the earth fairies and elves return to populate the globe along with their evil mutant counterparts none day and i say one day not to be trite but because thats exactly how it happened no advance notice a fairy queen gives birth to twins one good and one evil nthe twins grow up to be powerful wizards the good one embracing magic and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire nwe are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology nas unoriginal as the premise is i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out ntheres a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world after all ni soon learned however that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film nonce the transition was made from still art to color animation an entirely different feel takes precedence nrather than the epic saga promised by the narration we get a goofylooking world of a saturday morning cartoon nnot just the look mind you but all the zany sounds like honk boing nfor years blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined nhowever blackwolf now has a secret weapon nazis nyup adolf hitler the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht nokay not the real things but an archival film his minions dug up nprojected into the sky for all to see it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up nbefore you know it there are dead elves everywhere nthis is just as well nthe characters are so bad that the viewer doesnt care about any of them ntheyre either silly sappy or both nthe dialog gets much of the credit for this nan example is when avatar nonchalantly says well looks like my brother and i begin our final battle nnot very formidable when hes also the guy who says this is the biggest bummer of a trip ive ever been on nmy favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good cant fight back against the nazicharged evil nher response is they have weapons and technology nwe just have love nsuffice to say the characters are strictly twodimensional and we therefore dont expect anything more than the obvious to happen nwhich it does nthe only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out which is anticlimactic and disappointing nplease note that it is the action that is unexpected nthat it is disappointing is not nthe film couldnt settle on a particular mood nit seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle nscenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity nthe dramatics which seem to occur at random are overly staged and overly acted detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned nralph bakshi the director makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film hitler and the nazis were bad nso who doesnt know this already nwell maybe children nokay so you might say that this is a movie for children nits not nin the scenes where good fights evil theres a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if theyre watching a cartoon nso is the film for adults nif so we probably dont need to be bashed over the head to get the point nwhy not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know nwizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes and hitler giving speeches nhowever we dont see any reason why they should be considered bad nwe see no atrocities being committed not even any real battle footage nthere is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich and were not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place nthis needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment nid like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere at any time and we must therefore be vigilant nhowever im not sure if i want to give him that much credit n
although i had not been a viewer of the rugrats television series i went into their first animated feature film the rugrats movie with a positive attitude nthe trailer looked cute enough after all nafter seeing it i think the words in my recent antz review in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995s the pebble and the penguin were a bit premature n the rugrats movie is bottomofthebarrel childrens fare at its worst and starts to make antz look good in comparison nas in the show the rugrats movie is about a group of very little friends ranging from babies to a threeyearold nthe head of the group tommy pickles e g ndaily becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill get it ndill pickles hardeeharhar and is informed by his threeyearold cousin anjelica cheryl chase that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children nwhen the other children chuckie and twins lil and phil suggest taking dill back to the hospital tommy goes along with it but on their way there they crash in the forest and become lost running into wolves and circus monkeys among other things n the rugrats movie judging from the idea of being lost in the woods could have been a potentially fun family film and there were many different things that could have been done with the story nso what did the writers choose to do nwhy they set up a protracted cliched scene where the children almost go over a waterfall of course nfor the youngest of children ages 37 the rugrats movie may very well entertain them judging from the audience i saw this with nof course if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents they were all desperately struggling to stay awake and that included me nfor an adult the rugrats movie is a piece of garbage nthe plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm nthere isnt one laugh to be had in the film nor is there any excitement nif anything is even marginally good in the picture it is the bright animation style so it is especially unfortunate that it wasnt to service a more quality film n the rugrats movie is doa from the start ni am all for a worthwhile family movie but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful nas said before young children may like it but even they deserve better than this nfor adults it is a nearly unbearable excruciating chore to sit through nas for me the rugrats movie is not the worst of the year nor is it the most deeply hated but it is the most boring nparents do yourselves a favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of the wizard of oz nthat is a picture that contains a great deal of magic and wonder two things of which the rugrats movie is completely missing n
depending on who you ask the original sin was either the eating of the apple the act of disobedience against god or the act of betrayal nbut in case you didnt know this dont bother remembering it nthe words original sin never come up in the movie of the same name let alone the concept of it nthe closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba circa 1900 nregardless of its senseless title original sin does actually have a plot albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war based on the book waltz across darkness nboy antionio banderas places personal ad sometime around 1900 searching for a wife nsince this is a century ago we narrowly dodge a remake of green card only to find that the girl jolie faked her photo and is actually beautiful nskipping a few moderately useless sex scenes getting the question out of the way yes we get to see angelina jolies breasts again the girl turns out to be a con artist swindles boy for his money and heads for the hills noriginal sin then briefly tries to be a thriller nwe see boy go whorechasing saying he wants to find girl and kill her nbut as soon as boy actually finds girl instead of following what might have been a promising or at least not completely fucking boring thriller the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virginwhore complex since milk money ngirl toys with the idea of reforming her congirl past all the while avoiding the other man a lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place nadd insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect and acting roughly the caliber of a b b gun and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year ndont even bother with original sin but if you do go be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal njust keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block its much worse than a sin nthis is sacrilege n
wesley snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles nmurder at 1600 u s marshals money train drop zone boiling point and the ultimate camp film passenger 57 nthe art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category nultimately it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe and terrible acting by blist actors like michael biehn and anne archer noddly it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes masterpiece rising sun nthe movie revolves around the convenient story of a special un operative caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador the chinese triad brotherhood a rich chinese businessman played by that bad guy from rising sun caryhiroyuki tagawa a chinese un interpreter and inexplicably donald sutherland nthe film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island nor should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woos hong kong films combined ni am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film ni usually enjoy snipes movies though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films nsimply i am amazed by the how inane the script was filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences ndirector christian duguay screamers has a strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts showing splattering brains people impaled with broken shards of glass and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere nit also sickens me to know that oliver stone one of the greatest directors working today had his hand in producing this monstrosity ni guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle and stone chose not to read the script watch the dailies be involved in casting or anything else or else hed be filing a court order to remove his name from the credits nits also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies and the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese nim sure over the next couple of months even more chinese conspiracymartialarts action flicks are going to be popping up in your local multiplex nhopefully they wont include wesley snipes n
 the beach is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder nevery forty minutes of this twohour film begins with a new theme virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act nit starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment nbut then in the second act the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of blue lagoon nforty minutes later the mood changes once more and it becomes a dumbed down version of lord of the flies where an isolated community is discovered where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs nby the time its over you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about nthe main character of the beach is angstridden richard leonardo dicaprio nhe travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if youre looking for a good time nrichards voiceover tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown nthis seedy environment is just what richard is looking for nhe checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy robert carlisle nhe seems like a raving lunatic obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis nthough his jagged behavior would distress most of us richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen nmoreover the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life ncaptivated by the idea he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey nthey are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richards nonce they finally arrive at this paradise however the mood of the story shifts to richards growing desire for francoise nthis particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard netienne is about as exciting as fluffy white sand nits odd that etienne never sees this coming but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view nand once the three stumble across the hidden community mood shift imminent more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers nfor example there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards nand the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark nthere are several ideas that are introduced in the beach and each one could merit its own featurelength film ntheres the man vs nature angle the love triangle angle and the utopiagoneawry angle nbut the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred ndicaprio as a result has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through nconsequently the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up n
when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions i turned to my friend and said dangerous liaisons for kids nit was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense owing everything it is to stephen frears 1988 masterpiece nimagine my surprise to see that writerdirector roger kumble has given credit to his source material choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits nand i was impressed nin fact i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film which is an appalling excuse for a movie nits kiddieporn hackwork complete with earthy sextalk and fullyclothed handjobs ni suppose this kind of movie was inevitable with all the teen highschool angst movies coming out there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think theyre smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined ncruel intentions is a mess in every possible way and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to i hated all the characters and i hate everything they do ni also hate ryan phillippe so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be nphillippe plays check out this name sebastian valmont nwow nisnt that a memorable name ni could just say it over and over again nsebastian valmont nit kind of rolls off the tongue in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich nsebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth there is no woman he cant have no material object out of his reach nhe has all the money all the sex all at his fingertips nand luckily his parents never enter into his life no in the world of cruel intentions adults dont really exist nthe ones who do are irritating nsebastian valmont lives with his stepsister kathryn merteuil sarah michelle gellar the bitchqueen of the universe and also the woman every man wants nsince these two rich kids are so bored they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons nkathryn wants sebastian valmont to devirginize cecile caldwell selma blair a naive dorkchick who has somehow wronged kathryn nbut its too easy for sebastian valmont he wants to nail annette hargrove reese witherspoon the paradigm of chastity and beauty nso sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal which is too explicit to state here nbut dear god n sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove ndangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable and because of its masterful acting ncruel intentions is bad for many reasons but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting nkathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her nshe is supposed to be mean but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons ngellar while aesthetically pleasing is onedimensional and utterly repulsive nwitherspoon has a truly beautiful face but her character isnt the moral staple shes supposed to be sure she wont have sex until shes in love is this really a moral issue but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible nbut i cant forget mr phillippe who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable invulnerable blandness ni have to give him credit and say that he did in fact manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions nand theres one point in the film in which he shouts thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone ntrue he is bad but it doesnt help that he has no character to work with nkumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character leaving us with a sexcrazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch nthe film fails in every other way too nfirst of all nobody talks like this neven the intellectuals i know dont bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering nfor a while the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs but it ends up taking itself so seriously that theres no way we can join it ncruel intentions also manages to come off as softporn in more than one scene nearlier i mentioned a fullyclothed handjob this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie nso if we hate them then whats the point of an extended sex scene ntitillation of course nit cant even work under the pretense of meaningful love scene because we hate the characters nits interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons nkumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film many of the scenes have a similar tone and there are moments in frears film that kumble imitates almost completely such as the last scene in which spoiler warning the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers nbut kids dont act like this nnobody acts like this nin his translation roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy some pretty crucial elements nthe result is a picture of confounding badness a kiddieporn mess that thinks its really deep and profound nill give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences but that doesnt change the fact that its awful n
 it was not scary nthese are the first words that came to mind after it was over nwhen a movie is called vampires not scary arent words that should be associated with it nbut that wasnt my only gripe njohn carpenter is a name associated with cuttingedge cinema as in the intense scares of halloween the thing and the prince of darkness or the offbeat action of they live and escape from new york nunfortunately the only thing that is cutting edge about vampires is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach nwith an anemic plot and notquitekosher special effects john carpenters vampires has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan nthe film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers led by james woods of all people nlike some sort of holy ateam they even have their own soupedup van the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack ntheir method is amusingly innovative the bloodsuckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks nto commemorate their victory the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away ntheir celebration is shortlived however as a master vampire named valek ambushes and singlehandedly destroys most of the team nwoods jack crow and buddy montoya daniel baldwin escape with their lives along with a woman named katrina sheryl lee nalthough the woman has been bitten montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire nthe rest of the movie is concerned with the boys hunt for valek thomas ian griffith a freaky marilyn mansontype whos on a mission that dates back 600 years nalong the way they pick up a priest named guiteau tim guinee a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl nupham in saving private ryan nsome stuff happens in the middle of the movie but i cant remember most of it because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen nvampires finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix as crow guiteau and montoya assault an abandoned prisonturned vampire nest nonly then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick nbut its too little too late nwe get the inevitable final confrontation but it seems tacked on and rather anticlimactic come on were dealing with the master vampire here ninterestingly last summers vampire actioner blade was derived from a comic book and vampires from a novel yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former a more deliberate superhero flick nwoods jack crow spouts glib offthecuff oneliners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that ohsocool stride nand his motive for killing vampires ntake a wild guess n hint a killed his when he was just a nat least blade had decent action and slick stylishness nvampires lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamerthin plot nto make up for this the movie resorts to other shocks such as its generally condescending attitude towards women crow slaps them around for the fun of it and an overplayed contempt for religion crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to getting woodies nit can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie nif not scary and gory i wanted tense relentless and exhausting njohn carpenters vampires is none of these ni can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan nfor the rest of you looking for a good scare beware vampires is a film with no teeth n

im not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick because im not sure just what the hell pardon the expression was going on in it nhowever i can express the most important observation i made of it i e ni didnt like it nif i had to summarize this film i think id conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal nthats the kernel of it anyway ntossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women feminism the role of the devil modern reformers and friendship nunfortunately little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts theyre simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace nactually i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was nthey came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy on the level of ghostbusters and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones nthey laughed or tried to laugh at moments that were either barely funny or much more horrible than funny as if that could bend the film away from its rather frightening direction nthree women cher susan sarandon and michelle pfieffer live in eastwick a small midwestern town none night while drinking late into the evening they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives nin seeming answer to their idle daydreams a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be nhe soon shows evidence of mysticalperhaps demonicpower and his devotion to the womens merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones neven worse when ignored his moods become ugly and he mistreats the women for spurning him nanyway the problems all three female characters are fairly uninteresting and several are cardboard stereotypes especially sarandons character nwe never get inside them never feel sympathetic to them because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland nas for nicholson well even the devil needs a direction to go in and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie due to the grace of the screenwriter and more importantly nicholsons acting he still cant be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague nand then theres the special effects nnot in themselvesthey werent that goodbut their overuse ni was almost positive until i saw the credits that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl because of the big name actors in dopy stunts or stephen spielberg after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholsonblowndownthestreet stunt nnope its another bunch of guys and directed by george miller who has shown great skill with stuntsspecial effects before the road warrior nightmare at 20 00 feet episode of twilight zone the movie but apparently doesnt know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act nfgawds sake guys this is jack nicholson nlet him loose nlet him grin demonically nskip the splitting earth and fake lightning nwatching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll all i could think of was what a waste nif youre going to use slapstick like that use it up on pee wee herman nnicholson does what he can with the role and when he can find his bearings can be extremely good the scene in the church for instance but most of the time he seems a bit stiff as if hes not sure what he should be doing next nand no wonder nthis script goes all over the map giving you the feeling that itd just love to be allegory but its not sure about what maybe if you give it time itll think of something nso what is the witches of eastwick na horror movie na folk tale na comedy na statement about women nan examination of the religious right or comparitive morality ni tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me watching nsomeone regurgitate halfdigested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms people the screen and ultimately the audience nin other words a mess n 2 00 nif you like nicholson enough to watch him here maybe 25 of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others n

window across the street nwe get the requisite electrogreen throughthesight view nwe the audience seeing a high tech riflely gadget of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target but instead he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy lowquality photographs which eye then proceeds to fax and email to everyone in his targets office nall right so thirty seconds in i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless riflecamera but i was still open minded nmaybe theres a really good reason for it nive got reason to believe you see i admire a lot of ewan mcgregors previous work nand hes obi wan ke frigginnobi for gods sake nand director stephan elliots last movie priscilla queen of the desert was a quirky little delight ntheres some genuine talent involved here ni think at the twenty minute mark there was still a spark of hope in my heart neye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organizations son i still have no idea what this organization was british intelligence nnational spy ring nprivate investigation who is apparently stealing from his trust fund nhe has received his assignment from k d nlang through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase nwhen eye tracks his target to an expensive looking secluded house he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ashley judd take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard nok thats odd i think to myself this could be interesting nthen she starts to cry and through her tears exclaims merry christmas dad nfor the first time nso begins our tale of obsession nor something nthe rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregors eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar nthroughout his entire professional life he has been a voyeur so when he falls for someone the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras nfine thats a lovely premise i suppose nbut gosh darn it if youre going to go there you better have some sort of explanation nand thats precisely where this film fails nthis is the kind of movie that pisses me off nits an abortion a collection of halfformed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end nit pretends it is something that it is not a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a hightech thriller nhere the filmmakers have confused surreal and deep with vaguely unclear and crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors ni never even for an instant had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in love with this woman who changes wigs and kills people nthe movie offers only two explanations neither of which make a lick of sense nexplanation number one the obnoxious presence of eyes imaginary daughter who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago tells him he shouldnt leave ms judd nexplanation two which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie beauty is in the eye of the beholder nwhoo hoo that helps thanks a bunch case closed nthats as deep as it gets folks nthere is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes which instead of tying everything together ends up being as profound as a clever sixthgrade mad lib nthere are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was nmy personal favorites include the prisonmatron modeled after austin powers frau farbissina who apparently taught ms judd everything she knows about wearing wigs jason priestleys awfully played dirty desert vagrant 1 who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet but fails miserably and the copwhoseesashleyfleeinganaccidentsceneand thenwantstopayforsex butisshot neach one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last nthe script pays no attention to the laws of time and space nany time one of the frequent location changes occurs the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe and minutes weeks or years could have passed nbewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slowmotion closeup awash in a lot of bass newan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell njason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks then laughs maniacally ncut to random guy with eye patch niguana out of focus niguana comes into focus nwow man nwhen i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel it came as no surprise to me nthere are plenty of elements here that if extended and fleshed out more would have made for a decent story nand i wouldnt be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere or waiting in the wings for the dvd special directors cut nnot that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing nthe last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition nsome guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone and this time i didnt particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking nsomeone near cellphoneguy did eventually yell shut the hell up but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen n

the thirteenth floor is a bland obligatory exercise in genre filmmaking nif i hadnt recently watched the matrix and open your eyes both of which are similar but far superior i might have been a little nicer to this picture ncraig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall the rich cocreator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss armin muellerstahl neverything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one and characters stare at each other for maddeninglylong periods of time and refuse to communicate on any realistic level nthe acting is okay but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of and features a script copenned by director josef rusnak loaded with cliches and stock characters nthere are individual scenes and ideas that work i like the thought of a sentient computer program but none of the films strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree nproducer roland emmerich based on this and his previous directorial efforts seems hellbent on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre sciencefiction n
depending on your degree of cinematic acumen last man standing is either a a prohibitionera remake of akira kurosawas 1961 classic yojimbo b a prohibitionera remake of sergio leones 1964 classic a fistful of dollars c a prohibitionera action drama with a completely original storyline nnew line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category c than in the other two combined much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons nthe fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the real source material the dashiell hammett novel red harvest nit also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself nthis time around the man with no name is played by bruce willis a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico nby all appearances jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border none is headed by an irishman named doyle david patrick kelly the other is run by chicagoconnected italian mobster strozzi ned eisenberg ncalling himself john smith the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyles side nbut smiths allegiance is as uncertain as his name and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them nviewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakescumbastardizations nthere is the happily ineffectual lawman bruce dern the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses affections karina lombard the barkeep who becomes our antiheros only friend william sanderson suspicious lieutenants christopher walken and michael imperioli to question the bosses trust in smith a brutal beating and a big fire ndirector walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity but at least he doesnt try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture nwhat he does do is nearly as big a mistake and that is to provide a running voiceover narration by willis which rings of the standard hardboiled style of pulp detective fiction nyes that narration is full of cliches but those are are not particularly troubling nthe problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters nthey were a mystery to the other characters in the film and to the audience their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status nwith john smiths voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought he becomes more mundane just another tough guy trying to stay alive nit feels like a hammett novel all right and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice but it simply doesnt work nthe narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence and the man with no name takes no one into his confidence neven if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate i cant imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction nwillis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else nchristopher walken plays doyles brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of softspoken psychos and there isnt another single character whom makes even the slightest impression nwith no compelling antagonist for smith there is no buildup towards the expected showdown and when it does come that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about ncinematographer lloyd ahern who also did the only noteworthy work on hills 1995 flop wild bill creates some nifty sunburned vistas but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counterproductive narration nsometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original theyll wonder what all the talk was about nin the case of last man standing it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about n
this wellconceived but ultra sugary comingofage film is not for everyone and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion njoseph cross joshua beal is a 10yearold who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather loggia to bone marrow cancer nloggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup nthe beals are like a sitcom idyllic family where everyone is just so nice and affluent and properly religious without being fanatical nthe beals the father denis leary and his wife dana delany are both successful doctors julia stiles plays joshuas older sister needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him nthis is a family seemingly conceived in heaven but living in south philadelphia sending their children to a wellrun catholic school njoshua the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn is a handsome sweet intelligent friendly and endearing child who does well in school relates to the nuns and priests and talks politely to his wellmeaning parents nall this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch nthe plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather who promised to be with him forever nhis answer is to search for god pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do but thats just the way it is sometimes nthis search for god takes us nowhere because as his friend david reifsnyder says where can you look for him if he doesnt exist nnow thats a smart kid nbut joseph looks for him in the usual places and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends none of his teachers is the kindhearted sister terry rosie odonnell who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball making him the cleanup hitter and in my opinion if she wasnt a big tv star would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher she is that convincing nthroughout the film she is saved from answering any tough sic nquestion about god by the bell as it rings to end the class nnothing much happens in the search for god there is no parody of the catholic school though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god but this is gentle stuff no real criticism or search for god is attempted nwhat comes next into play is some hollywood hokum which is designed not to upset anyone as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real live angel a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goodygoody nthe film ends as this angel ntells him his grandfather is all right nhis quest is ended as apparently angels dont have wings and are approachable and god well nmaybe thats for another film down the road nthis part of the film was the final straw for me i couldnt swallow any more goo nas this film flopped commercially his next one the sixth sense pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose nthough if you look through the cleverness of both scripts this director is loaded with hokum all he has learned how to do is hide the hokum better nwell god bless him if he can do that nthis is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood nits just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death children in a parochial elementary school or for that matter about god nand that family of his theyre too good for words nyet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place nfor those who want to see something soft without a bite to it this is the one n
when youve run out of old tv shows to turn into movies i guess you try video games nwhy did i go to see mortal kombat annihilation nthe quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw nthis film was a bunch of fighting yelling special effects and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack nthe plot is fairly simple a portal has opened between our world and the outworld allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn brian thompson to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity nthe good guys led by sorcerer rayden james remar and human mortal liu kang robin shou must take the fight to outworld where the fate of both worlds will be determined nheres the catch they must reunite princess katana talia soto whos on the good side with her resurrected mother queen sindel musetta vander whos on the bad side for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanitys safety for another generation nhow this is supposed to work i still have no idea but i liked katanas line i knew love would keep us together since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh nthere are some seriously stupid things in this movie ntake for example a transportation system which utilizes the inner winds generated by earths magma flows nyou get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast nhow fast nas katana says you will be moving so fast it will be as if you are not moving at all nwhat nlater sonya blade sandra hess goes to find jax lynn red williams otherwise known as saber on tvs american gladiators at a medical research facility on the island of oahu nhow do we know this is where she went ntheres a sign on the facilitys perimeter fence that reads medical research facility oahu hawaii nremember this is not a caption but an actual sign ni guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are ntheres a lot of major flipping action too nthe first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another ndo they land and immediately get into the fighting ndoes one of them land first and catch the other off guard ndo they collide in midair nno apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away nwhy did they need those metal balls to travel neveryone could have just flipped from point a to point b ni have to admit the fight scenes are pretty good although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics nthe movies thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly n ouch was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one nyou could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights not plot would be the main draw since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next nit seems thats all there is in this movie nmaybe it is nas i had mentioned the acting is bad ntheres not one solid performance in the film although williams as jax was pretty funny nafter a fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling jax says you look good in mud nno really you do nremar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang nbrian thompson who has played good guys bad guys and even an alien on tvs the xfiles but always some musclebound behemoth is your average evil demigod but its more the scripts fault than his own that he doesnt have anything original to say nthe one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and a half nanother thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking blood only appears in one scene nall in all mortal kombat annihilation is loud violent shallow and marketed toward kids nhey just like the video game n
warning spoilers are included in this review nbut it doesnt really make much of a difference ndeep impact begins the official summer movie season and it also brings back memories of 1997 nremember when dantes peak came out in february na few months later volcano was released nthe first film was smart exhilirating and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen nthe latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent nwell its deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition nthis time unfortunately the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon the upcoming cometdisaster to be released the beginning of july nof course the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine and so i am in the minority as i was when i stood on the side of dantes peak nbut while watching deep impact i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film napparently many did and it utterly baffles me nto be completely honest i havent had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life nvolcano had implausibilities up the wazoo but it was still rather fun to watch ndeep impact doesnt just have implausibilities it also contains cheap human drama incredibly horrible special effects and a poorly constructed plot nthe only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters ndeep impact begins in an unnamed year the year varies advanced technology sets it in the future but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater pushing it back to 1993 na line of students is outside at night peering through telescopes at the dark sky above namong these are leo biederman elijah wood and sarah hotchner leelee sobieski nleo unknowingly discovers a comet and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds nhe races off to mail the information but is killed in a reckless car accident na year passes and nothing is heard about it again nwe are then introduced to jenny lerner t a leoni a reporter for msnbc nshe gets handed a job to investigate a possible coverup in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse james cromwell nshe talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie nafter talking with rittenhouse and unsatisfied with the information she gets she decides to use the internet for help nluckily she knows exactly how to spell the certain ellie that she is looking for they spell it ele in the film nthat girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled nbefore she can use the information the government decides to push her car off the road nthey take her in to meet the president of the united states president beck morgan freeman nbeck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference nnaturally she wants to be compensated and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question nand so yada yada yada they reveal the comet to the public and their plans send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive nthey announce a plan called ark which is their only hope for survival na computer will select 800 000 people at random nthese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet wont kill off the entire human race nafter two years the dust will settle actually it would take much much longerapproximately ninety years from what i understand and the humans could come back to the surface and start over nthe rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures but there is one subplot worth mentioning njenny and her father jason maximilian schell have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom nthe final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional nits a shame that nothing else is heartfelt nnow of course we all know that the comet does impact the surface nthe title alone suggests it and the previews actually show it nby doing this absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it wont work ndirector mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show er nher major film debut was the peacemaker a pathetic and heartless action film nwell this time leder outdid herself creating a film worse than that one nsuggestion to ms leder please stay away from the big screen or at least the action genre nmuch of the blame can be placed on leder directly because the pace is disastrously off nthroughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed it goes from months to weeks to hours nit literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in realtimeits that boring nof course leder isnt all to blame for it nscreenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time nwhat starts out promising soon turns deadly for the audience anyway nchock full of cheesy one liners you know you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school nand stupid characters you might think we were back in the 70s again nonly one of the subplots is remotely interesting while the rest are forgettable and boring nand the main plot is so outrageous that you cant figure out if this film is supposed to be an action drama or scifi nto put it simply the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation nthats right 80 miss and 20 hit nscenes above the earth are well done and the orbiting ship is majestic nbut the comet is a huge mistake making it more laughable than frightening nthe concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough but thats forgiveable nwhat isnt forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface ngive me a break will ya nand of course the much hyped collision of comet and earth nwell it is far from spectacular and it makes independence day look brilliant nthe water rushing towards the land is effective but once it hits the continent the effects turn ridiculous ncgi water is used and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks nin fact i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days njust when we think visual effects cant be improved along comes a film to show that they really can and should be none thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leders direction which also influences the actors nleder loves to show the actors faces before and during moments of terror nthis reminded me of another action director renny harlin die hard 2 cliffhanger nbut harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations nleder likes to flaunt peoples fears via their faces but instead of coming off as sympathetic leder seems more of a sadist none moment has an astronaut flying off into space nthis should be enough to warrant a response from the audience but leder wants to go farther and shows us the persons face while drifting into space nthis is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience and i for one am not going to be fooled non another note leders film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts nthe pace does pick up and some very emotional moments are shown nthen again when you watch people cry for their loved ones its obvious it will be emotional nits mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into feeling for the characters but it didnt work for me nbut anyway the actors do as much as they can with what they are given nt a leoni bad boys tvs the naked truth is the best of the film and she is given the meatiest role nher character is made stronger by leonis presence and we grow to care for her nrobert duvall is energetic and fun to watch but his character is turned into shreds by the plot nelijah wood also comes off rather successfully but he still hasnt had many good roles wood stick to drama nyou are too talented for this stuff nvanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen nmaximilian schell is distracting but he does provide some nice humor nmorgan freeman has been infinitely better than this and gives one of his most shallow performances to date which is quite remarkable for him nleelee sobieski could have been better but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character na special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby neldard is good in his role but is limited by the plot ncrosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tvs star trek the next generation nseeing her was one of the highlights of the film noverall a very talented cast virtually wasted ndeep impact is rated pg13 for disaster related elements and brief language nthis is one of the worst films of the year and if it is any omen of things to come this summer could be one of the worst ever nluckily the xfiles movie is coming up and hopefully armageddon will be more successful nits a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isnt worth much ncosting nearly 75 million with special effects done by the illustrious ilm which is a huge shocker and with a score composed by oscarwinner james horner titanic one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience nwell its not nwhen the comet does hit the earth you almost wish it could just take this film along with it n
in my review of the spy who shagged me i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series it is followed by a third movie that is a bore nthe cause is probably complacency a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing n scream 3 provides the latest proof of this rule nin los angeles production has begun on stab 3 return to woodsboro the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott neve campbell nhowever life soon starts imitating art and stab cast members turn up stabbed nsmelling yet another book deal gale weathers courteney cox arquette comes to the set to investigate and finds her exboyfriend dewey riley david arquette acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer parker posey the actress playing gale in stab 3 elsewhere our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name n n nuntil she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice nthe late randy meeks jamie kennedy makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy nhe notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with nindeed scream 3 tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all the murder of sidneys mother maureen before the beginning of the original scream nat the scene of each murder in scream 3 the killer leaves a photo of sidneys mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer nto find out who the killer is our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureens missing years when she was a starlet appearing in lowbudget horror films n even with that little information you can probably already guess what the killers relationship to sidney is nunlike its predecessors scream 3 doesnt have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer nthe characters we do suspect are all undeveloped so that by the end we dont even care who the killer is nthe jaded detective patrick dempsey nthe kinky producer lance henriksen nthe driven young director scott foley nthe ingenue emily mortimer nthe character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random nwes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret so its quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen nthe series trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious npossibly its the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson who penned the first two or maybe its that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche ni groaned as an attack on sidney from the first scream was repeated momentformoment in the hollywood set of her home nat some point referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas n scream 3 also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles nlook for jenny mccarthy carrie fisher patrick warburton puddy from seinfeld roger corman and jason mewes and kevin smith as jay and silent bob to walk through at some point nall these bit players put forth more effort than the series returning stars who are probably saving their energy for the long post scream job search nanother prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass more movies are copying the blair witch project s web strategy n scream 3 has three official websites that wink wink pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie nthe sunrise studios site scream3 com has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the latest stab 3 news ntheres also a gail weathers official site galeweathers com and a sunrise sucks site that has more stab scandals the studio wants to cover up sunrisesucks com ncraven and company promise that this is the last installment in the scream series nwhile i hope thats true i dont hold out much hopehorror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters ntheres a halloween h2k in the works even though michael myers was beheaded in h20 and a freddy vs jason has been talked about for awhile despite the fact that both characters were killed off ntheres bound to be a scream 4 someday even if it starts over with a new set of moviestar wannabes nbottom line they should have called this one yawn n
synopsis a humorless police officers life changes when he befriends a supersmart superadorable golden retriever named einstein and a cute young blond scientist nunfortunately einstein shares a psychic link with a bigfootsized apecreature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine and this rogainenightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl nmeanwhile a group of white chainsmoking guntoting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie ncomments watchers reborn a cheaply made directtovideo turkey is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontzs bestselling novel watchers ntechnically this should have been called watchers v but it seems that this cycle of horror movies much like many other sequelcrazy film series has decided to drop the numbers from the titles n even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi nthe makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago nthis really isnt a good movie nhave you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation nwell any hope a viewer may have had perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill will be dashed by the time hes seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn ntheyre awful nthese commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer some weird crap about a dead indian teens and wolves and an action movie called detonator starring scott baio nscott baio nwhat idiot dreamed this movie up nafter surviving these abysmal trailers the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented watchers reborn n maybe it wont be that bad he may say to himself n perhaps just perhaps the bottomofthebarrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading nwatchers reborn after all is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago nit stars mark hamill luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy nlou rawls is even in the mix nunfortunately the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill he looks very sick here and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers the book nthe latter is really too bad nkoontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good but he is still my favorite hack writer nkoontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful npeople who read many of his books however often complain of repetitive plot devices nits definately not a koontz book if there isnt 1 a psychic 2 a superintelligent dog or 3 a psychotic killer who likes ripping out peoples eyeballs nwatchers has all three devices which may explain why its arguably the most popular of koontzs books nthe idea behind koontzs novel though highly implausible is very interesting nbasically a biological war machine is created a smart dog can be released in battle track down its target and then relay the targets position psychically to a large creature designed to kill in handtohand combat nsilly but kind of neat too nim sorry ni dont mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn the movie ni suppose i just dont want to talk about the movie itself nthis turkey is really cheesy nno one in this movie can act including mark hamill and its difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero nthe cheese factor is only increased when hes involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist geneticist zoologist whateverthef kshessupposedtobe whom he befriends nmercifully the filmmakers opted not to do nudity nto be honest the only halfconvincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein nyou know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts ni find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie nand the creature nyes the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling nthis creature is shot about 500 000 times but its okay nthe creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing noh he can also rip body parts off allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around ncheesy gore nthats another main element of watchers reborn nit has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the films campiness rather than its suspense nultimately i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror scifi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the films silliness though this film will tax even their patience its an 83 minute film but it feels like four hours nalso i hate to admit i have survived far worse than this nanyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin fear the rush will know what i mean nfinally i couldnt help but think that watchers reborn would work well as bot fodder for the creative folks behind one of my alltime favorite shows mystery science theater 3000 nthis thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face nrated r watchers reborn contains dozens of bloodspattered bodies and unconvincing gore nit also has violence obviously ni wouldnt recommend it for the little kids but im sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay ninstead of watching this film however i recommend reading koontzs book ntrust me itll be time much much better spent n
mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla nhis entrance however is a grand one out from the trees he leaps gargantuan and imposing sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have njoe bellows at the poachers before him angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars nduring this scene i turned to my friend and said wow nthats some ape njoe is quite a gorilla a big digital gorilla nhe runs around the fields chasing cars and people nhe picks things up and stares at them pensively nhe breaks things on accident because hes just too big to avoid clumsiness njoe as a special effect is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes nas a character he doesnt quite register nand the story hes been put in is as limp as they come nthe words family entertainment have never been a stamp of quality but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart nthe picture is a remake of the 1949 film nits mostly just about the big gorilla but strictly as a formality the movie also has a few human characters nthe main one is jill young poor charlize theron forced to waste her talent a lover of gorillas nas a child she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother now she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife nspecifically shes out to protect joe a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood nsoon zoologist gregg ohara bill paxton discovers joe he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser rade sherbedgia who just happens to be the same guy who killed jills mother nso in an effort to save joe jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers nin addition the space is way too small for him after all he is a really big gorilla nand to add to the complications strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jills mother njill of course doesnt recognize strasser even though he did kill her mother nthis is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film nthe movie isnt really offensive it has some competent actors a few nifty sets and a lot of scenes with a big digitized gorilla nbut the story is really dumb there arent any characters and the film isnt satisfying on any level beyond its visuals nthe movie also has bad dialogue nif a critic says that a film has bad dialogue its only fair to quote some of it but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like joe isnt happy nand joe isnt safe here n we need to get joe out of here n joe is way too big for that cage ni dont know if these phrases are word for word but theyre close nas i said the characters here are only present as a formality they do little more than state the obvious of course joe is too big for that cage npaxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them nsadly mighty joe young wastes them both nthere are a few clever moments although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment and as i said the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes nits certainly not a bad film for kids i doubt joe will give them nightmares nbut adults in the audience arent likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla na big gorilla is only interesting for a little while after that something needs to be done with the big gorilla nnobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla n
in the interest of being generous i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black nsir anthony hopkins playing a superrich media mogul has gathered his family around him for dinner nhis oldest daughter played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes nhopkins frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair does what any man in his position would do he punts nwhichever one you like dear he says nand the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do she cries ni liked that scene for two reasons nfirst the cakes looked really cool nsecond it was perhaps the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act nmeet joe black is chockfull of odd performances people doing things for no discernible reason at all and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot nits easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani but its even easier to sleep right through it two people on my row managed it quite nicely nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess ni know my audience had problems with the movie because they thought it was a comedy ncase in point everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie nhowever the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani n its not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death but it makes a certain kind of sense nit shouldnt take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr pitt nand indeed they do after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished nwell when that happened the audience howled with laughter and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous nso if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawingroom humor are funny i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately nanyway the deceased lawyers body no worse the wear from its massive injuries is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role nthe idea is that death given the pen name of joe black so as not to disturb others wants to take a holiday and experience the world nif this werent hollywood we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death but since it is we get scene after scene of fishoutofwater humor just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck whos wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesnt know how to act in our society nit also doesnt help that the character of death is written so inconsistently nhe claims to be on vacation but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani just try to get your travel agent to book that one nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois nhe knows everything about some characters nothing about others nand as played by brad pitt hes not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing hes just there nits as if someone told pitt never mind about acting in this picture son just stand there and look pretty nits as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie nive used the phrase angel of death in this review very deliberately to contrast pitts performance with this years best angel performance nicolas cages in city of angels nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man pitt is aloof and arrogant ncage struck instant chemical sparks with costar meg ryan where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlanis character is so shallow that she cant see beyond pitts good looks nthe movies other top name is a much better actor but that doesnt save meet joe black nsir anthony hopkins isnt given much better material to work with unfortunately nhe plays one of these goodhearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood n one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkinss character more realistically evil nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world nof course no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder nbut i have to wonder and in this movie you have a very long time to wonder how you or i would act in a similar situation especially if you or i were a multimillionaire nhopkins pretty much goes to the office and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated im sure ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black and im asking myself why nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest which is what im going to do now ngo spend time with your family go volunteer for a local charity heck go take a nap ndont go see meet joe black because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death n curtis edmonds n no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it n sideshow bob n
one of the responses those that enjoy detroit rock city probably kiss fans mostly might have upon first glance at the rating ive given the film might be something like oh that caseys gone and become a jaded critic on us njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n roll movie like this nim wondering the same thing ni feel like i should have had a grand time with detroit rock city nits the sort of movie i wish i couldve had a lot of fun with but i didnt ni just didnt nsurely this film isnt trying to win any major awards so should i have expected an oscarcaliber film nno but i expected something na funny joke na clever prank na plot development nanything nthe movie never delivers nyouve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing n detroit rock city is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the films existence and its not a very satisfying realization nthe film is about four teenage boys all huge kiss fans from cleveland trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit michigan nthats it nthere is no big plot description in this review because the movie has very little plot nthe characters are hawk edward furlong lex giuseppe andrews trip james debello and jam sam huntington nthey have a garage band ntheyre pathetic like all garage bands but they like kiss and they like rock n roll so i guess that means we root for them nthey have tickets they lose them nthey get more tickets they lose those too nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets most of which backfire ntheres not much more to it nfrankly it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys hands only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity noh and jam real name jeremiah has a really really annoying ultrareligious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency nshe doesnt want them to see kiss if you hadnt figured that out already nits really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this nweve got plenty of kiss along with some acdc ramones and thin lizzy nthen again maximum overdrive had an awesome soundtrack me being the big acdc fan that i am but is probably one of the worst movies of all time n detroit rock city doesnt quite reach that level of ineptitude but it gets dangerously close nin fact the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind nbasically the soundtrack has earned the film a full halfstar which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back except for marilyn manson whose halfhearted cover of acdcs highway to hell sounds like something my neighbors cat coughed up nits also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste because it s evident that theyre all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie nedward furlong has done far better work than this and so has natasha lyonne and so has lin shaye but hey theyve got to make a living in hollywood npeople wanting to see kiss and lots of it will probably be disappointed considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song ntoo bad they might have provided some energy to this mess ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasnt got much material to work with so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning nwe get an endless parade of quickcuts splitscreens zoomouts zoomins and rotating cameras all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script nits fun for a while but eventually it becomes disorienting ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at the blair witch project stay far away from detroit rock city because the witch has got nothing on this baby ni havent felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since armageddon nand what about that script nits written by carl j dupr which sounds like as madeup a name as ive ever heard nif it is i cant say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible na plotless pointless rock n roll movie can be fun if the jokes and gags are actually funny nthe jokes in detroit rock city rarely are nin fact the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuanalaced pizza and that was just because it was so surreal nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it comedy nthere is no setup just a succession of punchlines that dont provide for much in the way of chuckles precisely because there was no setup nits as if they just whacked someone on the head pointed at him and said see nfunny nlook that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink nsee nfunny nlook that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver ntwice nsee nfunny nlook that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money nsee nfunny na word of advice to mr dupr no these things arent funny all by themselves nthey must be preceded by a clever setup so the audience hasn t predicted them five minutes in advance nthats it ive said enough about this movie nits a waste of time and money ni liked the music but dont bother buying the soundtrack ni hear it s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie nyou want to see this concept executed well ngo rent roger cormans 1979 classic rock n roll high school nit features another lateseventies rock band the ramones and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show nyes go rent that and skip detroit rock city which will probably bomb and deservedly so n
my first press screening of 1998 and already ive gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list nwhat an auspicious beginning nwelcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l a and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere nfirestorm the directorial debut of dances with wolvess academy award winning cinematographer dean semler is the first of the new years crop of movies nas our story opens the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are smokejumpers nwe then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl where one of the gungho guys is taking a romance quiz from cosmopolitan nhaving the time of their lives they then jump into the middle of a burning forest nwhen even in the beginning the director cant get the small parts right you can sense the movie is in trouble nwith the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasolinefilled cars smokejumper monica christianne hirt tells them to get away from their soontoexplode vehicles nnot bothering to shout nor even get close to them she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people nmiraculously they manage to hear her and move away nin a movie that specializes in cheap shots the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building nas it does throughout overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girls face nour shows two heroes the crews chief wynt perkins played laconically by scott glenn and his secondincommand jesse graves played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal enter the burning house looking for the little girl nin a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames nthe manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse nthis mawkish show cuts back to monica who has a lifeordeath decision to make nthe chopper with the fireretardant chemicals has only enough to save one group nwill it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monicas two firefighting buddies nshe has only seconds to decide who will be saved nyes she goes for the majority but miracle of miracles the other three come out alive anyway nnot content with a traditional firefighting story chris soths screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape n hoods in the woods is what the groundpounders yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire nalong the way shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father who was a marine drill instructor nmost of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing nhe flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck narguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside nusing a ramp he shoots straight out of the top of the buildings attic and when he hits the ground he just rides off in a cloud of dust nwhen the film isnt using some stock footage of actual forest fires the simulated ones look hokey neditor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions nthe ending with its sick twists manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie nperhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby its not as bad as some of the television sitcoms nfirestorm runs mercifully just 1 29 nit is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers n

wow a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever nim amazed that someone thought this was a story that must be told on screen nmany blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race ni think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sexcrazed buffoons neven im offended by it nbill bellamy is a player which means he sleeps with a lot of women and lies to them nwhat a pleasant main character none day his friends decide that they want to find out how to be a player nwhy they decide this one day i have no idea nhow many years have they been friends and why all of a sudden would they want to learn nanyway bellamy agrees to teach and his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex with women nthis is the bulk of the film folks guys riding from house to house one keeps getting out to have sex while the others sit in the car nsince russell simmons is producer and since the official title of the film is def jams how to be a player i was ready to be jumping up and down and stomping my feet and beating the person next to me because of the comedy namazingly aside from gilbert gottfrieds 90 seconds of screen time there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner ninstead of jokes theres just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts and naked breasts arent so bad but naked breasts alone dont make a good movie nbe sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well ngilbert gottfrieds character serves as one in his very brief appearance asking for explanations as to what is being said nthey should have brought him along for the entire film nr n
its amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest standup around but completely fall flat in the movies ntake adam sandler non the basis of his first two cds theyre all gonna laugh at you nand what the hell happened to me nhes the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams nbut when you put him in front of a camera it just isnt the same ni kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation but his latest film the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal nseriously im willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here nin fact i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic nthe first half hour generated not one smile in me with its scenes of emotional abuse towards adams character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players but also by his very disturbed mother kathy bates what is the world coming to ngranted after the film gets rolling there are a few mild chuckles throughout im even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for its nearly hour and a half running time nyoure all familiar with the plot because youve seen it at least a million times before everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves nand believe me im not giving anything away by saying that sandlers team wins nif you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie then god be with you nthe only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobbys love interest ni mean they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose but they do extremely well with what they are given here nkudos to both of them nmy advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin who made a very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen nrely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh nor maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have like jim carrey did with the recent truman show nwith the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses he just cant keep going on like this n

coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers relentless 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz played by character actor leo rossi spawned three more sequels nrelentless 3 third in the row features sam dietz again but this time detective who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case doesnt want to deal with similar line of work ndivorced demoralised and transferred he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer and evidence indicate connection with one of dietzs old cases nto make things even more interesting it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation nfans of the british tv films and miniseries like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies nthey both feature vicious psychopathic killers yet also give a lot of usually depressive details about chief investigators private lives nthis one isnt an exception but similarities with british television are only in content nthe execution and style is different which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best nuseless gratuitous erotica also doesnt help either obviously making this film longer than it should be nthe actors are good though leo rossi is fine as usual and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career nsigny coleman as dietzs love interest is on the other hand quite miscast nbut she wont have to worry about it in the future career since relentless 3 wasnt supposed to be anybodys finest moment anyway n
come on hollywood surprise me nstop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset nthe always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls npersonal because his niece is one of the victims nits a slobbering psychopath of course but this time theres a twist nfreeman notes that each of the young women whove disappeared are all strong willed assertive and more successful in their careers than the average girl nwe soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova whose aim is to dominate these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem nanyway one of the women manages to escape ashly judd and teams up with freeman to well nyou know the rest na brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story nperhaps but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue nso lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further okay nand as for comparisons to seven oh nplease nkiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass nmaybe the novel was a stinker to start with but whatever the case its the writing thats clearly at fault here none these characters have very little to say thats engaging or interesting ntwo the script has no sense of humour nthree while the notion of a psychos victims being smart successful women is an interesting twist the execution isnt even half as good as the idea nthus ashly judd comes across all out of focus instead of being the heart of the story nwe cant feel her rage nsome atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that shes the nobullshit 90s type but these conversations barely register nand as for freeman kiss the girls is his second dog in a year first chain reaction now this nfor an actor of his calibre this is most worrying nyoung director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fictionesque things to do in denver when your dead nbut what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this nnot much and you can hardly blame him ntheres a few wellstaged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls dives and jumps and the effect is startling nbut the script is beyond rescue nwhat hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up ncomplacency rules its been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue nthe only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie positive proof that the best things in life arent free n n

my giant begins with a monologue thats more funny than not and a distinctive princess bride medieval fairytaleinthe 90s feel ni was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy billy crystal is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream nand when sammy meets max his giant mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan there is magic in the air albeit it a bit goofy i loved every minute of it nthe film of course plays on the size difference between the two and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects ni particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a maxsized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons ni also liked jere burns from tvs something so right performance as the director of the film in romania nat this point the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand particularly during his fastpaced first scene nit is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech nhowever about the time muresan becomes coherent the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive noff the high board nsuddenly we are expected to believe sammy is a dowhateverittakes slime ball nup until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure but he didnt come off as a desperate jerk nif he had the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical nbut now in new york we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs midgets wrestling match which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film nindeed many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces nthis includes the scenes featuring steven seagal when sammy gets max a role in a big hollywood movie filming in las vegas nwhile i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation rather than because the film demanded it nand the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare nat this point i found myself thinking were supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film nthen i realized he was and i was watching it nin the final third the film undergoes another transformation this time to unbridled sentimentality nnote major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph nmax went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love lillianna who hasnt seen him since he was a normalsized kid nher refusal to see max unbeknownst to him leads us to an awkward ends justify the means scene as sammys wife serena played nicely by kathleen quinlan poses as lillianna ni found this scene offensive nnot only did it rely on deception to induce warm fuzzy feelings from the audience it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle which i thought was quite undeserved ni think max could have handled the truth gratuitous illness and all nlate in the film we learn max and in fact all giants have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably nthis could be an enlightening revelation but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammys transformation into a caring sensitive guy and hey a great dad and husband too nmy giant suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions na stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on maxs struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammys struggles to get money and become a better person nin this scenario maxs illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator nsentiment and emotion would have followed naturally ninstead were apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end but were not allowed to focus on max ncrystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances but in the end my giant left me feeling like id been fed gruel from a giant spoon n
i didnt come into city of angels expecting greatness nive never seen wim wenders wings of desire the classic movie upon which city is loosely based nthen again i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device with the little mermaid both the disney version and the original folktale being among them that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold nunfortunately city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them nthe plot for those that couldnt tell from the previews revolves around the angel seth played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage who in the midst of his angelic duties falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally nof course his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her watch her buy groceries only to disappear in the blink of an eye ntheir love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human nusing this framework as a jumpingoff point the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire the joys of being human and the definition of perfection nthe first half of the movie succeeds on most points ncage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesnt know feelings so cant really express preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hangdog expressions nunfortunately cage takes the intensity too far sometimes and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive nas maggie ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right nher beauty unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss is mature intelligent and winning nlikewise some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film nwhen the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel nthe beautiful camera work shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel nthe film begins to lose its way though when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie nthe grand angelic perspective gets lost except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angels eyes nthe movie devolves into an examination of how seth cant feel the world or more importantly he cant feel maggie he cant smell her hair feel her touch or taste the pears she eats nthis change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seths intense longing but in doing so the conflict disappears nif he wants maggie so badly then why doesnt her just make the leap and become human nafter all whats so great about being an angel nsure you get to sit on marlboro signs but whats that compared to getting to be with meg ryan nand from there once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur its all downhill nthe philosophy becomes heavyhanded the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audiences hankie nits the last thirty minutes of the movie then that wrecks the film ni feel like the writer by pulling out all the melodramatic stops has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level ni came out feeling robbed seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing ni could go on longer but i dont want to ruin the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on ncity of angels then is a paradox nits a wellacted particularly look for dennis franz cutting against typecasting as a happygolucky fallen angel wellfilmed and based on a wonderful idea nall these possibilities though are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up n
for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones it is surprising to find the messenger the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess nin the early to mid 1400s there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman nthe church was a dismally dark and oppressive place nfrance was involved in the hundred years war against england nthere was no strong political leadership in the country nmorale was low there being little hope for the future nit was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing voices and seeing visions nconvinced that these were messages from god she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him nthe message if he would give her an army to command she would deliver to him the crown nhe does nand she does nthen once seated on the throne he abandons her to her english captors ndirector luc besson the fifth element may have cowrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material nthe inconsistencies of the cast the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes the inappropriate musical score and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable nhis biggest miscue was to cast his wife milla jovovich the fifth element in the title role nms jovovich looks spectacular as joan clad in battle armor astride a similarly protected horse nif looks were enough to fully convey a character she would have been brilliant nsince it isnt she tried and failed to act the part nher joan is unbalanced inspiring the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed njohn malkovich being john malkovich fares a bit better as the dauphin who joan would see on the throne as charles vii nan easily manipulated man his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death nfaye dunaway the thomas crown affair gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphins motherinlaw and chief advisor nthe army under joans command are comprised of comical figures more stooges than soldiers nthe one exception would be tcheky karyo la femme nikita as dunois the man who was leading the attack prior to joans arrival ntrying to plan a systematic campaign he sees his leadership authority negated by joans insistence on following her visions ndustin hoffman sphere has a small inhuman role as joans conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial ndressed like cloaked monk he leads her to doubt herself and her revelations nas well she should nscriptures do speak of revelation ngod via his gift of holy spirit is able to communicate to men nthree of the nine manifestations of holy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation nthey are word of knowledge word of wisdom and discerning of spirits neven the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his holy men nwho spake as they were moved by holy spirit i e nby revelation nbut the scriptures also caution us n beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world n1 john 4 1 kjv njoans end being burned at the stake at the age of 19 the frenzy mob rule and blood lust her inspiration wrought and the death pain or suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rather than a godly one nwhile her conviction and intense believing remains an admirable quality she was as others have been before and since misled by the spiritual master of deception nas a messenger she was quite effective nshe was just confused as to whose message she was carrying n

there are scenes in the big hit that are so awful they simply defy description nthe movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made last action hero 1993 such a chore to sit through npresumably the big hit is an actioncomedy a difficult but not impossible genre to pull off nmovies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence n lethal weapon 2 1989 is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very very funny nunfortunately in the big hit it seems that comedy is the main motive and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs nunfortunately there are no laughs nthe movie resembles some of the goofy throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films but it doesnt benefit from chans incredible stunts and goofy charismatic presence ninstead we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg who must have considered himself invincible after his criticallyacclaimed performance in last years boogie nights nhowever if he wants to maintain a decent career he had better start selecting his projects more carefully movies like this are a surefire recipe for a long career in the straighttovideo market nwahlberg plays melvin smiley an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman see grosse pointe blank for the same character much better developed nthe movie wants us to think gee how clever and ironic a guy who can kill without any moral implications and yet he cant stand for anyone not to like him nthe fact is melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee christina applegate with a horrendous new york accent and an abusive girlfriend lela rochon who is only using him for his money nhis constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst nmelvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris avery brooks as part of a team of hitmen which also includes cisco lou diamond phillips and crunch bokeem woodbine none day melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi sab shimono for a million dollar ransom nhowever not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movie inside joke get it but his kidnapped daughter keiko china chow also happens to be paris goddaughter nso when paris finds out shes been kidnapped he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it nnot knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper nof course cisco blames the whole thing on poor innocent melvin nalong the way there are several obligatory gunfights explosions and car chases plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by jurassic park and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko who looks like shes barely pushing fifteen nwhat the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers harakiri drinking problems leaking body bags and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation and now spends all his time doing hand exercises nnot to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of king kong lives which is two weeks overdue nthis mess of a movie was helmed by chekirk wong the latest hong kong director imported by john woo faceoff who also served as executive producer nwoo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors and start making more of his own films nwong who directed such films as rocknroll cop back in hong kong is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy nmaybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean but theyre not here at least in the manner wong handles them nmany of the problems can be traced back to the script which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey nin addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences ramseys script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar poetic rhythms of tarantino or mametstyle dialogue nwhat he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips whose favorite phrase is its all love and robin dunne who plays ciscos stuttering blackwannabe assistant nthe irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale which can pretty much describe the film as a whole n

a movie that without credits is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour n the whole nine yards is an ultimately unsatisfying and emptyheaded excursion into wellworn terrain already set by far superior pictures nhow the cast most of which are respectable actors got caught up in such a cliched deficient film remains a mystery unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynns 1985 comedy classic clue the movie ngoing into the theater preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable but by the twentyminute mark when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time it was clear this production was in serious trouble nsince the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot and the screenplay inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner collapses with every failing comedy bit the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and frequently entertainment value n the whole nine yards is neither facetious nor aside from the subplot about jills shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman inventive and more often than not just lies there the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector but never igniting any sort of spark na few select actors do what they can with the material while others make no impact at all non the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters matthew perry and bruce willis nperry innocuously enjoyable on tvs friends plays the same exact sitcomstyle character in all of his movies from 1997s fools rush in to 1999s three to tango and it has become a crushing bore nmeanwhile willis makes next to no impression and because of the limited guise of his jimmy the tulip tudeski oftentimes disappears into the background ntheir three female counterparts fare noticeably better nbest of all is natasha henstridge far more radiant than in the exploitative species movies who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia nhenstridge has the talent for sure to break out of these countless throwaway roles but first she must fire her agent namanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who thus far has strived on a career based solely on comedy nit is too bad then that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts nfinally rosanna arquette is awful as sophie but something tells me that was her purpose and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time nalso popping up is michael clarke duncan fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in the green mile as jimmys largely built friend and fellow killer frankie figs nwhen the whole nine yards eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit na great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films so what was the point nwithout a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments the whole nine yards rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast and half of the actors are not charming at all nnow what does that tell you n

in 1970s many european intellectuals especially those on the left political hemisphere became obsessed with the rise of fascism nwhich wasnt so hard to expect because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies nin such times when political involvement could be associated with noble passion many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of prewar europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany nof course there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other less noble reasons nfor them moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era nwhich naturally made some of those films very popular among teen audience none of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass who later made career shooting expensive stylish soft porn nsalon kitty his 1976 film is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2 nin 1939 walter schellenberg one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats nnone of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents and that all the rooms happened to be bugged nthe most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty nominal madame of the brothel didnt know the real purpose of that enterprise nscreenplay by tinto brass of course simplifies the story and changes few names nschellenberg is now wallenberg helmut berger ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top nkitty kellerman ingrid thulin apart from being madam has a second job as a cabaret singer ncaught in the net of depravity is sweet innocent girl margerithe theresa ann savoy thrown into brothel nthere she falls in love with customer hans reiter bekim fehmiu disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe nwhen margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel she finds out that the place is bugged nshe informs the madam of the real situation and both women decide to confront wallenberg nthose who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation nbut although salon kitty doesnt happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn although not very successful some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict this time between powerhungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty nunfortunately brass seems to overuse other cinematical references probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino viscontis the damned but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulins unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minellis musical numbers from cabaret nall in all salon kitty is failure although with some very interesting moments n
upon first viewing of this movie the phrases been there and done that come quickly to mind nspy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series nstealing stuff can be profitable in this industry but only when you steal the right stuff nwhat little plot there is involves dick steele aka nagent wd40 leslie nielsen trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith nalong the way to it goal goal the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act nthe trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny or at the least satirical nspy hard achieves neither as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films nthe dick the world is in danger nwhat is it nwell its a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun n im paraphrasing type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film each time getting progressively less funny nwhat they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brothers films while writing their own dialogue ndirector rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors especially nielsen who can do this quite well than on the delivery and context of their lines much of the time cutting the punchline short nthe whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over as is evident in the final sequence where there is no comedic denouement after the climax nas was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context none of the more amusing was captain of the enterprise james nt kirk noverall i thought this was a very weak effort nwhile all of the right films to spoof were chosen they used none of the right spoofing methods nnext time they should spy a little bit harder n excellent none of a kind nmust see n entertaining nworth the price of admission n fair nnothing much special n what were they thinking n

 jack frost is one of those dumb corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching nthis does not come as a surprise since the studio that made it is warner brothers who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other njack frost michael keaton is a struggling middleaged rock musician who loves his wife gabby kelly preston and 11yearold son charlie joseph cross but doesnt spend nearly enough time with them nwhen he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas nhalfway there jack has second thoughts but on his way back home is in a car accident and dies nswitch forward a year christmas is approaching once again and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jacks death nwhen charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died the snowman outside the house is taken over by jacks spirit njack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise n frosty the snowman is a classic cartoon and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated but as a liveaction film it doesnt work at all nafter a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established jack frost quickly goes downhill especially once the snowman comes into play nsince jack has been deceased for a whole year you would think there would be many questions to ask him such as what happens after you die nor how does it feel to be a snowman nbut instead the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie nthe performances are respectable enough but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this nmichael keaton at least got off easy since he disappears after the first twenty minutes but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here ni have always liked kelly preston nshe is clearly a talented charismatic actress but has never been given a good role in her life usually having to settle for a onedimensional supporting character as in 1997s nothing to lose and addicted to love njoseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent nin one of the only subplots that actually works due to its wittiness henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman nthis brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side however by the triedandtrue main plot at hand which is the sappy story of a father and son nsince i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid cringeinducing lines of dialogue nsome of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father you da man says charlie n no i da snowman replies jack nor how about this little zinger coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out snowdad is better than no dad ndo people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this nthe snowman created by john hensons creature shop is more believable than the snowman from last years unintentionally hilarious directtovideo horror flick also called jack frost but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects neither way it was an awful lot of work to go through just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project nas a seasonal holiday picture jack frost is pretty much a clunker na better christmas film from this year is ill be home for christmas nbetter yet my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film such as its a wonderful life a christmas story or prancer n jack frost is an earnest but severely misguided film and children as well as adults deserve better ni doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent anyway n
the job of the film critic is to see a movie and write a review of it that tells you what its about and why its good or bad ni feel kind of embarrassed to admit this but i after having seen get carter i really cant tell you what its about although i could go on and on about how and why its a bad movie n get carter falls into that category of movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room nyou might call them the steven seagalmickey rourkejeanclaude van dammewesley snipes school of mediocre actioncrime thrillers nyou know the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights shootouts and car chases but really light on plot and character development nthey have stories where the socalled hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight chase or shoot at nsylvester stallone stars as jack carter a las vegasbased mob enforcer who returns home for his brothers funeral nhe believes his brother richie was taken out and didnt die from a dwi accident ncarters one of the most cliche badasses ever captured on celluloid nhis face alone is pretty intimidating and theres quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his ramboontestosteronetherapy voice nstallones performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesnt realize hes mocking himself nthe actual story involves carters investigation into his brother richies death nhes in a town thats not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well nmickey rourke costars as one of these characters a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman ntheres also another plot involving richies mistress a secret cdrom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carters stillliving relatives nim rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible ni could just rip the screenplay to shreds plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all ni dont like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally nyes get carter is just that complicated and complex nand whats worse is that its not this intricate to make it seem smart like the usual suspects for example just the opposite nyou get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didnt remember what had already happened and didnt figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax nall you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another asking them what they know getting information and then realizing that if he wasnt a complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes nalthough the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another nmaking a movie entirely about criminals doesnt necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters nmel gibson starred in payback a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldnt help but like him even though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter nso ultimately get carter fails for pretty much every selling point it has ncarter is not a likable character and you really dont care if he gets revenge or not nthe action sequences are not at all exciting or original nthe enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all cmon you know whos going to win every brawl and shootout and car chase nin the end you dont feel nearly satisfied with the results nthe filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible n the city is never mentioned by name but i assume its seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and its always raining n
possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk nit smashed u s box office office records in its opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here nbut is it any good nin a word no nill elaborate further nthe story is as follows napparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on none where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened n see jurrasic park nimgen the company that funded jurrasic park want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to a new attraction in san diago nrealizing what a bad idea this is proffessor john hammond richard attenborough decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs so as to rally public support to preserve the island nenter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there nso basically what you have is this ntwo teams one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other trying to document them being forced to work together fighting for survival against the dinosaurs firm intentions on eating them na fairly good idea however its let down by one slight problem nits crap nover two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring way too quiclky nadd to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested nit becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like whats for tea and should you cut the lawn later n yes you should nits a shame then really that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park nwith only a few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous c g i ndinosaurs the t rexs have to be seen to be believed there is nothing else to recommend the lost world na very dissapointing sequel indeed n
gregg arakis the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made nso why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus nfirst of all some of the reviews were fairly positive nalso the cast consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars including christopher knight eve plumb shannen doherty and david leisure was promising nlast of all i wanted to give arraki one more chance ni mean the guy cant be that untalented can he nthe answer to that question is three letters long nnowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles nsince arraki doesnt know how to make anything coherent its hard to describe the plot nlets just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend wont make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls nthe only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star nhe turns out to be a nice guy who doesnt care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans nthis story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming nit is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez ni thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft nhe works better with the camera this time around especially in the early scenes nhalfway through the film i didnt necessarily find myself enjoying the film but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation nthen as the movie went on arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads twisted sex games and alien abductions nits sad because he almost actually had some decent material here but he ruined it with his usual in your face im such a renegade maverick filmmaker look what i can do attitude nthe performances are generally better than in the doom generation which isnt saying much nat least we dont have to suffer jonathan i am the most hideous man in america schaech nwe are however treated to another round of james im more wooden than keanu duval nsarah lassez gives the best performance in the film and kathleen robertson formerly of 90210 and now arrakis wife and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess nof the tv star cameos john ritter is the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist nif i prefer nowhere to the doom generation it is only in the way that i would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture nmaybe greg arraki doesnt want you to like his characters nmaybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them nmaybe he just wanted to piss me off nif so he was successful n
the first species was a moderatelysuccessful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects a few well paced action sequences and frequent views of modelturnedactress natasha henstridge sans clothing nhowever it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel nand considering the quality of species 2 its obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead nthe only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is nif you throw away the plot which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence logic coherence and consistency species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience nof course that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys who at least in theory shouldnt be able to get into an r rated film and connoisseurs of bad movies ntheres enough blood gore simulated sex and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring nthis is a grade z exploitation flick thats ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment nsomewhere someplace i recall hearing species 2 described as erotic ni would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie because he or she has a peculiar notion of eroticism nsure theres a lot of sex and nudity but its almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a womans abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free splattering blood and gore in all directions nanyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater ni suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge and to get the obvious question out of the way yes she does remove her top but only once and only briefly nalthough the character she played in the original species is dead government scientists still have the dna and out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse they decide to create another clone nthis creature dubbed eve by its creator dr laura baker played by marg helgenberger reprising her role is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile nmeanwhile man has finally set foot on mars na team of three led by patrick ross justin lazard has traveled to the red planet but when they return to earth they bring something with them nross has become a halfhumanhalfalien hybrid and hes soon mating like crazy collecting the bloodsoaked children that are the result of each sex session nhis intention is obviously world domination nstanding in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film preston lennox michael madsen and one of patricks fellow astronauts dennis gamble mykelti williamson nbut when patrick learns about eve a female of his kind theres no damping his ardor nim not sure what the budget for species 2 was but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors as opposed to being diverted into the special effects nmichael madsen and marg helgenberger both back for a second round are clearly on hand to do as little as they can grab the money and run nditto for james cromwell who plays patricks father underused is too kind a word to describe his involvement invisible would be more like it ngeorge dzundza gets to do a little scenery chewing as an angrybutinept general nmeanwhile justin lazards performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridges limited abilities look good by comparison nthe only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick ncomplete with cheesy special effects bare breasts around every narrative corner and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics ndirector peter medak a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume has added another forgettable title but at least he appears to have had fun doing it which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness ndo i recommend the movie nabsolutely not but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didnt try my patience to the degree that some pseudointellectual bad movies do nheres hoping theres no species 3 n
wolfgang petersens latest the perfect storm is like a pineapple nit only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging if you try to eat the fruit spikes and all its going to hurt quite a bit nok maybe that was a confusing analogy so heres my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick there isnt really much of a story to tell nbasically a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat called the andrea gail and gets stuck in the middle of the storm of the century nhow much time does it take for petersen to tell this story nnot nearly enough nso he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous naudiences want to see the storm they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched maudlin drivel nthe last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect but just try lasting the first threequarters ni have yet to read sebastian jungers the perfect storm but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale nbased on a true story the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version the approach is weak nusing a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner petersen almost hides the inyourface banality nright away the central characters are introduced the gritty determined captain george clooney the ingenue mark wahlberg torn between his job and his girlfriend diane lane the loving father john c reilly the comic relief whos always trying to get laid john hawkes the new guy william fichtner who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet french guy allen payne nso many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer nit is not the allstar casts fault just the characters designed for their portrayal nallen paynes character never speaks in the entire movie not because he is mute but because hes never given any lines nare we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with nfichtners character is terribly underdeveloped we dont know what hes doing there where hes from or who hes supposed to be nthe remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene you know what would look good on you nme nooooh real creative nas the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters the crew continues to not feel human nonly when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk nthe computergenerated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real ni can only imagine if this was an imax film this city kid would surely never go in the water again nthis is loud jolting entertainment adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film nthe perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment nthe maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so ni guess ill stick to that other survival spectacle you know the one on cbs n
guilt guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time the penultimate t a thriller basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living nbut i know so well that its a terrible film made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt nverhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and on november seventh 1997 unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies nthe pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year na simple white on black title card reads starship troopers my friends and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped verhoeven realized he forgot the credits nis this how a hundred million dollar movie should open nwere the rest of the film that subdued nstarship troopers is about a group of white blondhaired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names nthey graduate high school join the military and then rather curiously decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet nthe story is so incomprehensible and told so bombastically its akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue n aside club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasnt changed in the future none plus starship troopers contains some very funny sequences specifically the newsreels of the future nhysterically funny actually nbut the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between nthe storytelling lacks focus to say the least nthe politics of the film are scary nthe actions of the major female characters are dictated by their outofcontrol libidos ntheres even a creepy sex scene the lovely dina meyer makes out nude with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater just the way he seems to like it ni use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor ive encountered in a big budget picture all chiseled features and machismo he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders nof course verhoevens probably the one to blame and perhaps im jealous because im so disgusting nat any rate a movie called starship troopers shouldnt be about sex nexactly ten years ago verhoeven made robocop which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving nand rrated despite its goofy premise nmaybe its asking too much for verhoeven to make a pgmovie thenhes a master of insipid violence nhowever ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it n
michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels many of which are science fiction nthe most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel nso in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a bigbudget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel ncongo failed and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better nit a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good nthe film is expensive over one hundred million dollars is long 133 minutes has a terrific cast including dustin hoffman samuel l jackson and sharon stone but has little that is really original and less that is exciting nseveral years ago dr norman goodman played by dustin hoffman was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered nthe plan he wrote was only semiserious but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien nnow that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes peter coyote to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s nsuddenly normans less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft nincluded in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams samuel l jackson biologist beth halperin sharon stone and astrophysicist ted fielding liev schreiber ntogether they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets none major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of goldtoned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship nwhat is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances ndirector barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects nthe problem here is he is making a bigbudget science fiction film nit has some effects but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen nthe technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewers imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting nthat could be a reasonable approach in a lowbudget film nbut that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster nit requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put they dont nhoffmans acting seems muted njackson seems to laid back nwe do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads nlevinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance nand why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybodys guess a ncast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price nlook how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors nmost science fiction spectaculars these days have secondtier actors and firsttier special effects nlevinson tries secondtier effects and firsttier actors but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer nperhaps scifi spectaculars are just not an actors medium nthe result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the 4 to 4 scale n

there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs none is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film ntwo is never greenlight a scifi film starring john travolta nto wit we present the disaster that is battlefield earth na sciencefiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild battlefield earth should be shown only at maximumsecurity prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior nscifi is always a tricky beast tight script a good director an ensemble cast of decent actors and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs nbattlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes nheres the plot nthe year is 3000 nmankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group na small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the demons who dwell in the cities below nthe psychlos are stripmining the earth for its resources and terel played by travolta is the head of security for the miningslave base located in denver na young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler played with dramatic flair by barry pepper ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the demons nhe is promptly captured and taken to the alien base nafter several attempts at escape johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terels involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end njonnie assumed leader of the mining slave group then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use nthen the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry the bill of rights how to use a machine gun and how to fly a harrier jet nthe whole mess concludes with a big loud obnoxious gunandplane battle that had me praying for the end credits nroger christian the director of this lumbering beast must have rented dune blade runner planet of the apes independence day stargate beastmaster the airwolf episodes the v miniseries the matrix and the omega man nand decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth nchristian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie nand every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe really nthe psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit ntravoltas acting hasnt been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect njonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like you can have your freedom if you fight nthen theres the script the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and take back the planet would be a difficult task to achieve nwhy nbecause terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt for no particular reason beside the fact that humans are stupid nterel may be right you know nhumans made this movie n
the plot of big mommas house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress nthats not just the highconcept premise its the fullyrealized allencompassing plot nsuch an emphasis is not unheardof in the world of hollywood summer entertainment none need merely look back to last summer when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent nthe trap inherent in such an approach is that the highconcept plot idea better be pretty wellrealized or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time not a developed character not a provocative theme not a witty twist nyou will get 90plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress nothing more nothing less nthose who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the onenote dud that is big mommas house nothers will simply stare mouth agape at its sheer unapologetic laziness nlawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john paul giamatti ndangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco terrence howard has escaped from prison and the feds think hes headed for his former girlfriend and presumedbutneverproved accomplice sherry nia long nsherry however has fled with her son trent jascha washington possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ella mitchell better known as big momma nindeed sherry appears to be on her way but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming nthat leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows nbig mommas houses bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs ndoubtfire director raja gosnell edited that film and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom but theres just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main characters attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman nunfortunately big mommas house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters nsuspension of disbelief in big mommas house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind andor stupid since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other nof course laughs trumps logic every time and big mommas house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny nand it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foultempered beast while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry nunfortunately no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another very different real person so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags malcolm reacting violently to big mommas explosive diarrhea attack malcolmasmomma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife one of the few sequences that works nmartin lawrence can be likeable enough at times but theres no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character nhes just big momma without the makeup on ni wont waste time commenting on how ineptly the setup of the escaped convict is employed since it was clearly a waste of time to the filmmakers nthere are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure but hes ultimately a distraction in a film thats really about its central visual incongruity and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia longs posterior nim never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing but i know that when a filmmaker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that its an entire film i duck out of the way nthe gross implausibility of big mommas house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big cleverlyconstructed laughs nits lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant nbig mommas house is ridiculous and not funny nits just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress n

isnt it the ultimate sign of a movies cinematic ineptitude when you cant think of much to say about it other than it sucks none of the first official year 2000 releases supernova is such a movie ni cant seem to get past oneword adjectives with this one although boring stupid and absurd doesnt amount to much of a review na shame ni would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate nbut cest la vie nhere goes nothing nill keep it short ni suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill 48 hours removed his name from the movie requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee nthe films fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press an event usually signifying a studios lack of confidence in a particular movie nhills and mgms actions were prudent nwhen the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer for some reason james spader is forced to take command nthe ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and on arrival picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony none of the crew members angela bassett knows this passenger who is played by peter facinelli and has some bad feelings about it and we all know what that means nthis intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it nanother one of the crew members experiences this first hand after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo he does some impressive handstand pushups nevidently touching this enigmatic eggshaped thingie makes you younger and stronger nhow nwhy nthe movie never bothers to explain nsoon enough though spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad being chased by the allofasuddensuperhuman facinelli nto be honest i dont even remember exactly why ni just remember that i didnt care nsupernovas plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing nin fact everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set nwell the effects are good though theres hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so im not sure whether thats so remarkable an accomplishment nthe performances are hardly worth talking about nim not even sure i can call whats here performances though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger njames spader is not a bad actor but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars ive seen in a while mostly because he isnt given a character with a personality nthe action scenes are just as bland since theyre pretty much just rehashes of action elements that werent particularly entertaining the first time around nand since the action scenes are everything to this movie its pretty much dead in the water nand for the life of me i cant figure out why its called supernova n
there have been merchantivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than the mod squad a selfconsciously hip cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many babyboomers nwell said squad certainly wont be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards na contemporary take on this decidedly 70s show doesnt exactly seem unwarranted but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didnt transform into a fullblown case of botulism nhow curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time nthey are julie pete and linc reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd exposition put out of the way so fast that youre likely to be lost from the opening moments on and they are respectively played by claire danes giovanni ribisi and omar epps talented actors each deserving of better than this ntheir plight involves standard copcorruption stuff as our wouldbe protagonists catch wind of an internal coverup after their superior reliable dennis farina one of the best things here and gone so quickly gets killed and framed for drug trafficking nthey pout a lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others nwhen youre supposed to be asking whats going to happen next nyoull instead entertain thoughts like who are these people and why should i care nor arent thrillers supposed to contain thrills nnot that danes epps and ribisi dont give it a shot ndanes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep as evidenced by my socalled life but shes saddled with a mysteriousboyfriend josh brolin subplot so seethrough you begin to seriously question her socalled intelligence nditto for ribisis saving private ryan looney loose cannon though at least he performs with a wildandcrazy vigor that occasionally demands attention nbut epps poor epps nepps higher learning is so shortchanged hes reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him nall this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters one of whom scott silver is also the director nthey must think that if they dress up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings the look of the film is really quite impressive itll somehow pay off but this mod squad plods anyway ncharacters are nonexistent present are just some goodlooking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes nplot hardly escapes confusing convention nand the one genre element youd think would be show up in generous portions a few nifty explosions some fights any kind of action whatsoever only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest nall those quick to put down last months inept but serviceable my favorite martian update need to take a step back nheres a smalltobigscreen translation that really shouldve stayed in its former incarnation mod or not n
if theres one thing i just cant stand its a film that oozes with sentimentality nheres a note to all film makers films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves nswelling saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy and that the situation is hopeless nalas my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up nwhat reminded me was that i wasnt choked up or even the slightest bit moved for that matter nmy giant is a forced contrived and conspicuously uncute i detest the word cute but ive chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a cute film here nit takes a premise that might have been interesting i liked the preview and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience nmaybe it will work for some people nit didnt work for me nbilly crystal plays sam cayman an agent who at the beginning of the film is in romania nhes in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film nthe screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired get in a car accident and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall nhis name is max gheorghe muresan and sam thinks hed be a great movie star because of his size nsubplots are as follows sam has a son and a wife kathleen quinlan and hes never around for them so they move to chicago nmax is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins nsam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money and so their various subplots can all be resolved nsam is broke nmax is dying npass the kleenex nmy giant as a comedy is only moderately funny nit has its moments the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself nin one great scene sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal of course his son doesnt believe that hes actually speaking to seagal and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ncrystal is always entertaining and he has a few good lines here some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely often however hes countered by a slew of jokes that arent funny and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes nmuresan is kind of fun to watch but he just cant act very well nquinlan on the other hand is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents nshe was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff nhere the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent nall of these disappointing ingredients create a film that for much of its running time is simply mediocre nas my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion however director michael lehmann who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings nsams multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family nlater it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sams reunion with his family nand some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing but i had a few morality problems with it and i apologize for being vague nits icky nit drips with gooey wannabe human emotions nmy giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film nmore importantly it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is ninstead its a complicated overlong and underengaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears nand since it left me feeling completely unmoved i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world n

i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick ntake the professional for example nit boasts extremely glossy cinematography a couple of recognizable name actors and a couple of fairly impressive explosions nits also basically about violence and cheap titilation and features a central relationship between a middleaged man and a twelveyearold girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension nthe professional is all over the map and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant nthe professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon jean reno brutally efficient but also very isolated none day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door nher name is matilda natalie portman and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d e a nagent norman stansfield gary oldman after matildas father tried to rip him off nleon reluctantly takes matilda in then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother nthe two become closer which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much and sets out to eliminate them both nwriterdirector luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita a slick potboiler about a female assassin nthere is no question that besson can make a great looking film with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast he has created a film chock full of moody closeups and evocative lighting nbut beneath the shiny wrapper there isnt nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe nthe relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop nleon is mostly a collection of quirky traits all intended to show us that for a hired killer hes really not so bad a guy he drinks lots of milk takes meticulous care of a potted plant and enjoys gene kelly movies njean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda nnatalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality but she doesnt have too much to work with either nbesson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing na silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag ngary oldmans entire part is something of a cheap gag wildeyed and way over the top but at least he is interesting to watch nthere isnt a real person to be found anywhere in the professional which isnt always a problem in an action thriller except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more na more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelveyearold in a really distasteful way nthere were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matildas relationship confront it head on or ignore it entirely nbut besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that hes going to show them a forbidden love story while choosing simply to focus his camera on portmans rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing nthis is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol or the blood which is spilled aplenty na great deal of the time the professional is just plain sleazy and all the soft filters in the world cant disguise that fact n

weighed down by tired plot lines and spielbergs reliance on formulas saving private ryan is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches nthere ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics nspielbergs greatest strength as a director is the polished formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story nbut for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war or the holocaust this technique backfires for it creates coherent comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken nin this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films nsaving private ryan tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a pr mission to pull a young man ryan whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere out of combat on the normandy front just after dday nryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers nthe search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france ntheres no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie nthe equipment uniforms and weapons are superbly done nthe opening sequence in which captain miller tom hanks leads his men onto omaha beach is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat nanother pleasing aspect of the film is spielbergs brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers the banality of death in combat the routine foulups in the execution of the war and the cynicism of the troops nthe technical side of the film is peerless as always nthe camera work is magnificent the pacing perfect the sets convincing the directing without flaw nhanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance which was utterly convincing and the supporting cast was excellent though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel nyet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events nit has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film or the story fails to convince nthroughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices exception men are shown burning to death with relative frequency nfor example we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground nhere and there men lose limbs in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety theres an explosion and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man nbut the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact nthere are no shoes with only feet in them no limbs scattered everywhere no torsos without limbs no charred corpses and most importantly all corpses have heads in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds nthe relentless dehumanization of the war in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity is softpedaled in the film nultimately saving private ryan bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war nrather than saying saving private ryan is realistic it would be better to describe it as having realistic moments nanother aspect of the hollywoodization of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular the lack of swearing nanyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war such as fussells superb wartime understanding and behavior in the second world war which has an extensive discussion on swearing knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup n who is this private ryan that we have to die for him nasks one infantrymen in the group of eight nrendered in wartime demotic that should have been expressed as who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him nor some variant thereof nconversations should have been literally sprinkled with the f word and largely about the search for food and sex nthis is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an r rating due to violence so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film nhowever the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic nthe most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg nhe cannot just cede control to the material he has to be bigger than it nas if afraid to let the viewer find their own perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear emotional foothold in the material spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary reminscent of the closing scene from schindlers list the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close every bit as bad as schindlers monologue about how his car tiepin or ring could have saved another jew quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson captain millers last words to private ryan and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain nthat particular subplot is so hokey so predictable it nigh on ruins the film nnowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage nbecause of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii saving private ryan can only pan for small truths in the shallows n n
the blues brothers was a wonderful film a hilarious comedy packed with good music nit cried out for a sequel but john belushis untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea nhowever eighteen years have passed and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged nunfortunately its a sequel not worthy of the original nthe film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended nelwood blues dan aykroyd is just getting out of jail his brother jake having recently died nas in the first film he first visits mother mary stigmata kathleen freeman and then sets about getting the band back together njohn belushis absence leaves a terrible hole in the film and although three new characters are created to fill the void it is still very noticeable nfirst theres cabel joe morton the illegitimate son of elwoods stepfather played by cab calloway in the first movie ncabel is reluctant to join his destiny and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff chasing the blues brothers band nnext theres mighty mack john goodman a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band nfinally theres buster j nevan bonifant a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band nthe plotting of the film is hardly original it nseems to be almost a clone of the original nelwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band they then travel while being pursued by the police and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale nthe first film had neonazis as the random element this time around the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role nin fact the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original nremember the classic performance at country bobs where they like both types of music country and western from the first movie nwell this movie has a performance at a country fair where the band is expected to play bluegrass music ntheres the massive police car pileup although this time the gag falls completely flat ntheres even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus james brown nthere are plenty of recurring characters too nin addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs murphy nfrank oz a prison guard in the first film makes an appearance here as the prison warden nas the stars the new blues brothers dont live up to their legacy naykroyd is more loquacious yet much flatter as elwood njohn goodman barely has a character as mighty mack njoe morton has the deepest character but not a terribly interesting one as cab nand whats the deal with the orphan nit plays like a desperate gimmick that doesnt mesh at all with the rest of the film nat least bonifant isnt as precocious as he could have been in the role nbut the true star and the only saving grace of the film is the music nand the film is packed with it even during and after the ending credits nalthough there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the originals rawhidestand by your man medley the music is very much enjoyable nto top it off the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances nb b king blues traveler eric clapton travis tritt wilson pickett erykah badu bo diddley and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there nunfortunately the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot nif simply copying the original blues brothers wasnt bad enough writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down removing any memorable characters and replacing them with flashy but unbelievable magical gimmicks nits a shame nbuy the soundtrack and avoid the film nbetter yet rewatch the original youll nhave a much better time n

i cant recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota nfor forty minutes or so i was lured into a loopy if occasionally overwrought romantic comedy and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt nthen rather suddenly i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence shortly thereafter i was whacked in the gut by another nfeeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated as though i had trusted writerdirector steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face nfeeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie cameron diaz who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red delroy lindo suspects her of stealing from him nreds punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper sam clayton vincent donofrio who is far from the man of freddies dreams nenter jjaks keanu reeves sams estranged younger brother who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddies eye and have sex with her in the bathroom nunited in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam jjaks and freddie take off together but sam isnt ready to let them go without a fight nfreddie meanwhile isnt ready to let sams money go without a fight and thus begins a series of violent confrontations nthere is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sams intense sibling rivalry as boys and their mother tuesday weld sending jjaks away to live with his father nit does a great job of setting up jjaks unstable life a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family reeves wounded look is just right for jjaks nthe wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin nmost important baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements i will dare on the car radio nyou would have every reason to expect that relationships both familial and romantic would be the focal point of feeling minnesota nunfortunately you would be dead wrong ni suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding but i certainly didnt expect what i got nwhat i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality or rather creating gags about brutality nsuddenly the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable nthe sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another but there is no consistency to the characterizations nvincent donofrio turns in a manic performance as sam whose jealousy competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood nthere are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully jonathan demmes something wild and neil jordans the crying game come to mind but they didnt try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment ni dont want to dismiss baigelmans successes out of hand he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop and some wellcrafted comic moments and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a lighthearted caper nit is his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value and that he cant make his two halves into a whole nfeeling minnesota left me feeling used and theres not much funny about that n
the people who populate the movie 54 are shallow selfabsorbed and selfindulgent nin other words they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts n54 is the story of that wellpublicized new york disco studio 54 the inplace in the 70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled photographed and pampered nthe difficulty with 54 which was written and directed by mark christopher is that his script takes no point of view nchristopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio 54s hallmark nhe keeps an uninvolved distance thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists nthe movies one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell the famous owner of the nightspot nhe is part rebel part dreamer part shrewd entrepreneur nhes smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs nmyers in his first straight character part is in turn appealing and appalling nat one moment he can try to pressure a male employee into a sexual situation then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man a handful of cash nthe story is told by shane oshea ryan phillippe a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple nshades of john travoltas brooklynbound tony in saturday night fever neventually shane does come to new york attracts rubells eye and is admitted to the promised land nhis looks get him a job as a busboy and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous nshanes dream is to meet soap star julie black neve campbell a fellow garden stater nbut both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up its no big deal nthe chemistry between shane and julie is nonexistent n54 is a very cold uninvolving movie nits all strobe lights and glitz all substance nits sort of like the musical era it covers n
inspired by the 1958 film house on haunted hill starring vincent price ndirected by william malone nstarring geoffrey rush famke janssen and chris kattan nrated r contains violence profanity and brief nudity nsynopsis eccentric millionaire price offers 1 000 000 to each of his guests who appear at a gathering at a former sanitarium nthe only catch is that they have to survive the night at the establishment an establishment haunted by its former staff and patients ncomments house on haunted hill is based upon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price nin an obvious homage the millionaires name is price and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have nthis is a pretty bad horror film yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining and house on haunted hill is just such a film nit is surprisingly better than another recent haunted house remake the haunting a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson nthe haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face nhouse on haunted hill owes its lineage to a bmovie 40 years old and makes no illusion that its a crappy horror movie nthus somehow it proves slightly more successful ni cant think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast nit is this cast which lifts this hohum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror nprice the main character is played by geoffrey rush the academyaward winning actor of shine nrush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie industry a spiral reminiscent of ben ghandi schindlers list kingsleys ridiculous appearance in the camp scifi classic species ni dont know why but sometimes its entertaining to see quality actors in bad movies nmore surprises nrising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure rather lamely too and singer lisa loeb nappears as a tv news reporter nthe highlight of the cast however has to be saturday night live member chris kattan nkattans comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium nwhile the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to whats exactly going on the second half dissolves into standard ghost story stuff and loses some of its suspense na disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movie too nhouse on haunted hill i suspect has just about left the secondrun theaters nits worth catching on cable next year if you get a chance nif you have a choice pick this movie over the haunting its the better of two evils you could say nthough more appropriately perhaps itd be better to say that its the better of two turkeys n
the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes nalas it refers to our heroes nas it turns out the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth via the mir space station thinks of the human race as a virus perhaps even a cancer that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further nafter all we have taken up this entire planet and if they let us live for another billion years or so we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one nbut the human race doesnt have much to worry about nafter all theres a woman named foster jamie lee curtis out there stopping the computer virus nshes the chief navigator on a sea vessel travelling with her is captain everton donald sutherland steve baker william baldwin woods marshall bell squeaky julio oscar mechoso and richie sherman augustus ntheyre all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters nlucky for us we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board nthe evil captain everton thinks hes going to take the ship in and get a reward he convinces his crew that theres going to be big money so they try to salvage the ship nsoon however when its apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power they realize that something bad must have happened nfinally they meet nadia joanna pacula who explains their situation a computer virus has taken over the ship nits creating biomechanical lifeforms to eliminate the human race nvirus is a truly dumb action thriller one of negligible intelligence and innovation nwhen considering the entire film you will realize that it lacks a single original scene nits a direct ripoff of nearly every james cameron film aliens the abyss and the terminator films are the most plagiarized more importantly its basically the same movie as last years deep rising ni liked deep rising simply because its funny it knows its silly and derivative nvirus takes itself seriously nand in the most serious manner possible it steals from every good and bad film of the genre showing you countless familiar scenes and sporting a cookiecutter plot that any film of the scifihorror genre could fit with a little trimming nbut what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out nokay let me get this straight the alien race which is never really explained is basically sentient electricity nthey need to make themselves physical so they use a space station to get onto a ship which is surrounded by water but who cares about that non the ship they make a bunch of clunky immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people nafter that they start using the dead people to create halfhuman halfmachine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around nthe leader of course is a big creature nevery film like this has a big creature at the end but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around nvirus is indeed a cliched film but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isnt very threatening nits established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there non one level virus is almost passable fun nits really gory and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal the director john bruno worked on a lot of camerons films ntheres also a nice array of actors even though none of them do any acting except for donald sutherland who does a lot of very bad acting nthe bottom line however is this virus is a bad movie nit rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing nin that order i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes n
you know that a movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing and nits not a comedy nand what a strange career path for director chuck russell nhe starts his career off with a decent take on the nightmare on elm street series with his debut as director on installment number three nhe follows that up with the blob the very next year but waits another six years to do his next piece a little film called the mask starring jim carrey and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that nso then he thought let me wait another five years get a weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes nstrange dude and one crappy flick nplot a sixyear old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god na satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side while the girls aunt wants to well nsave her from those damn devil worshippers nenter one occult expert agent plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying and youve just about got the gist of things here ncritique with plot holes the size of my ass this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich ridden plot with wasted talent cheezy effects bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot nwhats good about this movie nwell rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway childrens sheltersatanist supreme with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around nthe little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesnt really do all that much nand believe it or not i was actually enjoying some of the films first half hour which starts off with some promise but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist basinger just drown the films entire basis of believability nfor some reason it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes is na dumb one nadd that to the entire police force of incompetents save for jimmy smits whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move nat least change the clothes jimmy zero scares zero thrills and even less actual drama and youve got yourself a pretty bad movie nand why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie ndid they owe the director a favor or something ntogether they barely have five minutes of screen time but i suppose that riccis hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horndogs nthe worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of sneaking up on a mans house who they know to be guilty of a crime nuuuhmm hows nabout knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass officers nanyway i dont usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof and there was plenty to go around nand did basinger lose some of her acting talent during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win ndifficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad or if she just delivered them poorly neither way little originality very obvious computer effects little thrills little drama and very little entertainment value certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film nbut if you really dont mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and kid based thrillers and enjoy watching films that dont bring anything new to the table well ndrink some beers smoke some beans and rent this video because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year n
its always a bad sign when the core audience of a film children are either walking out early or are halfasleep when the credits roll at the end of a film nthat about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians a cold pea soup of cute animals stupid home alone antics a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression nindeed walt disney is rolling over in his grave again cursing john hughes name for making the original liveaction 101 dalmatians one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time and now its sequel nthe main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor 101 dalmatians nthe original made more than 100 million dollars at the box office spawned a torrid collection of collectible items that ended up months later in the discount bins of walmarts across the country and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas nwell its been about four years since then and dalmatian fever is coming back and this time its digitally enhanced nheres the story ncruella de vil glenn close is released from prison due to the cure of her puppy homicide urges by one dr pavlov n oh how witty nshe rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film ncruella then becomes ella dog lover until the plot twists like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck and she becomes the evil vixen again na kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula nat this point i was envying those kids filing out of the theater nhow low have glenn close and gerard depardieu as the films villain sunk in the film business nits almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon nand depardieu nhow can a french guy have a bad french accent nand never mind the toilet brush haircut nthe only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent courtesy of eric idle that thinks hes a rottweiler nnow thats funny n
2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off nit basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways nim not going into much greater detail than that since it would take forever to explain and quite frankly im not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that ive already wasted nwhile it tries very hard to be pulp fiction 2 days in the valley falls way short nthis is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello james spader and jeff daniels nwhile the story isnt much and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better 2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots njames spaders character while not much better than the rest is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way nand we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron in her first role nyou know a movie isnt that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women neven if they are both gorgeous ni will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted nbut marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result nwhile some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about nif i were to put a number on it only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch nthis is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent and even then prepare for disappointment nnot even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again nor at least not all of it anyway n
by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer its possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one naction lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup naudience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the films sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending which is an insulting copout nsomewhere out there maybe theres a small cadre of filmgoers who will appreciate spheres dubious charms but im not among them ni sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by its hard to understand why the rights were optioned nsphere is the kind of first class mess that only a topline director with an alist cast can create nwith expectations high and how could they not be considering that another barry levinsondustin hoffman collaboration the excellent wag the dog is still playing in theaters nsomething this bad cant help but look even worse nthe last time a bigname bigbudget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last years batman robin and everyone knows how that movie was received nsphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james camerons the abyss but somewhere along the way it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort event horizon nscience and philosophy which are used to good effect during spheres first hour give way to mindless confusing action sequences nattempts at characterization fall apart nintelligent writing which is evident early on is replaced by hackneyed drivel nspecial effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness nbut all that is just in preparation for the ending which is inexcusably awful nthis is the timehonored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect ni left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film nthere is some promise but its all in the setup nwere introduced to norman goodman dustin hoffman a psychologist who once wrote a 35 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered nwhen one is found in the middle of nowhere 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee non the team with him are beth halperin sharon stone a biochemist who was once his student and lover harry adams samuel l jackson a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ted fielding liev schreiber an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology and harold barnes peter coyote the government operative in charge of the mission ntogether the five descend into the bowels of the ocean where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact nfor a while sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the manmeetsalien situation nthe overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship apparently from the future offer intriguing possibilities nthen right around the onehour mark thats the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatevers left of titanic the virtually nonstop action begins and once it starts the script becomes superfluous nthis might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension but instead he relies on loud overbearing music strange camera angles and quick cuts to make things exciting nadditionally because none of the characters are wellformed a common failing in anything penned by crichton whos more interested in technology than people viewers dont develop much of a rooting interest nit makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience nwhat about that alist cast nnot surprisingly the most energetic performance is given by samuel l jackson but his harry isnt a person hes a walking plot device spouting occasionallywitty dialogue ndustin hoffman isnt lively or particularly good its ironic that this which may be his worst work in a decade has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination for wag the dog nsharon stone and peter coyote are both flat ntheir characters exhibit little evidence of emotion automatons would have been as effective nthen theres queen latifa who despite getting fifth billing in the credits ahead of liev schreiber who boasts at least quadruple her screen time has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count ni like to think that levinson and hoffman recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance the lowbudget picture was filmed during spheres lengthy preproduction phase nif thats the case forgiveness is granted nim less inclined to look favorably upon crichton although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume jurassic park and the levinsondirected disclosure come to mind neven if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process crichtons credit as a producer disallows him absolution nhe was a willing participant in a creative travesty nno wonder sphere is being released in february in the midst of the early years cinematic wasteland nit deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninthconsecutive weekend atop the box office heap n
the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits nthe rationale is sound but in many cases of this and recent years the sequel is a shoddy product thats exposed for the cashmilking vehicle it really is nlast years speed 2 and scream 2 as well as this years species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory nin some cases a sequel can even discredit its predecessor as with the latest neoslasher flick i still know what you did last summer nwhatever uniqueness the original mightve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller njulie james jennifer love hewitt and ray bronson freddie prinze jr are back from the original to star in i still know reprising their roles in typical fashion njulie and ray experience a rather predictable fallingout at the beginning of the movie leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson matthew settle nwill and julie hit it off and along with friends karla brandy norwood and tyrell mekhi phifer the foursome heads off to a radio stationgiveaway vacation in the tropics nunfortunately things arent so peachy once they arrive and with a regularity you could set your watch by the infamous fisherman muse watson is back with his hook nits another bloody showdown complete with cliffhanger ending ntheres not much thats original about i still know and with the market saturated by genx thrillers like this one its unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel nfor diehard fans of the genre this will be required viewing material but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer nthe aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isnt heightened by skillful scripting or camera work but rather a tense stringbased score and manipulative editing nthe man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments nmuch of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point nthe whole reason the plot exists julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station is a dead giveaway lessening suspense and creating a hurryupandwait timing problem nand whereas the killers identity mightve been a question in the first movie its almost a given here which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically nthree or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as the killer ntheyre almost used to it and the performances show it not hewitt nor prinze nor brandy nor phifer give a decent show nand so in the end its left wide open for a third movie and most likely a brand new supporting cast ngod help us n

its actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i the phantom menace because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy nand no i really dont feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the boxoffice nreally i dont nnot at all nthe plot has been done before a mysterious unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town causing confusion for everyone who reads it nthe center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen kate capshaw and by the way what is it with bookstore owner main characters nin the past year and a half weve seen them in life is beautiful youve got mail this movie and the upcoming notting hill who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore nshe immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from and comes to the incorrect conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott nhe reading the letter himself assumes that she wrote it for him nafter a while they fall in love well duh nkate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman tom selleck nto add to her turmoil her mother shows up blythe danner who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9 and her trusted bookstore manager deadpan ellen degeneres quits nsupporting characters arent called supporting for nothing ntheir purpose isnt just to move the plot along theyre also supposed to give the storyline a backbone nto do this they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting nrarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed dull cardboard secondary characters especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonists various interactions with them nthis is the love letters damning error ncapshaws character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely onedimensional nbecause of that the love letter is awkward and insincere neven worse its a bore ni liked capshaw and her helen but everyone else is painfully fake undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist nthere is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either and besides degeneres wisecracks theres little that is even a little amusing nthis is not a completely thoughtless film and director peter hosun chan does a good job of portraying helens yearnings and various subtle complexities nbut its far from profound nthere isnt a common theme running through the proceedings thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless nreally this is a harmless little movie its far from an abomination and its not torturous to sit through nbut bad it is nawful it also is nthe love letter is a failure and an inane failure at that n 1999 eugene novikov n
an affluent horse breeders past comes up to haunt him an ages old coverup and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices nthats pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow nthat aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source nthe acting in particular i found very good the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie na few things about the story didnt sit very well with me for example the original scam and coverup heavily involved the character played by sharon stone yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better non the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot nthe characters aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing nas far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener nall these people acted their parts admirably as for the part that sharon stone played she played it well but the part was not utilized enough nthe directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie this is one of those occasions nmatthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject i myself wouldnt be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it nthere is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this nthe one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing the subject matter in my opinion wasnt interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it ni certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself dont like it nall in all i found this movie boring and very slow the acting was good but the story just didnt evolve enough and wasnt captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch nalthough there is much going for the movie i didnt find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them ni wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie n
bats is this years camp flick nwith the worlds worst dialogue cheesiest premise and stupidest editor this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity nas for the rest of us well nid say skip it but looking at the box office figures for this one it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway nfollow their lead and youll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot ni love alfred hitchcocks the birds almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based nit saddens me even more then to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horrorschlock such as bats nwhen mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town the authorities call in a batologist dina meyer to investigate nit turns out that a creepy scientist bob gunton has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab making them smarter and more vicious nwhy has he done this you ask nbecause you see it is apparently a scientists job to make things a little better even if that means the death of all mankind nso the batologist her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff lou diamond phillips have to kill all the bats and save the world nof course that cant happen before they wallow in some guamo bat shit for the uninitiated get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture nconsider for example a scene where two people are in a bat cave nthe bats are all sleeping but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out nwhat do they do ndo they get the hell out of there as fast as they can nnope nthey stand there for a while transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes nwhat keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes nwe dont even get to see whats going on the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick nall we know is that bats are attacking nhow they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery na little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies and bats sure could use some nof course director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor but it is so conventional it doesnt really go anywhere nmost of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologists wisecracking sidekick leon who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like i hate bats nsome of these are so bad that they take on a double quality they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept ni hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame oneliners nplaying such characters does not help actors careers nstill i suppose that if youre looking for a movie that is so bad its good you could do worse than bats nit does have a tremendous amount of camp value nim not recommending the movie because quite frankly it sucks and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it nmore power to them n

ah and 1999 was going along so well too n shes all that has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie ive seen so far this year nand quite frankly i doubt ill see anything equally bad n at least i hope i dont see anything equally bad n shes all that tells the story of the most popular guy in school played by freddie prinze jr who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school rachel leigh cook into the most popular nthat right there is problem 1 nhow many times have we seen this storyline nas cook comments near the end of the film its kind of like pretty woman except without the prostitution nof course had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material the wellworn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward nas it is though shes all that relies completely on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead ntheres not one original or interesting character in the film either and if that wasnt bad enough theres not one good performance featured nthe star of the movie rachel leigh cook is simply horrible ni usually dont like to get so personal but in this case i think it needs to be said ncook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was ni was never convinced that she was a nerd and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary nthe movie seems to be saying its better to be popular than to be who you are nas for freddie prinze jr an actor i ordinarily enjoy he too is quite bad here nhe coasts through the film on socalled charm and never establishes a real character nkieren culkin is here too as the brother of cook nand for some indiscernable reason hes got hearing aids nno explanation is given and theyre never brought up nwere we supposed to feel sorry for him just because he wore hearing aids ni dont think so nthat single element of the film was one of the most offensive things ive seen in a movie in a long time n shes all that sucks nthats what it boils down to nits not entertaining and its not even a good time passer nthe hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hairremoval system informercial nand whats worse it sends out a bad message to teens nit appears to be telling them hey it doesnt matter if youre happy the way you are nthats unimportant nif you want to truly be happy dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubbleheaded moron nugh n
in the mid1980s following the splendid debut in hugh hudsons greystoke and relative success of first highlander film it looked like christopher lamberts acting career might go somewhere nbut it wasnt meant to be which became obvious following highlander ii nin this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality nvery often such films were science fiction which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert nwhether it was because of real lack of talent terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isnt important the end result was almost always horrible nthe same can be said for fortress 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond nthe movie is set in 2018 nfor some undisclosed reason usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child njake christopher lambert and karen brennick lori laughlin broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border nsentenced to 31 years in prison they are both thrown into fortress privately owned correctional facility equiped with stateoftheart futuristic technology and run by computer called zed nalthough equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates lives and make any escape impossible prison authorities often use violence njake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape nsuch escape should become necessity because the warden poe kurtwood smith begins showing unhealthy interest in karen nafter rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity nthe reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich s and situations that are painfully predictable nby the time brennick begins his escape from fortress those situations not only begin to look predictable but utterly implausible too nof course film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultraexpensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society nthe initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters played by not too interested or talented actors nlori laughlin although physically attractive shows the acting ability of sequoia nkurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired capable of solid yet forgettable performance nlamberts performance is also good but even the bigger talent couldnt help this film destined to end in oblivion n

several days after having seen this movie im still trying to determine what director christopher guest a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes nthis is a dreadful motion picture a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughstojokes ratio ntheres a kind of desperation in the movies approach to humor that reveals the film makers uncertainty about how entertaining the material is the manic style betrays itself as a lastditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script nthe premise doesnt sound especially amusing to begin with almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers the effeminate leslie edwards matthew perry and the uncouth bartholomew hunt chris farley who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest nedwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies albeit of the early19th century variety including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages none of which prove to be useful a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries nalong the way the intrepid explorers encounter bears bald eagles aging native american warriors and a conquistador named hildago kevin dunn who raves about his beautiful hair nthe explorers trek takes them through forests across the snowcapped rocky mountains and over a waterfall nthis setup leads to a lot of shouting a great deal of lunacy and very few laughs nfarley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing but aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle his heart doesnt seem to be in it nmatthew perry one of the stars of tvs friends who had some modest success in the romantic comedy fools rush in is badly miscast nas a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man nim not a big fan of david spade and i didnt like tommy boy but at least he and farley worked well together nas far as the supporting players go none of them makes more than a fleeting impression neugene levy is wasted and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla nfrankly its a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap the big picture and waiting for guffman nalthough guest gets the costumes right this nearlyinconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution nthe special effects such as they are are execrable nfor an example of some really poor blue screen work look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids theyre obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them and where farley is being carried off by an eagle neven though farley didnt have the most stellar of acting careers he doesnt deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes nwhile some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12year old boys the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric nfarley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session n

whenever u s government starts meddling into other countries affairs under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political religious or ethnic persecution the other side is ready to use mantra that says look whos talking nwhat have you done to the indians nhowever even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes nhollywood is just another example with its revisionist westerns made in early 1990s nthose movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus discovery of america none of such examples is geronimo an american legend 1993 western directed by walter hill film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers nthe hero of the film is geronimo played by wes studi leader of apaches fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century nwhen the movie begins in 1885 geronimo and his apaches made peace with u s government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation nhowever broken promises injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless nwith not more 30 or so of his followers he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign ngeneral crook gene hackman commander of u s army forces respects geronimo and knows that even his 5 000 force isnt enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest ninstead he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches lt charles gatewood jason patric and indian hunter al sieber robert duvall ntogether with young lt britton davis matt damon they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo ngeronimo an american legend like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors nso the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies nalmost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people nalthough such elements of john millius screenplay do indeed have some basis in history they harm the story of geronimo nto be honest walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time ninstead they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band nto make even worse hill has some real problems with pacing and style and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one story about geronimo and story about his pursuers nthe movie should have been better if it turned to geronimos life before and after his last uprising in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood nthe difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting nwes studi cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans was perfect choice for geronimo not only because he resembles geronimo but because he induces a lot of passion in his role ncontrary to him we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies nwhile this could be expected from someone like jason patric it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall neven hills directing is bellow expectations battle scenes are too short and like in many of his late films force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s neven his old associate music composer ry cooder disappoints with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic non the other hand photography by lloyd ahern ii with the use of red lenses gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic nall in all compared with some of the hollywoods examples of political correctness this film isnt so bad but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better n
alexander dumas the three musketeers is one of the most oftenadapted literary works and for good reason the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story nperhaps the musketeer a new film that reimagines the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix is one adaptation too many nits just awful spiritless silly and unforgivably boring transforming the timeless classic into a mishmash of oldastime clich s and incoherent repetitive action sequences nthis time dartagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers who cant even pronounce his characters name nas a boy he watched his father get killed by febre tim roth a lackey of powerhungry cardinal richelieu nhe vowed to have vengeance nafter undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman he goes looking for his enemy non his quest he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government nthe royal musketeers have lost their gusto what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinals own guards nonly a few loyal swashbuckers remain among them athos and portos who are only figureheads in this movie ntogether with dartagnan they fight to extricate the queen catherine deneuve from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant noh and as an afterthought dartagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn mena suvari njust thought id mention that nnow look i dont know whose idea this was but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tonguelashing ni have nothing against modernizing classic works of literature at the very least they can inspire viewers to actually read the book but films as dull as this have no positive side effects ndirector peter hyams known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas masterwork the sense of excitement cause and camaraderie ninstead we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing nwhen the musketeers finally get to holler all for one and one for all i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt nmaybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyamss tone which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the readers digest condensed version of the story that he gives us nits as though anything that may have been construed as fun was purposely expunged from the production nthe joylessness of the proceedings from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes can be felt in every frame nchambers cant act suvari roth and deneuve can but arent given the chance nand when push comes to shove the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit nsome movies seem sloppy and careless clearly made for a quick buck nwith the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful nthe film is intricate stylish and precise hitting the wrong note every single time n
staring george clooney arnold schwarzenegger chris odonnell and uma thurman with alicia silverstone nwell to start this off id just like to say a couple things nfirst is i miss michael keaton i miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like a dallas dream sequence nnot even from the first film was batman really the star though he was damn close in the first couple anyway nin batman forever and now in batman robin hes almost pushed to being a bit player ni cant really say if clooney who regardless was better than kilmer was a very good batman or not nhes given next to nothing to do at all he might as well not have been there and it wouldnt have made much difference nnow joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wont make batman brooding and dark nfine i mean granted batman returns while being an awsome film was a bit to dark sometimes nyet his bright neon campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me nim usually very easy on films ni loved con air and other films some critics have slammed ngranted that film really was paper thin cliche ridden except for one thing it was fun nthere is virtually no fun in this film at all ni couldnt have cared less nitll thrill the little ones as theres no violence really none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing nschwarzenegger is awful i mean really really bad nand this is coming from a regular fan of his work ni love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them nhe talks all to often in this movie ni would have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll ni believe to truely like a film you have to care about at least someone in a film ni liked alfred but the reason behind it is a cheap shot n
midway through anaconda documentary filmmaker terri flores jennifer lopez turns to a coworker and says i thought this movie would be my first big break ninstead its turned into a disaster ntruer words have never been spoken n anaconda is a monster movie with a lousy monster nits a suspense film that is utterly predictable nits a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares but only in the most elementary way like a jackinthebox nas you turn the crank youre totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up but somehow its still mildly startling when it happens nthe main difference between the giant snake in anaconda and the clown in a jackinthebox is that the clown is more realistic n anaconda boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years nanimatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe inducing robots youve endured at disney world nbut its the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame nin one shot a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air nthe scene if done well would have been a jaw dropper nhere the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon nwhats really amazing is that the filmmakers were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie nbut enough about the phony snakes nnow its time to talk about the lousy story nheroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest nstoltz tells his crew pray that you didnt forget your bug spray napparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect nalong the way the group rescues a whackedout lapsed priest jon voight who claims to know how to find the shirishama nwithin minutes they throw away all their plans and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness nfrom that point on the film is a hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from jaws and dead calm none of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz nearly in the story his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious nso why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance nalso why did stoltz who generally selects his roles with great care agree to appear in this crap nah the mysteries of hollywood nthe remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen njonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters nlopez who starred in selena is an enormously appealing performer possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible nice cube has a special charisma an ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously ntheres also a special twinkle in his eyes as if hes gently mocking his own toughguy posturing nbut the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight nobsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas voight plays the villain in thick accent with a series of leers and hisses spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of jonny quest nat one point he looms over the crew and says the anaconda is the perfect killing machine nit strikes wraps around you holds you tighter than your true love nand you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode n that moment is so highcamp that it almost made the film tolerable nalmost nfans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out anaconda ndont nthere are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer including another alien sequel nwait for them rent jaws in the meantime and dont throw away your money and time on drivel like this n
you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year ntheyre obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big boxoffice holiday season ncombine that with howie longs first starring action role and youve got a doozy of a movie that while not as bad as it could have been isnt a very good film nhowie stars as an ace smokejumper a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground nin the slightly contrived opening scenes we witness his heroism in action as he and his mentor played by scott glenn attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire nwilliam forsythe plays the bad guy a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak nhe and five convict cohorts manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby nhis escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards but since there must be a movie luck is with him nsoon the nowescaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters nwhy canadian nwho knows eh nalong the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher suzy amis to be their hostage nenter howie long nhes called in to help fight the blaze and when he spots the group of ground pounders apparently lost he parachutes in to help nwhen he discovers their true identity he is the only thing standing between them and escape and the only hope of help for the hostage nlongs acting talents are above those of say steven seagal but not by much nalthough his delivery is mostly flat and wooden hes a likeable hero and there are some hints here and there that he may get better nthe script doesnt help him out any however nall too often it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny nthe dialogue is strictly bmovie material and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable nlongs costars are a mixed bag nat least theyre all comfortable in their respective roles nforsythe has the scenerychewing villain down cold down cold and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch even when he doesnt seem to be stretching his talents as is definitely the case here nsuzy amis plays peril pretty well but isnt given much more to do nsome of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting but many are rather bland nyoud think that the director dean semler a former cinematographer would at least produce a film with interesting visuals nthats not the case ntheres a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences weve nseen this stuff before nits not the most auspicious start to 1998 but it could have been worse just think back to 1996s debut biodome nhowever after a month of oscarcaliber pictures a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were nin fact theres a good chance that some of them are still playing near you n
capsule dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes and now something of a landmark for having spawned a jillion clones nbasic instincts worst crime is that its not just a bad movie but in many ways an incompetent one as well nits stupid in itself and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is nits supposed to be a thriller but the plot is dead on its feet and ultimately arbitrary its only put into the movie to jerk us around nits also supposed to be sexy but its instead got the unpleasant rawness of a teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures nits a ripoff nthe story opens with a rock star being murdered while in the throes of orgasm nthe biggest suspect is an authoress catherine tramell sharon stone who wrote a novel in which the murder was eerily presaged nor maybe its the work of a copycat nthese and other plot threads get fed to the detective whos on the case michael douglas who has a few problems himself nlike we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor nwe can measure with a stopwatch the time from them setting eyes on each other to the moment they are doing the mattress dance njoe eszterhas has written the screenplay and he uses a device that he used before in the much better jagged edge the killers identity is kept a secret until the movies final shot nthis isnt in itself a problem the problem is that up until that point weve been given nothing to work with nevery clue in the movie every clue is ambiguous nthe whole thriller aspect of the movie is a shill nred herrings dead plot threads violence and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets nthey add up to zip because theyre not happening to people we care about ndouglass character is foulmouthed and bitter and thats it stones character has an ironon smile that never changes the rest are forgettable nwhen we dont even have the luxury of giving a damn about anyone in the movie who cares what happens in it nespecially with an ending that is not only unsatisfying but in many ways inexplicable n a friend of mine once came up with a rule of thumb about movie characters if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know or would care to know just leave none of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someones life but as a kind of kink something to thrill men with ni despair whenever i encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in a bigbudget hollywood film is as a hefnerism n
its not a bad thing to update old stories nits done all the time in the oral tradition nthe difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed its that its dry nthe new cinderella danielle drew barrymore is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come nshes a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france nwhen her father dies she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla anjelica huston nshe works by day but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night nalthough the story is updated you know the plot ndanielle meets prince henry dougray scott goes to a ball disguised is later found out and they live happily ever after nthe movie is often like watching a filmed play ntheater in real life is engrossing ntheater on the screen is usually lifeless nthere doesnt seem to be much going on nthe camera can be a star of films nhere its a coconspirator ndanielles convictions are compromised na socialist and a feminist she pretends to be royalty to get her man na kind woman her last act in the movie is one of revenge nthe most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish nthe fairy godmother standin leonardo da vinci patrick godfrey is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle nhuston is enjoyable in her overthetop wickedness nin all fairness my companion loved the film nmaybe its one of those chick flicks that men dont like nit is certainly a date film nnearly the entire audience was couples noh well maybe its good for something n
 something is fishy in the state of universal nabout ten years back with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior postapocalypse nittygritty survival yarns became popular at the movies nweve always had movies of this nature on the beach the end of the world damnation alley the ultimate warrior and so on nto date the most smoothly done were straightforward haircuts of the classic western plot like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization usually one in possession of some critical resource like water feed range or a mining claim nmost of these grew out of venerable but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane n my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn which was fairly well made on a small budget nnow we have waterworld which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter n well shes not a widow and the kid isnt her daughter but you get the idea nthe lady is helen played by the stunning jean tripplehorn who isnt given a chance to be stunning or even interesting by the mediocre and unimaginative script nthe child enola played by tina majorino is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie she outshines her material all the way through nin simple the scene is earth hundreds of years from now nthe polar ice caps have melted and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet nthe few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies and survive by trade theft or piracy nsomehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries and its inhabitants called smokers are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials so the bad guys have outboard engines and fastmoving boats airplanes and jet skis nenola found at sea as a young girl has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back nwe suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical dryland the place where trees crops and animals grow and what plot there is hinges on who has enola nthe psycho ruler of the smokers the deacon is trying to get her and find his way to dryland nplayed with typical selflampooning rugchewing histrionics by dennis hopper deacon is the only thing in the movie thats close to amusing nhis performance is almost laughable but there just isnt enough there to be funny nthe star and a coproducer is kevin costner nhes playing an unnamed lone denizen of the sea a man called the mariner who turns out to be a gilled waterbreathing mutant with webbed feet nvery little is done with this nthe script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted much of the earths surface would still be above water and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown n canned meat does not last for centuries ammunition does not fire after its more than a few decades old and so on and so on nim quite fond of tina majorinos previous work very impressed by jean tripplehorns past accomplishments and still speechless over costners dances with wolves nbut this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it nthis movie cost one hundred and eightytwo million dollars and theres nothing in it we havent seen before done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey nat 125 minutes of material this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make nthe budget of this movie could have given us over thirty movies it could have paid for six years of a primetime sf tv series with expensive fx work or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx nin sum this movie is beneath contempt nit has nothing new to offer it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation nif you have to go see it see it on a fourdollar matinee notherwise youll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface for weeks n
overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name based on shirley jacksons novel the haunting of hill house stars lili taylor as one of three lab rats that participate in a supposed insomnia study being initiated by liam neeson nhe is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it nhe drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of creepy cgi effects scare the cast and try the audiences patience ni know this question has been posed before but why do people keep remaking good movies nthe original was a great psychological horror film nthis new version is dull and very decidedly not scary nin fact i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg13 horror movie that is scary nunless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening then theres nothing in this film that will raise hackles ni nearly fell asleep twice during the film and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didnt seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed nits sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly nowen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability ncatherine zetajones always nice to look at is given the woefully underwritten role of a bisexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs nliam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about whats going on as the rest of them do nfinally poor lili taylor the center of the film gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her napparently a subplot involving a tryst between zetajones and taylors characters was filmed but removed nthats too bad because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative nthis is jan de bonts second straight misfire speed 2 cruise control being the first nwhen is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better nrobert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that none should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset nif de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything it would have served to make the film terrifying nwhat our mind fashions on its own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything napparently yet another version of this story is being filmed under its original title ni certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bonts version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had npg13 n
written by alex cox tod davies terry gilliam and tony grisoni ndirected by terry gilliam nive always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid ndropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat and no idea how long the ride will last nthen theres the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychninelaced dose nmushrooms on the other hand offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel a steady reassuring assent a short period of thrilling motion and color and then a smooth landing nacid is for daredevils mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy nmy point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas director terry gilliam has made an acid movie when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie nfull of shocking sight gags aggressive images and grotesque comic performances the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s thompsons book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological worldview from the inside out nbut for those of us who just want to enjoy a wellmade film gilliam has produced a mixed bag nfear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how selfprofessed gonzo journalist hunter s thompson johnny depp and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta benicio del toro came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorneys convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971 noperating under the pseudonyms of raoul duke and dr ngonzo the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite cocaine tequila and a rainbow of multicolored uppers and downers nthey terrorize every one they meet mostly because every one they meet terrifies them nduke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge ndr gonzo becomes enamored of a thickbladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplanes white rabbit reaches its climax nand these guys dont just trash hotel rooms they rape them humiliate them and leave them for dead nthat neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence depending on your point of view nthompsons book besides being a hilarious read has stood the test of time as an important historical document nit simultaneously exposed the 60s drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die npontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompsons message but the truth is that stripped to its bare essentials what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy nits a cheech and chong movie nyoure there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results see johnny take drugs see johnny fall down ntheres nothing wrong with this concept but gilliam tries too hard nthis is a frantic movie all sweaty closeups wideangle lenses dutch tilts and otherworldly lighting schemes nthere are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen nbut to what end nmuch of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompsons book and there are some priceless comic observations nbut youre hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work nthis brings us to the performances which strike me as all wrong ndepp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c scott in patton a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompsons dialogue nin between his several puking scenes del toro fares better as dr gonzo but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost nwatching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads now that would have been something to see nits interesting to note that alex cox credited as a cowriter on the screenplay was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over nas much of a fan as i am of gilliams work cox would have been the better choice nsid and nancy coxs best work covered essentially the same subject matter but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film ngilliam commits the compound sin of overdirecting his film while being uncertain of his purpose nwhat kind of movie was he trying to make anyway nit doesnt try to be a cautionary tale and it doesnt work as broad comedy nif he had considered more carefully his purpose the result would have been a much more interesting film nbut i dont want to be too hard on it nthere are some truly funny moments and if youre in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it ni do however recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance i guarantee it will enhance the effect n
theres a 1 000foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact nid say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies which are getting more irwin allen esque with every release nthe early wave of this revival while just as cheesy and laughable at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes ndeep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking nthe repeating cycle is as follows the president morgan freeman will go on tv and tell the country that theres a remote chance a comet will strike the earth but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem nthen we get to see the plan in action in some sequence utterly lacking suspense nthe mission will barely fail and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth and theres a remote chance it will strike but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem nit goes on and on throughout the movie but every time freeman goes on tv we know his plan is going to fail nhow do we know this nbecause weve seen the tv ads for deep impact ads that feature freeman telling the nation that the comet is still headed right for us and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading nladies and gentlemen that is the movie nsuccessful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30second tv spots ntelevision is whats wrong with deep impact nthe main character played by tea leoni is a lowlevel broadcast journalist for msnbc and thats the mere tip of the productplacement iceberg who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy nshe thinks its an instance of an exsecretary of something or other james cromwell resigning because of a mistress and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area nwhen she goes nosing around cromwell he begs her to keep it under wraps n i know youre just a reporter but you used to be a human being nshe figures out whats really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction level comet nupon a topsecret meeting with president freeman leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference at which she gets to ask the first question nand everyone knows if you get to ask the first question baby youre a star nleoni ends up in the anchor chair broadcasting every step of the comets collision course with earth nand im sure its comforting for her to know that even though the worlds ending in a matter of months shes a cable news personality nso there she is narrating the sixastronaut mission to blow the comet up nsuch personalities as robert duvall jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this draggedout process nbut as anyone whos seen the commercials knows the astronauts fail nthey only end up breaking the comet into two pieces which means even more destruction to the earth nyeah thanks nasa nthats when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who arent picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years nthey even have animals two by two ready to climb into the cave nif the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie ninstead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife while people pack the highways out of town nthe reasoning is of course that if a comet is going to strike they might as well be out in some scenic rural location nand amusingly the highway is spotted with people in uhaul trucks nim sure its comforting to know that even though the worlds ending in a matter of minutes the uhaul people are doing the most business of their lives n
im giving this stinker nnormally the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be nbut the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive helped me come to the big goose egg nim not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing or if he was even thinking at all nmaybe in mels little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny nin mine its not nor maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking nbecause only the selfrighteous lee uses the nword more often in his films than brooks did in this one nat least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing nbrooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it nwrong mel ni would call you a boob mel but that insults breasts everywhere nthis idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governors harvey korman attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad nhe sends his goons to run the townsfolk out nbut the town appeals to the governor mel brooks in one of many uninspired and unfunny roles to send them a new sheriff to protect them nthe governor pawns the task off to kormans character hedley lamarr n i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name nlamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff gasp in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave nhold on ive got to stop while these gales of laughter pass nits just too funny nracism passing as humor gosh why didnt anybody ever think of that one before noh wait i think somebody might have they are called the kkk nim not calling brooks a racist but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldnt know what was funny if it hit him over the head nbut i digress nanyway the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the nword ngolly will the hilarity just never end nhe ends up joining forces with a drunk gene wilder who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west ntogether they save the day from evil nnot one person in this movie gives a decent performance nwilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie nok he really didnt but he should have nthe films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day ni did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience ni admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions nactually the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise but alas it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie ni can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever nmel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film n
what hath kevin williamson wrought nwhile the horror movie revival spurred on by his scream has yielded a few decent entries in the genreiknowwhatyoudidlastsummer halloween h20 and scream2 it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films nthose williamsonless postscream efforts among them wishmaster and the recent disturbingbehavior have been frightening all rightfrighteningly insultingly bad nadd to that list urbanlegend which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy nthe influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas nfirst the opening sequence like that of scream is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling nthis sequence in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini natasha gregson wagner is decapitated while driving also reveals the other obviously williamsonesque touch the killers look ndressed in a large hooded parka wielding an axe the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the iknow fisherman nsans the hook none thing horta does not borrow from williamson however is the intriguing premise nstudents at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legendsthose contemporary bits of mythology passed from person to person group to group year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness nit hardly matters if they are true or not such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi he didnt nmichelle slain by the killer lurking in the backseat of lore is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true as the body count rises fellow pendleton student natalie alicia witt suspects not only a link between the murders but a personal link to her past as well nthe setup shows promise but the story never takes off due in large part to horta and the director the aptly named jamie blanks who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares ntoo many of the wouldbe shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues and the films chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that scream tried to subvert like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they shouldand couldrun out the front door nbut that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches theres also the climactic villain confession in which a contrived and waytooconvenient motive is revealed not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick which is a cliche in any film genre nbanks and hortas intentional attempts at humor are also lame the fact that the best gags are lazy injokey references to the other credits of costars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor nsome laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed but im not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so nthe filmmakers dont get much help from their onscreen talent ni was far from a fan of bland iknow nstarlet jennifer love hewitt but id talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesencechallenged leading man jared leto ndawsonscreek star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo gayheart displays all the depth and range of well a noxzema spokeswoman and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor ngranted the cast is hampered by their material nloretta devine who has done some fine work in films such as waitingtoexhale is saddled with the ridiculous role of a pam grierworshiping campus security guard nthe recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one mannamely kevin williamsonto stay alive nif other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as urbanlegend the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers many victims n
ironically one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life nunfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes watching this sad excuse for a movie nactually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldnt be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie nnot only is it a pathetically bad film overall but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever nthe plot is scattered thin and predictable the acting is monumentally bad and the style of film making resembles a home video nit is december 31 1981 and the big party is at monicas martha plimpton house nbut no one has arrived yet nher 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups nsome of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica and some are total strangers nbut they all are to face their own personal neuroses before nights end nthose who are invited are the ones that have the issues nit is up to those who arent to help them come to terms nfirst there is eric brian mccardie who is a former boyfriend of monicas and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance or lack thereof nhe is one of the most bland characters in a film full of dullness because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical a common trait of this poor production nbridget nicole parker and caitlyn angela featherstone who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new years eve and tag along to the party with them nthey stumble across a nameless bartender ben affleck who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections nhe is nether sexually deprived nor uncertain about his future as he is in law school nhis lack of flaws is both boring unrealistic and painful to watch nas bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the substandard comedy nmoving on there is val christina ricci and stephie gabby hoffman 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts nval is monicas cousin and a true fan of the new york scene non the other hand stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just cant find nparadoxically it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar actually they attempt to flee from their presence but arent successful who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds nof all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot nwisely the movies creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy courtney love and kevin paul rudd who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless npaul has just broken up with long time steady ellie janeane garofalo and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship nhowever the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening nfinally there are the two worst performances and worst subplot of the film njack jay mohr and cindy kate hudson have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindys virginity the night before nwhile she attempts to play this down and be her usual self he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy nvery often when a film is as putrid as this production there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory nhowever this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted ninstead what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts bad continuity and inaccuracies nfirst and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another there is no apparent order that it follows and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot nat other times objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot nthere are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish nnot in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver nand yet no matter how miserable this film may be and no matter how poor the acting is all around there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots nperhaps if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or perhaps even three there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development or quality acting or even a decent plot payoff at the end nbut it didnt happen that way nthe cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight n
the tagline for this film is some houses are just born bad nso i didnt expect too much from this nbut i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre ni thought liam neeson cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont ni thought mabe it will be fun nand in fact the beginning was rather intriguing nbut by the end of it i thought why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones jan de bont nthese great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality nhere is the story in the monstrously overdecorated mansion known as hill house visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor liam neeson into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation namong them is a sophisticated bisexual cathrine zeta jones a cynical dope owen wilson and a gentle and emotional lady lily taylor nactually the doctor is researching the primordial fear reaction and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens nbut he gets unexpected help from the house itself nit rumbles hums and belches forth remarkable sights nportals become veiny stainedglass eyeballs na fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth nfilmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains nbut the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real placing an emotional wall between audience and screen nthe second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture nis that exciting or what nthe worst thing about it is that it didnt have to be bad nits based on a great book the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson na 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent nit played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience n the blair witch project that cost less than an old car managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses nand with a 70 mill nbudget de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror nde bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is in itself frightening nhe is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush nbut why give him a more serious material nin the end haunting will only haunt its fledgling studio dream works skg and de bonts career as a director nyet it wouldnt be fair to say that everything is bad nthe effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated beautiful mysterious magical and spooky nbut this is where the good things end nthe music is blaring the floors moving the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming and all of this every second every moment of screen time is absolutely without life nits nothing more than a special effectsextravaganza visually impressive but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesnt engage nat first you do not know whats going on nis this part of the experiment nare these hallucinations nprojections of the subconscience nparanoia nbut in the end it shows out that this is actually happening nthe house is actually possessed nit is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window nfor ever i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and thats what i got ni believe hichock once said that its better to wait for a climax than to see one nthis may be true and it might actually work but there is only one problem jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary only stupid nthey are impossible to take seriously nany paralells that you might have heard before linking this picture to kubricks the shining are absolutely baseless n shining had class style story acting but most of all talent and originality n haunting has only special effects and art direction to boast of nand those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film ncasting good actors for small pale parts only makes things worse nbut i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write most of you will see this film anyway even if the tagline would say some films are just born stupid n
an attempt at florida film noir palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels nits slow moving uninvolving and plain just uninteresting nharry barber woody harrelson is an exnewspaper man just out of jail after being framed for a crime nhis luck hasnt been the best but things are looking up when a mysterious woman rhea malroux elisabeth shue approaches him with a proposition nshe wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get 500 000 out of her stingy but rich husband felix rolf hoppe nat first all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone and to collect the money of which he gets to keep 10 nbut as the deed is carried out things are not what they seem and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm npalmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film but the effect never quite comes together nits got the sultry florida heat seductive women and even curvier plot twists but the whole thing smells of paintbynumbers nsure the right ingredients are there but the end result is much too artificial na lot of the problems lie with the script which though providing some genuine surprises is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations neven the plot twists dont seem to flow well with the rest of the story nsome of them for example come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist for example harrys spontaneous job offer or the whole typewriter situation nthe characters are mostly lifeless played to type but not much more nwoody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thickheadedness that its hard to even picture him as an exjournalist nelisabeth shue vamps it up but doesnt add anything special to the role nchloe sevigny gives a terrible performance trying to be a sexy 17year old but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth nsome of the supporting cast notably gina gershon and michael rapaport give stronger but in the end meaningless performances nand to top it off the pacing of the film is much too slow nas the movie grinds to a halt youre given too much time to wonder why youre wasting it watching palmetto nif youre in the mood for this type of movie youd be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir n

okay bear with me yall cause first off i have to get this off my chest nwhat the hell is up with that damn crab nwhew okay ncause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end as cute as the crab maybe neven i know that you need more footage than that nand that wasnt the only thing getting on my nerves nthe cutesy gimmicks saccharine sweet score soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar as amanda and sean patrick flannery as tom might have held some appeal during oh say the first 10 minutes of the movie nat first the movie moves along at a quick interesting pace nit is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just doesnt die na ridiculous concept yes but at this point im willing to accept it because im willing to accept that this is how amandas life is changed how her powers are received nlater on the movie cant seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom nand this is why the clips of the crab were annoying they werent just repetitive they were out of place and unnecessary nthe plot stumbles along at an uneven speed sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development amanda suddenly becoming a great chef her falling in love with tom etc sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good nsome places the plot just doesnt make sense sometimes its way too contrived the crab bit for example and sometimes too corny peaches emitting dry ice ncant beat that nall in all the plot seemed fragmented unconnected nnot romantic at all and only funny in some places nso okay do the magic powers come from the crab nor the fairy godfather nshe can float now too nand all of a sudden instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches she can put her emotions into her food ntom all of a sudden just accepts amandas witchcraft in the end nwould people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupacs video nwhat the hell is up with that damn crab nit is unfortunate because i liked the basic premise of the movie until it became too fantastical and tiresome nthe film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least a theme for a while but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables nthe humor was good in some places nolan gets the funniest bits including that incomprehensible totally random thing with the dolls ngellar and flannery are qualified actors and gellar has a particular charm but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy or even annette in the upcoming cruel intentions than this sorry excuse for a character nits almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible nthe supporting character nolan was a highlight though he reminded me a bit of kevin in youve got mail see footnotes nand as always typical of a chick flick romantic comedy theres a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background cued up at all the right places nthis sort of got on the nerves after a while too n simply irresistible is not hard to understand light funny in some places and generally disappointing because it cant draw the line between romance and protracted sap between humor and tired slapstick nand how could i refrain from making a pun n n n n simply irresistible is all too easy to resist n first viewing 2699 n did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to youve got mail or the shop around the corner nbusiness rivals fall in love nfemale counterparts business is in danger of being shut down nfemale as mother like figure guiding her nthe annoying hysterical exgirlfriends n i really like sarah michelle gellars wardrobe n
at first glance i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise nits plotline goes like this the evil king cromwell desiring to take over the world resurrects an evil ancient sorceror xusia for power nhe attacks the kingdom of ehdan and kills young prince talons parents ngiven a triplebladed sword which can shoot bad guys like a gun by his dying father talon vows for revenge neleven years later when hes established his own army the mercaneries he vows to take back his kingdom nalong the way he meets up with alana whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell ntalon vows to help and after a series of minor escapades eventually ends up rescuing alanas brother and several other prisoners only to be captured himself in other words put on a cross to be crucified nfortunately he frees himself rescues alana from marrying cromwell defeats xusia and then cromwell all with his triple bladed sword during the final battle the blade breaks but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade nthen everything ends happily nunfortunately the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds nwhat would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping bad acting and gruesomely gory bloody scenes nnever once does the story seem to connect together it just jumps around repeatedly nthis problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia nafter telling him that he needs his help he leads the warlock out into daylight but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards nwait a minute didnt the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade ehdan which he cannot do by military force nif that is the case why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him nand why does he manage to take over ehdan anyway nthese questions are just never no never answered in the film nanother example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alanas wedding to cromwell and finally at the end instead of settling down with alana he just tells her to wait and then he just rides off nin addition to the extremely bloody scenes this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure neven some attempts to make it exciting a few fire scenes battle scenes dont work nit just completely fails altogether miserably nthe only good thing about this film is its musical score contributed by david whittaker who had an extremely short music composing career nthe score is boomy and adventurous powerful and a billion times better than this film is nmy suggestion steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead if you can find it nironically though before the films credits roll there is a message indicating that a sequel tales of the ancient empire would follow nto my relief and delight it never got into production because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office grossing only 39 million ncritics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer all right nleonard maltin rightfully called it second rate in scripting and acting and ataglance film reviews called it a confusing stupid unimaginative unengaging bloodfilled bore ni totally agree with these reviews all right and i hope that this piece of nwill be forgotten about nthere are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer ni hope you get a good laugh out of this review but i am not laughing nin fact my insults dont even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time n
suicide is pointless everyone should know that nso whats this movie like nyou guessed it npointless nthe virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them nwhen the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever nthats what the press materials for the film probably say nnow heres what i say the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time nboring arty pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as nwell as committing suicide nthe movie lost me early on immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window nthe girls father james woods holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on nthen as the scene ends the lawn sprinklers come on nis that a joke nis that supposed to be amusing in some way nfrom then on the movie failed to draw me back in nperformances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides nwoods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well ndunst has the potential to be a big star if she chooses her projects well nand while this film is awful she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed nthere are also a few cameos in the film here and there which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more nas a result they all seem rather pointless although theres a brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since nwell since eddie and the cruisers nperhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters nwe never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what theyre feeling nall we really know is that mrs lisbon kathleen turner is strict and keeps them on a short leash nwhat mother doesnt nits certainly no reason to commit suicide nwith the godfather part iii sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera nwith the virgin suicides she proves she has no business behind it either nhaving family connections doesnt entitle you to be allowed to make movies nso attention film directors nstop letting your daughters pout their way into the industry njust because they share your dna doesnt mean they share your talent nr n
robin williams has the rarest of gifts the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style noverwhelmingly his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best with the notable exception of flubber nso when i the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams tell you that not even williams can save his latest project you know its in trouble njakob the liar is a confused muddled little movie a generically uplifting film with a fundamental contradiction the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesnt realize it nwilliams plays jakob haim a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii none night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a highranking german officer for his punishment njakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast nthe announcement in english but punctuated by a triumphant heil hitler is that russian troops are only miles away from jakobs ghetto nliberation he thinks nthe next day jakob tells the news to his closest friend a volatile prize fighter named misha liev schreiber who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along nsoon it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home a crime punishable by death nthis is absurdly false but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate nthe danger of course is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger nin a curiously irrelevant subplot jakob finds a 11year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home napparently he is afraid that she will be discovered and goes to great length to make sure of that just why the idea frightens him is never made clear nhe and the girl build an uninvolving generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning nthe moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine nbut jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false nsuch hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations arent met the results are far worse than if there was no hope nthats the films biggest detriment it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false nits never moving because it doesnt give us anything to be moved by njakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing nrobin williams doesnt inject the film with life as a matter of fact he seems a little out of it as if crippled by his fake accent nhe is stragely unenthusiastic his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless hopeless nnot since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent this isnt the robin williams we know and love nin good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it nhere he is more of a wannabe serious actor an impostor njakob the liar will be compared with last years life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a holocaust comedy nits not a comedy nit tries sometimes but it rarely works nis it a melodrama na war movie na character study nno no and no njakob the liar is the kind of movie that cant be placed into a category not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts n
well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you nbecause thats all that there really is ni found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot nfor one thing a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity ni am not saying that this isnt possible nbut it does leave one to wonder i nknow i did nanother thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out nand certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations nthere was one scene that should have been short nbut it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking nok enough already get on with it nthere are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do nthings just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort nanother thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning nthis movie is also very predictable nyou can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment ngranted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you nalso some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated nit gets boring at times to tell you the truth neven though there is still action going on nanother little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero nsome of the characters are not proper for their roles nthe acting is fine but the characters just dont seem to add up nif i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldnt rate this movie too highly but thats just the thing this movie isnt just the plot its the whole package and this package is really well done nthe whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie nthe special effects are just amazing you cant tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live in a few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldnt be able to say that the creature wasnt there during filming extinct or not nanother thing is the destruction scenes nwow those were masterpieces nwell some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dinos make this one of the reasons to see this movie nthis movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office nunfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do ni may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments ngo see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me none little side note although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some people really want money badly nand i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance nyou know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made ni thought id put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick nits not that bad a movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this n
while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation we had yet another shoddy subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks nand once again we have one of the worst films of the year nthe trend of the moment and bear in mind its a trend not a movie is spawn and if youve seen the animated series on hbo youll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment hes been sent to hell ntodd mcfarlane the creator of the spawn comic book must have had a tough time sitting through spawn for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects style over substance ambience over anything else nnot only does spawn rely entirely on special effects the story about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of bad guys and find himself in the process is realized in such a sordid incapable manner it becomes indigestible after a while nevery character in this film is lifeless vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student nthe story begins like in every superhero movie in this age with a man living an idyllic life nal simmons michael jai white a government agentassassin shares the love of his wife wanda theresa russell and daughter has a tongueincheek wiseass partner terry d b sweeney and is content with the job his boss jason wynn martin sheen provides him nthe next element in the film is the part when things go awry nand as expected everyone turns the tables on poor al nas the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant al is befriended by jason and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene ninevitably it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away nhence jasons mischievous mastermind plan to conquer the world is just commencing its initial stages when al makes a pact with satan himself agreeing to command the devils army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again nso our pal al has been uplifted to hell and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place his ol partner terry forms a relationship with his wife ntime passes nand now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city the ghetto where cog nicol williamson teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts his motorbike armor etc nthis character is merely a poor mans obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla nnow the stage is set spawn the new enemy of evil vs evil nand evil takes the cake doubtlessly njohn leguizamos deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the films relief point nall this anguish pain halfbaked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo who steals the show and derives joy from his character which is basically a compilation of soso one liners nand then theres martin sheen nwhichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years nhis selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent nas the megalomaniac boss his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a bmovie scrambled and left in the shelf to rot nthis is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street nid never thought id be saying this but at this juncture charlie sheens career is in better shape nspawn is a movie in which realism or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable nfor most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling jumping through roofs and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better nit constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie a very bad superhero movie ncontinually the film kept on depending on special effects and sadly this is how pictures are being made nperhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry nthe filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible nthe quality of this film is abysmal and insulting nit is perceptible that director mark dippe attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burtons batman did touch the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act nbut bruce wayne had human elements to him nhe was pensive resourceful and had relationships which made our perspective on him equally human nthe character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change as if hes fatigued about being normal nand as all superheroes batman superman the phantom they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary nnone of this is present in spawn nthe fighting sequences are weakly executed the dialogue is pennydreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runners nas an example of this films vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten and then rescued by spawn so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic nadmittedly i did laugh once in the film and thats when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum nit is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature nbesides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn nmovies that present no admiration no captivation no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to nand kids will continue to see films like spawn simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one nchildren are not muppets nand spawn unapologetically targets children n
new address nsame old attitude ndont forget to recommend a film read the journal or send me some of that nasty hate mail nstarring bruce willis billy bob thornton liv tyler ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh and j j nabrams directed by michael bay nit rocksactually lots of rocks fly at us or from us in slow or fast motion at several points in the film nthey seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward and when they landonce in a while when we need a break from the space sequencesthey cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like n nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur nthey also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon a steroid users answer to deep impact nbruce willis stars as harry stamper a famed oildriller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond zero barrier and destroys our planet nwhy an oil driller nthey require someone experienced with deepcore mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid n in one unintentionally nhilarious sequence nasa asks harry to inspect a deepcore driller they built based on his own blueprints it is poorly constructedharry criticizes almost every aspect of it nwe trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids nharry assembles the obligatory ragtag bunch of cowboys including a blond guy a fat guy a black guy a wiseass and the man who is sleeping with his daughter affleck nonce they reach space we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrongperhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes nwhether or not they save the day i will not reveal nnor will you care ni will say this you know youre in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope nwillis has barely a chance to come alive ditto for affleck ntheir big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act in a last minuteand futileattempt to inject warmth into the material nsteve buscemis characterthe wiseassis exceptionally problematic n rockhound as hes called is sarcastic and foolish so they tape him to a chair where he spends most of the film nso why did they bring him up there to begin with nrather why write him into the film give nhis almostwitty oneliners to serious willis who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig nim guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel at least in my world where the sky is blue nliv tyler is pretty and humourless as always suspiciously four of her fathers bands aerosmith songs grace the soundtrack ndirector michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick like ketchup eventually drowning the movie onscreen n the middle hour is a nonsensical pyrotechnic assault on the average primates brain nwhenever someone dies in this movie a crew member inevitably yells out we lost insert dead persons last name here ni must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oilguycumastronaut from a live one and closeups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance as their skin was often covered in fake blood narmageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla nit looks nicer and has fewer plotholes within its equally ludicrous framework nit has a vivid soundmix nbut at almost twoandahalf hours i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story nthe love story has been played up in the ads perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanicfever nbollocks nthe lovers in the film are miles apart throughouterase all thoughts of nude sketching or carsex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a mooncrawler nremember a little film called jaws nin this film three independentminded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark nthey didnt much like each other at first eventually they started to respect one another none of jaws great scenes involved the wouldbeahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories nthis is the sort of malebonding foreign to bay or his producer jerry bruckheimer who throw too many characters into the mix and expect well care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end nnot once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintancesid be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before action was called na male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who dont bare their souls who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chestbeating bravery nto this i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic nor brave nor smart even this team couldnt build a birdhouse nand if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailera trailer for a movie written by a team of bodybuilders and greeting card authorsive never been a prouder wimp my whole life n
synopsis original jurassic park survivor alan grant neill is tricked by paul and amanda kirby macy and leoni into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur to rescue their stranded son ngrants team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought nreview there is one reason why jurassic park iii is better than its immediate predecessor the lost world jurassic park nthe latter wasted 129 minutes of my life the former only 94 nthe first park was a marvellous film full of aweinspiring sights interesting characters and genuine thrills nits two successors have been pale imitations amounting to hundredmilliondollar bgrade horror movies nat least this third entry realises it whereas the lost world tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot jurassic park iii simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin nthere is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie the computeranimated dinos are no longer novel or exciting and even the firsttime presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation nremember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie nnothing in this rehash even comes close nadd in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman payne and taylor and phonedin performances by the normally capable macy and leoni and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts nat least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character and there is much less gore than in the lost world making this installment more suitable for children n

 in dreams might keep you awake at night but not because of its creepy imagery bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths nno the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movies brutally squandered potential the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise even by tired serial killer genre standards nthe big letdown however comes upon the realization that this 100minute headscratcher was masterminded by neil jordan the man behind the crying game nhes no stranger to cinematic weirdness but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope nthings start out strong enough with cinematographer darius khondjis stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat nthis eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film theres even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic seemingly innocent new england autumn but if there ever was a film that didnt deserve so good a polish its this one ndont knock the look but say what you will about the foolish plot underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue nannette bening another asset in dreams shouldnt be so lucky to boast gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesnt do much for her in return nshe plays claire cooper a massachusetts childrens book illustrator whos plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children nshe thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible soontobecommitted crimes but neither her hohum husband aidan quinn nor the hohummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously nthis being a thriller we know that she is in fact on the money and its a credit to benings acting that she delves equally into claires madness and compassion nbut as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims in dreams trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense nscenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition nsubplots appear and disappear nwhen claire finally comes facetoface with our evil murderer robert downey jr it turns out his name is vivian hes clairvoyant and hes got some major issues with mama a la norman bates n in dreams reaches its absurdist zenith here and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists nsome questions then whats with the garbage disposal retching applesauce nare the drawings on the wall blood or paint nwho cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own nwhat about the computer ndoes vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers nwhy would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan nis the woman in australia integral to anything nand the aforementioned flooded city what function does that really serve nsigh nat least in my own dreams i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didnt go to waste n

i love movies ni really do nevery time i watch great movies like goodfellas 1990 or raiders of the lost ark 1981 a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent skill and entertainment that is on display neven lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 13 1994 or ghostbusters ii 1988 while not exactly brilliantly well made are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value nthen theres my favourite martian the exact opposite of what a movie should be a hurried poorly written and acted movie with one goal to make money ndisney ever since the lion king 1994 have lost their magic touch but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk nchristopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t v reporters tim ohara car daniels and soon tim finds the martian in his home trying to recover and fix his spaceship nalong with his zoot spacesuit voiced by wayne knight must fix his spaceship before it explodes and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public firstly by ohara but later by rival t v presenter brace channing hurley by calling himself tims uncle martin nlaughter is supposed to arise from the comical events but never does nmany bad films have good intentions but my favourite martian doesnt appear to try to provide any entertainment nfilled to the brim with wham bang special effects my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy nchristopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie ive never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now njeff daniels plays staple nice guy and his role is useless nhis performance is incredibly lazy although his paperthin character doesnt deserve more than the performance he gives ndarryl hannah looks as pretty as ever but her role is somewhat erm limited nhurley mistakes acting for shouting and looking like a twit and wins the david wilcock award for most irritating godawful performance in a moving picture nway to go liz nfor the supporting cast disney manage to assemble every character actor out there during the film i was going he was the guy in ah er nbefore finally giving up and switching off nanother major setback is the staple comedy sidekick nunfortunately the writers sherri stoner and deanna oliver if anyone cares forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be funny ninstead they deliver zoot the martians deeply unfunny sidekick nalthough meant to be a manic character no doubt every line that comes out of his neck is a dud na real dud ncitizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester neven the kids in the audience were insulted by this character not one child even bothered to smirk nits a nice special effect though nanother problems with this comedy are the gags themselves nor rather the lack of them nmy favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour it goes past the bowl down the pipe and into the sewer nnow toilet humour can be funny as dumb and dumber 1994 humorously showed nbut here characters farting belching and almost getting crapped on literally is not amusing nits insulting ntheres one good gag right before the credits but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued neither that or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldnt mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes nyes men at work nyowza nthe fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more nthere are thousands of brilliant films out there that cant get distribution yet trash like this gets released nationwide with ease nthankfully as soon as it makes its money it will never be seen again and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie down the toilet n
sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality nhe is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades like twelve angry men serpico or the verdict nbut in the same time almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumets reputation na stranger among us 1992 ripoff of peter weirs witness belongs to the latter category nthe heroine of this movie is emily eden melanie griffith tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york nduring one of such actions her partner nick jamey sheridan got hurt and as a result she becomes depressed nin order to help her recover bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community nemily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder nconcluding that the perpetrator belongs to community she decides to go undercover nthat isnt easy because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways nthings get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel eric thal nusing peter weirs formula isnt the greatest flaw of this film neven the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent nbut the worst insult to viewers audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith nthe author of this review never liked this actress very much but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles nrole of emily eden unfortunately isnt one of them nfirst of all she cant pass for tough nypd street fighter and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isnt much better nscreenplay by robert j avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch nbut on the other hand other actors are more convincing lee richardson as an old rabbi thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community nalso the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture nthat is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time n
in this years summer movie preview issue of entertainmentweekly theresa connelly described her writingdirecting debut polishwedding as a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would none wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film a comedydrama that appears doomed at its most basic elements nthe family at the center of polishwedding is the pzoniaks which consists of mother jadzia lena olin father bolek gabriel byrne sole daughter hala claire danes and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness nits a large family but theres not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch certainly not in the primary trio njadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family but shes kind of a hypocrite since shes carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija nher excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration nalso how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy sexy jadzia nhala is a spoiled selfcentered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy nwith such an unappealing set of characters its no surprise that polishweddings plot complications are far from involving nnaturally jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop russell schuster adam trese who fathered the child but he refuses to make such a commitment nhohum nanother complication involving the decidedly unvirginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary is first played for laughs and then inexplicably as a profound statement in the films climaxwhich ironically is funnier than any of the films lame attempts at humor such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell nthat scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly nthe jadziabolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers nthe halarussell conflict isnt resolved in as contrived a manner but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something nand then theres some atrocious dialogue which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound look at all these pickles njust looking at them gives me such great sadness nas misguided as polishwedding is the affair is something of a letdown considering the strong performances by byrne danes and especially the fiery olin nthey obviously believed in connelly and her materiala faith that audiences will be hardpressed to share n
 battlefield earth is the best comedy of the year nit has to be nthe other prospect is just too horrifying to consider nbad movie syndrome struck me again so after witnessing how much battlefield earth has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster firsthand nis it as bad as advertised noh yes very much so nthe plot is incomprehensible nthe acting is atrocious nthe special effects are mediocre nthe action is dull nthe implausibilities are legion nthe dialogue is cringeinducing nthe whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny ni dont even want to continue reviewing this movie id like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory so here it is nthe premise is basically a ripoff of planet of the apes only minus the apes and philosophical discussion and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo nthe year is 3000 the psychlos have conquered earth and the human population has been enslaved nonly a handful of humans escaped to radiationrich areas to escape the aliens they live out their lives in fear none man johnny goodboy i know i know tyler barry pepper ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos nthere he confronts the psychlo head of security a big ugly klingonlooking creature called terl john travolta npressed into slavery johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back nmeanwhile terl is faced with his own problems he has recently learned that hes stuck living on earth which he hates for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big mans daughter nhe decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology this is where the plot gets ridiculous n n nso the mananimal can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos cant go nterl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself nof course his plan doesnt work nso many things wrong with this movie where to begin nhow about with travolta whose hollywood clout brought about this the cinematic version of scientology guru l ron hubbards scifi novel nearly previews for battlefield earth with constant shots of a makeupladen travolta cackling like lex luthor had me and several audience members remarking what the hell is travolta thinking nthe movie did nothing to stem such remarks nall that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here terl cackles after nearly every line and so does every other psychlo nof course this makes every scene hilariously overwrought no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary nthe psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america but ceos generally dont laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees n you were going to be promoted but now youre not nfwahahahahahahahaha nits no big surprise terl loses to the humans hes an idiot nhe breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book nhe underestimates his enemies assuming hell win just because hes smarter n he uses the word leverage like some sort of scientologist mantra nnot content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos language and technology n why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me nhe then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him nno wonder this guy never got his promotion nthe plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention nwhy do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive nhow come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open nhow in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 000 years nand how do all these previously braindead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ntheres a whole lot more to scratch ones head about in battlefield earth nbring a scorecard to track the plot holes ndirector roger christian shoots battlefield earth in the most distracting way possible tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason nall the characters appear to be standing on the walls and its awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue nthe action sequences are atrociously edited every one turned into an endless slowmotion parade that drains all potential excitement nare these things really so hard to construct nmy respect for supposed lightweight action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in battlefield earth how badly an action sequence can be shot nthis movie is an absolute headache nits not just the shot selection and editing the movie quite frankly makes no sense nfor most of battlefield earths running time i just didnt know what was happening nit didnt have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical though they certainly are i really had no idea what the hell was going on nwhen i pieced the plot together later it didnt look any better nheres how much of a disaster this is battlefield earth is already the worst movie of the year and its going to take something really really inept to top it nthe only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it nin fact id think that hubbards cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible nthatll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again n

can a horror movie truly be called a horror movie if it has no scares suspense or even eerie elements ni think not but thats what children of the corn 666 issacs return wants us to believe nthe sixth installment in the horrible worn out series is by far the worst to date nunlike the other five chapters children of the corn 666 is a confusing brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror but either way none of these movies are the least bit scary nthe film follows hannah natalie ramsey a teen looking for her mother in gatlin nebraska on the eve of her 21st birthday nwhat starts out as a daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder nthats about all thats understandable in the film as after we learn this much issac john franklin who led the children of the corn in a previous chapter now an older strange man is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy nand this is supposed to make sense nreally nfrom the start the film is unclear of where its going not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film nthe film runs at a short 78 minutes but it seems to be more in the vicinity of two hours as the bleak slow pacing makes children of the corn 666 issacs return excruciatingly boring nplot holes are everywhere in tim sulka and john franklins unbelievably horrible script as nothing is accomplished or clear when the film reaches its conclusion neveryone and everything involved with children of the corn 666 issacs return namely writers john franklin and tim sulka along with director kari skogland should crawl under a rock and hope no one sees their horrible work of trash nthe bottom line horrible horrible horrible nanother attempt to revive this worn out genre falls flat nand whats with that title nthe devil has nothing to do whatsoever with this film nlets pray that this is the finale in one of the worst current film series none of the worst horror films in years n

underwater science fiction stays submerged nsphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman none of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents nyou keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered npsychologist norman goodman dustin hoffman is called

1 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years nhaving written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship nhis group as outlined in his report consists of beth halperin sharon stone a biochemist harry adams samuel l jackson a mathematician and ted fielding liev schreiber an astrophysicist

and explore the stilloperational ufo ndiscovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere nwhen adams enters the sphere the weirdness

audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes nthe first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification nits much like speedreading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances nit doesnt get any better when the action scenes begin nwhile the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles the people are still flat noddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them nafter adams experiences the interior of the sphere no one bothers to ask him what happened ntheir history together is an intriguing plot

difficult to follow nalthough some of the disorientation eventually is understandable a great deal of it isnt neven a science fiction film must be internally consistent ntheres too much here that doesnt make sense nare the manifestations real nthe jellyfish kill queen latifa in a throwaway role and the squid nearly destroys the outpost but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect na scene in the sub suggests that its illusion but earlier episodes indicate that its not nnot everything has to be explained to death but there are major questions that the film never answers nwhere the ship came from is clarified but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to neven the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll nthe climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale nafter prerelease audience testing the actors were called back to reshoot the ending nits difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse nfollowing the recent tradition of lengthy films this weighs in at over two very long hours nthe weak scenes could have been cut but then there wouldnt have been much left nthe movie was supposedly held up by effects work but theres nothing special on the screen nwe never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm nstealing from alien the abyss and the disastrous event horizon this film has learned nothing from them nremarkably levinson and hoffmans other currently showing film is wag the dog a smart and entertaining piece of work nthis one could have been titled the same sans one word n
so its thirty years later and oscar and felix are together again nthat might have been an exciting notion if it wasnt for the fact that the odd couple of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies 1993s grumpy old men 1995s grumpier old men and 1997s out to sea i e n grumpiest old men nso the odd couple ii i e n the grumpiest old men of all really seems just another entry in a tired series nthe plot is even similar to that of grumpy old men in that lemmon and matthaus mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children noscars son jonathan silverman and felixs daughter lisa waltz are getting married and former roommates felix ungar lemmon and oscar madison matthau meet at the airport and decide to share a car n n nthen hilarity ensues nwell a few chuckles ensue anyway nneil simon the awardwinning playwright who created oscar and felix provides the screenplay which is a shock because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end nunlike the original playmovie odd couple ii doesnt find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters ninstead it depends upon a series of humorous situations oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff are caught smuggling mexicans over the border take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands the women are played by christine baranski of cybill and jean smart of designing women and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert nthe original 1968 movie the odd couple remains a classic comedy nit introduced the motif of roommateasspouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since nit was the second outing for the lemmonmatthau team which debuted in 1966s the fortune cookie and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies the front page 1974 and buddy buddy 1981 before going their separate ways nthe reunion of lemmon and matthau in grumpy old men six years ago was delightful and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie nbut out to sea and the odd couple ii are just beating a grumpy old horse n you can add lemmons my fellow americans i e n grumpy old presidents to that list too nlets hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do nlets hope also that we see neil simons name on movies that do it justice this is his first since 1993s lost in yonkers n

the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities nthe best tales of the genre deal with mankinds struggle for survival or knowledge nsuch popular and noteworthy tomes as stranger in a strange land by robert heinlein childhoods end by arthur c clarke and man in the high castle and do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k dick all deal with mans need for identity and struggle for self worth nhollywood has regularly adapted the milieu if not the message of science fiction since its beginnings nmost films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved nit really wasnt until producer george pal took charge of robert heinleins novel rocketship galileo and crafted the film destination moon that scifi as it is commonly referred to came into its own nfrom there such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre nwith the release of touchstone pictures mission to mars we have an unabashedly nonchalant scifi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe nthe film opens on a summer barbecue as phil ohlmyer jerry oconnell woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission nwoody blake tim robbins and his wife terri connie nielsen commit to his coming authority on the mission and luc goddard don cheadle consoles his son nentering the party is jim mcconnell gary sinise who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife maggie kim delaney nluc consoles jim with woodys assistance nthe three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them nbut jim still longs to set foot on the red planet nthe mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars nthey send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface ngoing out to investigate luc and his team approach the famed face on mars na strange noise emanates from the rock nas the team tries to scan through the rock with radar a violent wind storm erupts creating a vortex that kills all members of the team save for luc nback on the space station orbiting earth woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing nlucs interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team nthe second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger nmeteorite showers explosions and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planets surface nthe big question is is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars nand if so what is its relationship with us nnow for the bad news nthe entire plot of mission to mars is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe nthe famed face on mars becomes the centerpiece of the film revealing some of the most harebrained scifi pabulum the screen has witnessed nborrowing ideas from such films as robinson crusoe on mars 1964 quatermass and the pit 1967 2001 a space odyssey and even mario bavas planet of the vampires terrore nello spazio 1965 mission to mars is a hodgepodge of ideas that dont add up to a satisfying whole nwhile some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed the film remains flat and uninvolving nso much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film but to no good use nthe performances are all workmen like with only don cheadle as luc carrying any sort of real chemistry ngary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation nand the mistaken idea of having jerry oconnell as phil ohlmyer play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse nand the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better nhes just having too much fun here to give a damn nthe script has a few lapses namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage nthis of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship nalso when one character sacrifices himself the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation nbut the biggest offence in the film is the horrid intrusive score by ennio morricone nsubtlety is nonexistent here nin fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out nthe only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower nthe pacing of the film is very leisurely nafter the opening introduction of the characters which lasts a full 22 minutes we are finally dropped onto the martian surface nthen there is another long pause in the plot for more character development including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity nthe film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum nthere are so many scenes of talking heads discussing what we already know is going to happen that it drags the film to a dead stop nthe good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at nthe vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring nthe design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted with a level of realism that hasnt been seen since 2001 a space odyssey nthe visual effects are just stunning from the space walk sequences to the visualization of evolution on earth nthe only fault come with the martians themselves which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world ndirector de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film nthe opening sequence alone in a seemingly uninterrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes an homage to hitchcocks rope as we are introduced to all of the characters nscenes in the rescue ship with its rotating centrifuge are just amazing in their execution nbut the nagging question is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang nsadly it is not ndirector brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production nthe set design and visual effects are all arresting nbut its the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous thought provoking science fiction na disappointing film but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals n
the first in a very long list of things wrong with i still know what you did last summer is the title nthink about it for a second nif the last movie was called i know what you did last summer wouldnt the next movie have to be i still know what you did two summers ago nif anyone working on this movie had an i q ngreater than five would have thought about it logically and said hey nwait a minute nbut alas the people behind this film are obviously idiots so i wont hold them to that nwhat i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands even for a teenage slasher flick ni guess im one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film emphasis on the kind of nit wasnt great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good but at least it didnt have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like its sequel did nthere are just so many problems with this movie that its hard trying to figure out where to start nfirst of all i guess is the setting nthe movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting nexactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james jennifer love hewitt one of the only survivors of the first film and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up nthe movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through nin one scene julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress cant get out no matter how hard she tries nwhen julie discovers shes going to slowly fry to death she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue nnow this is all fine and dandy except for one thing instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth why not just turn the freakin thing off nin another scene one of the characters after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker says to julie just dont tell anybody it rained the whole time noh yeah ive just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered but hey ill crack jokes anyway nafter all it is in the script nthe films only saving graces are a few wellexecuted suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the reanimator himself jeffrey combs nhe brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie nway to go jeffrey ni have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept its head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson nwith scream and even its sequel he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter nhis ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers and i think i still know has really suffered by not having him on board nthe cool atmosphere is still there this time around but i just didnt like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one neven though the movie doesnt have williamson it still has a hacky ending trying to do what kevin did with the first two scream s by some may consider this a spoiler but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes having two killers and this time having one of them being a family member to the other ni think someone in the audience put it best when after the movie had ended with another the killer is back ncliffhanger he said who is this time the grandma nall in all i still know tries to be as successful as the first the film was but really fails in the attempt ni mean its okay when slasher movies ripoff each other but when they start copying themselves n
there isnt much good about this movie nnot much i can say about the acting directing or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie nso ill get my one good comment out of the way at least joel schuemacher batman robin didnt direct it or it would be titled technicolor city nin fact there is nothing colorful about this movie its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end nthe plot has a tendency to be interesting but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie nthe plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets so i will just touch on the bare minimum njohn murdoch rufus sewell awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel only to find out he has forgotten everything njohn must find out who he is before the strangers a k a nmind erasing aliens find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy nduring the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality and the existence of inherently evil people nany of these points however are completely erased from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script nas i mentioned earlier nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film nthe acting is bland and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care nthe special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake a sign of a true bmovie nthe direction is poor and there is little continuity not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly nlastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality and doesnt deserve to have the word science in sciencefiction nif i havent got my point across ill say it more plainly this is a bad movie nlets hope the next movie by alex i wish i was tim burton proyas is at least tolerable n
it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels you must suspend disbelief nhowever there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies nit came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg indiana where the film is set does not have a mcdonalds a sears store a statue of a man on a horse nor even a dam close by neven if you can ignore these somewhat white lies even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot there is still a bunch of things that just dont gel nfirstly morgan freeman possibly the greatest actor alive after such films as driving miss daisy the shawshank redemption and se7en was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement nhe should have played the town sheriff an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman nas a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases ni say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them and it seems a tad strange that an entire town with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way can vanish before the flood has actually started nbut nether the less armored guard couriers tom christian slater and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van nwith a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads it doesnt take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road njim morgan freeman and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars nbut of course tom is more than willing to save the day so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town nthe local sheriff randy quaid whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 and a couple of police men investigate the situation but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what heshe would do with their share of the three million dollars ndirector mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsyturvy and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite goodies versus baddies there are numerous twists in its plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience nbut by the time these interesting changes occur its far too late in the film for them to have much affect nhard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par nnot at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected nsuch titles as broken arrow slater and john travolta and faceoff nicholas cage and john travolta come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations nstrangely enough they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta nwe can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character nif you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow my answer would have been a definite no ni now know that he has no excuse and can do better if you dont believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store nalthough hard rain never really works from the start i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen nthe addition of an enticing subplot would have given the film time to breathe rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that cant handle anything else ndespite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film nno creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors but it doesnt really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about 8 50 is compare this to other films n
watching the movie i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup cute n cuddly computergenerated monkey nif the monkey died the movie got an extra half star nalas the monkey showed up at the end unharmed to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs nwhat that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars nthats pretty generous considering the movies camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek nwhen will robinson jack johnson teaches his pet robot about friendship you are actually supposed to buy it nso why such a seemingly high rating nthere are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage nfirst we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater nthe sound and screen kicked ass nnobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did and i dont necessarily mean that in a good way nalso there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons or getting caught up in the movies tension ni even liked the computergenerated settings ni usually prefer to see models or sets but the cg was more detailed than ive seen in a lot of movies it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities nalso gary oldman is never a bad actor even though he is typecast as a villain nwilliam hurt isnt too bad either nneither actor had a great role but their performances were watchable nand perhaps i shouldnt admit this but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood nthere is very little swearing or blood there is a strong moral message saccharine though it is there is a bit of romance whose culmination after 2 hours is a real kiss no sex nit felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six nthose movies were probably as bad as lost in space but at the time they were manna from heaven nthat type of moviemaking is a lost art nnow for the bad news nworst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue nits squeakyclean family fun trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction n you better hold on to your joystick is one such line nand when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign nsecond worst and closely related is the screenplay nthe storys exposition takes place at a press conference which allows the writers to explain whats happening with the least amount of creativity effort or interest nonce the story gets going i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while but on the whole the situations that arise are silly and contrived nwhen gary oldman easily reprograms wills pet robot to kill the robinsons my friend summed it up perfectly he flipped the switch to evil nthen theres the tone of the movie nthe colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson nthen it could be an adventure movie ntheyre mostly right except that johnson will wasnt a good enough actor to carry it off nstill that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination njust because a movie is tame enough for kids doesnt mean that we have to bow to a promise keepers notion of whos the center of a family nmany quality family films have been made with a nontraditional family structure fly away home comes to mind to much better effect nand the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie nin star wars the rebels were the good guys nwe were rooting for those who were fighting against the system nin lost in space the rebels are the bad guys a terrorist force that must be killed crushed and silenced so that our children may live free nthat ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists nfinally a few specific details deserve criticism nthe movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 nwhy nwhy bother saying what year this is njust tell us its the future ni bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 nsetting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it wont be timeless not that this movie was really in the running anyway nthen there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole nthis silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunnys barber chair and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers havent learned a thing about ergonomics none vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed it made lost in space look cool nthe strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and out of context made it sound hip nthis is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie nbut if thats the best part of the movie i cant in good conscience recommend it nstill if you get stuck seeing it as we did you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance think of liking bad movies as a child and bring along your bad movie bingo cards n
working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a frontline african american actress like jada pinkett smith ndespite being one of the freshest talents available pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts a low down dirty shame the nutty professor nthe problem is of course that there arent many good roles available for black women ntake away the likes of waiting to exhale set it off soul food and eves bayou and all thats left is a chance to be someones girlfriend a local whore or a murder victim nas a result for pinkett smiths first opportunity atop the marquee she is stuck in a stupid formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo nactually woo the latest directorial effort from daisy v s nmayer party girl could have been worse than it is nthe film offers a few funny albeit juvenile moments and the onscreen relationship between pinkett smiths woo and tommy davidsons tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two arent forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags nunfortunately huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a tripledigit i q nthe situations are painfully contrived the main characters are lifted right out of sitcoms and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of free lobotomy lab experiment nwoo is a spontaneous energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places nher latest relationship with a testosteroneoverdosed drugdealer came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper nnow her transvestitemedium friend celestrial girlina predicts that shes about to meet mr right and that hell be a virgo nlater that day woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order who just happens to be a virgo nits not love at first sight however nthings get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a quiet dinner nin the onehundred year history of motion pictures there have been a ton of bad white movies about mismatched lovers so i suppose its only fair that we get a black effort of the same low caliber nas in all romantic comedies we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together nthe question is are their courtship rituals entertaining nin a good entry to the genre the audience becomes caught up in the love story no matter how familiar it is nin woo the constant reliance upon unfunny moronic humor sinks the project nfor those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes theres a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top nsadly thats one of the films most enjoyable sequences and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional ndespite exuding charm from every pore theres little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c johnsons script nsince it misses the mark by so much a better name for woo might have been whoops n
if youre the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn butter optional then this is the movie for you nindeed this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative ripoffs of other recent action movies or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them nits difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film nbut at least were warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show nwhat are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie nfirst the movie gives us an introductory premise nhuge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor and in this area many ships have disappeared noooh scary nsecondly a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score nthird the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo treat williams nhe operates a sophisticated militarystyle pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy nfinally in the cargo hold we see those that hired him nthey are also mercenaries that have toughlooking haircuts talk with accents and try to show how macho they are nduring their trip across the stormy sea their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs nspotting a cruise ship in the distance they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop take the parts that they need and then continue on their merry way nlittle do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster nyet they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds nthis is nothing more than a bythebook action film ntheir realization of the situation that theyre in doesnt happen until they are in the bowels of the boat nthose who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed nthe corridors on the ship are narrow misty and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scarefests must have nyet despite the predictable nature of this film there are some scary boo moments nbut most of it is just outright silly nand this film is unusually gory too nmonsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains nthere is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive nhe screams horribly as the monsters digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away nadditionally it borrows heavily from speed2 alien and a bunch of other recent films nthe mercenaries even run into a lone surviving passenger femke jannsen who looks amazingly like sandra bullock nto be honest when i left the theatre i just had to laugh at how witless the film was nits moronic fun at best nso if youre hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness then this might just hit the spot n
one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles nhe has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish and one of his best was his last film lone star nafter sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the usmexico border expectation ran high for his next film nunfortunately his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for nwe are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do nthen the film does exactly what it promised a painful as that is nthe plot of men with guns can be summarized in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas ndr fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went nand he found out again and again and again nof course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell na guerrilla war is always bad for civilians nbut the film talks down to the viewer ndr fuentes played by federico luppi teaches medicine in the capital city of his country nhe has as a great humanitarian gesture trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios nfuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service nthen he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy nin shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others nthe student tells him the others are still in the mountains but suggests that it may not be a good place to be nfuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general nthe results are little different than one would expect ndr fuentes starts out incredibly naive neven some american tourists present in the film mostly for comic relief seem to know better than dr fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains nbut fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was nsayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians nthe cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences nfederico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos ndamian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter nmandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer n
retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year nearlier this may leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the toprated miniseries that debuted on cbs nand now director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies nstarring milla jovovich who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch the messenger the story of joan of arc is a disjointed and overblown historical reenactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend nbesson whos previous work includes the hyperactive scifi the fifth element perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in exwife jovovich because in the messenger the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience nat first when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber nafter seeing the rousing trailer my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed milla jovovich looked superb nwith the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance the messenger looked like a timeless epic in the making na timeless epic it is not nbesson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style and the story behind the messenger is not entirely suited to his demands non the shoulders of bessons choppy and unexciting direction the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery nthere is no human exploration into the character of joan or jeanne njovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective njovivichs unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard nshe is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast njovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power but mainly she looks lost nquite frankly i dont know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through the messenger without a major fumble nthe script is chockfull of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii john malkovich and informs him of her heavenly intentions nfaye dunaway plays charles overbearing motherinlaw and dustin hoffman appears over twohours into the story as a character dubbed the conscience nall three actors juggle limited screen time although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful nthe battle scenes are extremely bloody but with the presence of such jittery camera work they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like braveheart ntheres a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on when jeanne as a young girl watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier neven his fellow troopers are petrified nthe messenger is also strictly a 90s update on the classic story nalmost too 90s it seems ntheres gratuitous use of the fword and a barrage of slang terms like shes nuts nsprinkled throughout the screenplay ni was halfexpecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib but it never happened ntheres also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly nit seems terribly misplaced but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as the messenger almost everything does nthe musical score by erric serra is spectacular and the set and production designs are continuously impressive nif it was visual excellence that besson was striving for then he achieves his goal nbut the only time the dramatics come alive in the messenger is during the closing trial in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake nduring these moments the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning nits just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects nthe messenger the story of joan of arc is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf nanyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film ndespite my original hopefulness milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy n

the crown jewel of 1970s irwin allen disaster movies the poseidon adventure features an allstar cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship nthe story begins on the u s s nposeidons big new years cruise where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive nlets see theres the new age preacher hackman who advises people to pray to that part of god within yourself ntheres the excop borgnine who busted a hooker stella stevens six times then married her ntheres the hippie singer theres got to be a morning after who turns to the company of a lonely man red buttons once her brother is killed nand to round out the group the elderly couple jack albertson and shelley winters who live aboard the ship the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall nwe get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure before straight faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship neveryones in the giant ballroom at the time shortly past midnight of the new year when the ship turns first on its side then completely upside down nthe second incommand wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship nin this case because the ship is overturned the top is the bottom nor is the bottom the top neither way we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and in the ballroom scene christmas trees nthus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors through burning rooms etc while the ship slowly fills with water behind them nits a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting nthe poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at with all the melodrama that comes inbetween the nonthrilling action scenes nthe one note in borgnines onenote performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love although since there isnt a sex scene we never find out if his buttons really are red and albertson and winters wonder if theyll live to see their grandsons birth nshelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along nwinters who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie stevens even notso affectionately calls her fatass in one scene finally finds her purpose n i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen she brags and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years shes swimming through the water her skirt billowing up around her hips showing off her cellulite or do you call it shellulite nridden thighs nits not so much funny as innately disgusting which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole n
and just when you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners not rating anything lower than your standard this movie sucks along comes this cinematic atrocity and hes forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with a stench so thick even the bravest moviegoer would think twice about seeing this waste of time nyes despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie the latest highlander doesnt seem to have anything going for it noh stinky movie let me count thee ways nplot from what i understood a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal or nsomething along those lines ncritique a complete and utter mess ndisjointed incoherent boring corny filled with bad dialogue and nthats just the first thirty minutes nthis film doesnt seem to know what to do with itself nits confusing to anyone who doesnt know the series i include myself in that group and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series i include diehard highlander fan the arrow in that group nthe film doesnt explain anything about itself it njust goes from one inexplicable situation to another none moment theyre in the present time the next moment theyre in italy in the 1600s nwhy nwho knows nwhat are they talking about nno idea nflashbacks mixed in with the present mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene nhullo nconfused yet ni was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story nrandom swordplay mad maxlike dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s nor were they in the present at that time nwho knows and to be honest who nseriously cares nthis series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago but sadly someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it nplease please for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of moviemaking and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film put this series to bed and end it neven christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one nthe director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material but all he could come up with is plenty of slomo action some fastmotion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere nand is there anything spectacular about the swordplay or fight scenes nnope nand i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face closeups yipes nthe man is not aging gracefully is he noh boy and i havent even gotten around to the greatest piece of overacting that ive seen in years nthe man who plays kell in this movie bruce payne should get a ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near noveracting is not a hobby for this guy its na living nhes also very funny not purposely though nall in all the movie stinks nnuff said n
 my name is jack carter and you dont want to know me says our brooding antihero sylvester stallone ntake his advice nto know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace nand to watch this film is almost as painful n get carter is a gloomy looking unimaginative film that offers no joy njack carter is as tough as tough guys come nhe works out of vegas as a selfdescribed financial adjuster nexplaining his duties he says people make promises and break them ni help them remember nhe has a chiseled body full of tattoos nhe has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times nhe speaks in a hushed but menacing tone of voice nin other words this is sylvester stallone acting like sylvester nstallone nand like most of his previous roles his character is a shallow onedimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough hassle a few hapless people find out what he needs to know and then dispense his own kind of justice nwith the charisma of a pit bull being tough is all that jack carter knows nyet even tough guys know when to put family first nas the story begins we learn that jacks little brother has died in a car accident nthe police attribute it to heavy drinking nhowever jack is suspicious believing that he was taken out nhe takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth nas he pokes around he runs into several lowlife characters nthey include a shady business partner a prostitute a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates and an oily owner of a porn website nany one of them may know something about his brothers death nall of them have the means of carrying out the deed nbut dont expect an exercise in sleuthing where wellplaced clues lead carter to the truth nhes all brawn and no brains so there are no epiphanies during his investigation ninstead he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward cycling through this circle of suspects nflustered with his lack of progress he cycles through them again and again nthis all gets tiring fairly quickly nby the time the film launches into its final act were numb from its pedestrian pace noddly as a toughguy thriller it starves us for action nadmittedly there is one nifty chase sequence but this is related to a tangential and needless plot carters vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him nthe story also fails to generate any kind of emotion nstallone has the personality of a slab of stone nand the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast nthe weather is constantly overcast or rainy nmeanwhile most shots take place at night in dimly lit rooms or in dark alleys nits just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere nas a result get carter amounts to nothing more than a flat thriller bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement nyoure better off leaving this guy alone n
 easely one of the worst films of the year nwith the millenium just around the corner hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century nthis time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil nthe result is somewhat predictable ni didnt have high hopes about arnolds much anticipated return to the big screen nschwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased action lovers wont be bored and the catholic league will be angry neveryone else will see end of days for what it is a deliciously bad motion picture nthink of it as hollywoods own y2k bug ndid you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 youll get 999 as in 1999 nyes you better believe it satan is here on earth working on his latest project the end of days nthis time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and although not al pacino he is fun to behold nhe coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker wreaking as they say havoc nthe way it works is he smirks and something explodes nbefore the stroke of the new millennium hes got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations nonly schwarzeneggers cop attached to an antiterrorist unit can stop him nfilms like this has one serious weakness logic nno matter how you twist the plot youll find it incredibly stupid even for a schwartzenegger movie nthe incredible fact is that such directors never learn nafter thousands of headless productions this theme has become one big clich nhere the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution nhe is walking around n y blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius nall he wants is the girl that is somehow special nbut schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks he has hidden her in a church where satan dare not enter nso the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information you can have your wife and daughter back i ncan give you happiness that you can only dream of just ngive me the address nindeed with a script like that you could make a wonderful parody but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller nand for you who have awaited arnold swartzeneggers comeback will not be very satisfied nweve not seen him in a while nthats because he didnt have a worthy opponent nhe has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars nhe has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop nso after all those fights whats left for arnold schwarzenegger nhow about satan nin my opinion he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in camerons terminator nand that is schwartzeneggers strength muscles and no emotions nhere he tries to achieve an artistic level moving towards the oscar nthis is called an adult turn if successful and a flop if unsuccessful nmake a wild guess nhis character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems nthis requires at least some acting skills nregrettably the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles nthe rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters nthe movie is otherwise technically impressive with a solid cinematography and fine lighting nbut the movie doesnt serve neither as a serious thriller because of its stupidity nor as comic entertainment because of its serious tone nthe only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry nthe action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular nso i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody nunless you are a diehard schwartzenegger fan stay away nas for schwarzenegger hell be back n
a few months before the release of star wars episode 1 the phantom menace 20th century fox decides to release another space film that is a complete rip off of star wars nwhat is the point of this ni do not know but i wish it hadnt been done considering wing commander is definitely the years worst film so far nto attract people to this horrible movie they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace nwing commander will draw large crowds because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time nthe trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight nmany people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game ni found this very interesting considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie nit is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though nfreddie prinze jr stars in the film as christopher blair nwing commander was a huge mistake for freddie nthis was definitely his worst performance to date nafter januarys shes all that i actually saw a good actor in freddie but now all those visions have been crushed n for now anyway nchristopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi a group that is trying to destroy the earth nblairs parents also fought in the space battles and also died there nhis parents were pilgrims so many people disrespect him because of this nblair is under the command of angel played by saffron burrows and he is friends with another pilot todd maniac marshall played by matthew lillard nmatthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie and he does in this one too nhis character as stu in 1996s scream a was a great one but now it seems like that same role is being played again only in a space movie nthe three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth nthis plot is very flimsy and doesnt give a whole lot to work with at all nthis explains why wing commander drags on seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on nthe acting is horrible in wing commander nmany lines seem out of place and are completely meaningless nthe acting and dialogue was so terrible i even found myself laughing at it nthe other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music nthe special effects are very unrealistic nwhen looking at two ships flying side by side it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them nthe explosions look very unrealistic as well na ship will be blown up but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second nthis is very unrealistic nmusic pretty much accompanies the film the entire time nthe music also felt like video game music and it was very corny and annoying sounding nafter we are given the plot the film repeats itself for another hour without any plot twists interesting scenes or anything important to the film nblair is forced to make jumps over other planets and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft nfor the entire length of the movie it takes place in space nit is truly like you are in a video game because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long extended period of time nits not much fun to watch at all nif i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships i would go watch star wars at home nat least star wars pays attention to people myth feelings and has some real plot to it nthe bottom line bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox n

i dont appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting when in fact its ludicrous nin the case of the generals daughter the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point nbut at this juncture in the story the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie nthis predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of its detailed flaws nget past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent and youre likely to survive this entire movie ntravolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner whos working undercover at a military base when another situation arises the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer leslie stefanson nit turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell nlet the investigation begin nwith the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill played rather onthesidelines by madeleine stowe brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case nthings begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore james woods a former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve nwoods submits another scenestealing performance here as he oozes authority surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar nwith echoes of his supporting role in true crime in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges he makes every moment believable nhere though the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta as the two send mindful knowing glares across the room nthere are many scenes such as this in the generals daughter in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb ndirector simon west con air shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it nthe generals daughter is more often than not a predictable and unexciting mess nit does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless dragging its heels all the way at a mindnumbing snails pace na few brief action scenes marvelously handled in the editing department show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package nfrom a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts i suggest west should stick with mindless riproaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this nstill the movie is certainly not without its merits nthe acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast nthe performances range from commanding travolta to electric woods to stiffasaboard cromwell who doesnt show off his real talents here nmadeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while but as the female lead in an actionthriller she doesnt pull through sufficiently none of the problems with the execution is that its very predictable nfrom minute one i had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question nthe script even unwillingly points him out for us using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end nin all fairness weve seen many of the devices used in the generals daughter put to greater effect in other films nthe secrets behind the girls mysterious death are explained gradually but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly nthe generals daughter is not a terrible movie and it is involving enough to sustain a viewers attention span for a certain period of time nbut it just could have been so much better n
i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas nwith the overt success of the three original star wars films lucas has become not necessarily a filmmaker but the head cheeze at a huge toy company with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve nonly this toy was made for 115 million but every kid wants it and like all other expensive toys falls apart within an hour after playing with it nthe product in question star wars episode 1 the phantom menace jeez is pure and simple its about the money baby nno one in their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it wouldnt make a ton of money before its fourth week of release ni come to the sw franchise as a stranger since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular ni find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy nphantom menace is like the first sw minus 10 nnothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable neven the special effects seem rather bland nthe story in this new one is a mindless mess the nacting wooden and the action sequences like something out of a video game nsw phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far nwith a title like sw e1 tpm lucas has one big head on those shoulders ni thought chris carter did for releasing an xfiles movie although that movie adaptation was an excellent way to spend two hours npm is one long headache n
i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really indepth articles about some incident nthey will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail nit becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested and what kind of pressure the investigators are under and just about any other aspect you can think of nfrequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know noften i get to the middle of a story and say ok it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject nfilm is a different medium nit is a visual medium nthat slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize ni frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space nthe magazine article and the film script are two very different media nthe insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article the man who knew too much by marie brenner nit is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film nit really verges on being tedious at least at times nfor years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy sideeffects nbut they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it nthe business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco nthe tide turned when a former vicepresident of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking nthe resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs nwho were the major people involved what were their motives how was the story almost killed how did it get aired anyway nthat is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider nthis all could have been enthralling but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well nand in the end he failed nto make a long story short the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short nthe film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist nwe get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand nthey go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace played by christopher plummer nthere the news team under producer lowell bergman al pacino are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it nthis seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world nterrorists can grab the headlines but the tobacco companies have the real position of power nincongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand russell crowe dejectedly returning from work to his home nwe discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly nhe had been a very profitably rewarded vicepresident in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family nrather than support him his wife liane diane venora demands of him what are they supposed to do for income nmeanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand nthey offer wigand 12 000 just to interpret the data nwigands severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms nhe is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman nin spite of the secrecy wigands former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role nand so the game begins nwigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer nmeanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family nthe film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants nwigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out nhe and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight nal pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider nthe story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail nthe film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience nthe musical score by pieter bourke lisa gerrard and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory nit puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling nalso disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace nplummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too wellknown for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly nthis film might have been a really engaging experience under another directors control nmichael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style ni rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale n
this is your definitive hollywood movie extremely predictable following the basic formula a horrible ending overzealous writing meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wiseass character of which weve seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly wasnt used enough here im afraid the film would have been completely unbearable nin this film ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend nwhile in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her nover money how original nwhile in jail she works out exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition nnow she has learned about a law titled double jeopardy stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works nnow her po parole officer and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims nskipping over to the acting the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress no offense she has been good simon birch and even very good to great kiss the girls at times in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better nbut shes terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying doesnt really add to the movie at all just takes away nas id said jones was fine although he did not have much to work with nhe was much more of a supporting character nwhich is fine and he handled it well especially considering the material he had to work with ni feel this film had alot going for it noriginality not being an issue nthe acting was the only thing as i said keeping it alive nthe plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better nthe action scenes were well made however sometimes out of place ni was just left unsatisfied in the long run nso basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely overthought the plot has certainly been done before generally speaking the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones who if he had some more screentime could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating in my book anyway nkeep this in mind if youre in the mood for a good action film rent the fugitive nd n
first impressions critically a closetoawful film but moneywise it has been doing and will continue to do great na sometimesfunny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring nan orginal plot that grows old real fast none of the only 90 minute films that ive gotten bored through nmen in black has defied the odds nwhen i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas nhowever i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea which summer audiences have embraced that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie ntommy lee jones and will smith play two government agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society nthe ridiculous plot begins when an alien bug played weirdly by vincent donofrio who was so great in full metal jacket lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy thats somewhere on orions belt nanyway the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy or a higher power will blow up the earth nthe premise is ridulous but that is not why i didnt like this film ni love original plots nthis one had an original one nbut director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films nwhenever i saw donofrios bug stomp and eat people in the film it got terribly boring after a while nwhile smiths wisecracks did fill in the gaps it wasnt enough nand also i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a subplot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent they cant have contact with any humans really nand here i see jones at a satellite computer watching his lover plant the garden na sentimental moment in an alien movie nnice try but i dont think so nit doesnt work here nit just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring we dont only have aliens to worry about but now we have joness conscience ni came into the movie not wanting to see joness conscience but wanting to see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it nmaybe its unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were nnevertheless even though some parts are indeed funny the plot in this movie grew old and boring quick n
im going to start this review off with a hypothetical question nlets say youve just been in a car accident and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious nyour friends have left to go get help and youre waiting to see if the victim wakes up na towtruck comes along and the driver hops out of the truck to see whats going on nhe then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck ndo you na run away screaming for your life staying away from the main road nb run away but not too fast and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you stop to catch your breath try to negotiate with the psycho and when that fails start running away again all the while staying on the main road nif you answered a you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of texas chainsaw massacre the next generation and will likely hate this movie nhowever if you answered b prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind n texas chainsaw massacre the next generation is being called a sequel but its really more of a remake of the original ntheres a few changes here and there but its essentially the same even the infamous meathook scene has been recreated nthe story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere nneedless to say they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family nmuch carnage ensues nto call this movie inept would be putting it mildly nin addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere nit just swoops down and kills him with its wheel nno explantion is given as to who was flying it or why heshe is going around killing people with the planes wheel nthe dialogue is even more atrocious nzellwegger who is kidnapped by the family early on keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people nwhen youre surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses i would think that rationality would go out the window nspeaking of going out the window there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window napparently the stunt double had a little trouble because she visibly gets stuck in the window nthe director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double doesnt get caught in the window nthis was one of many glaring inconsistencies nthere are so many in fact that if i were to name them all this review would be several pages long nthe only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey nhe plays a member of the family with a hydraulic leg homemade i might add and is so completely overthetop you cant help but be amazed by his performance nhe obviously had a lot of fun with this part and it really shows nhe makes jack nicholsons portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in the shining look restrained in comparison nfor a horror movie texas chainsaw massacre the next generation contains surprisingly little gore nin fact in contains none ntheres a little blood here and there but thats as far as it goes nwhich leads me to believe that the budget must have been astonishingly low and it shows neverything about the movie looks cheap from the sets to the costumes nespecially leatherface nonce frightening and nightmare inducing hes now as terrifying as dame edna ndo yourself a favor and take a pass at this remake ncheck out the far superior original instead n
the happy bastards quick movie review ndamn that y2k bug nits got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother william this time in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on nlittle do they know the power within ngoing for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there virus still feels very empty like a movie going for all flash and no substance nwe dont know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere we dont know the origin of what took over the ship just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir and of course we dont know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout nhere its just hey lets chase these people around with some robots nthe acting is below average even from the likes of curtis nyoure more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 nsutherland is wasted and baldwin well hes acting like a baldwin of course nthe real star here are stan winstons robot design some schnazzy cgi and the occasional good gore shot like picking into someones brain nso if robots and body parts really turn you on heres your movie notherwise its pretty much a sunken ship of a movie n
im really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone nsure she is one of the most beautiful creatures on gods green earth second only to that movie critic at large guy but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in she always strikes out nthe crush was a slowmoving predictable piece of fluff nhideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in nclueless was an annoying unfunny waste of time nand people have emailed me too saying clueless is a good movie and that im the only one who doesnt like it none girl said if id seen the movie with an open mind i would have enjoyed it nnothing could be further from the truth ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie nthe preview looked good and of course im crazymadinlove with alicia but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny unlikable characters nalmost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way nwhen we were walking out of the theater one guy and it wasnt me yelled out that was the worst fin movie ive ever seen and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement nso last night i walked into the video store and saw alicias pretty face on the cover of some madeforvideo thriller called the babysitter ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion ill probably never understand made me rent it anyway nwhat i got was 90 minutes of regretthe worst alicia silverstone movie ever nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie nthe plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier the writing could have been done and for all we know it was by a ten year old alicia is the star and shes still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever nthere is zero humor zero suspense zero drama and zero action until the last ten minutes when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero nso why does this movie get one star out of me nwell alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub nand if it wasnt bubble bath the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four star features but you settle for what you can get nalicia plays a babysitter whos spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party nand of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home at least that movie critic at large guy does nas the movie trods along we discover shes not only the mostlysilent star of the movie but also the object of every male characters fantasies and probably every male viewers too nthe drunken father thinks shes just the thing to recapture his lost youth her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while shes taking her bubble bath nthey even throw in the middle aged wifes fantasies about a male counterpart at the party nnot that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200 pound woman in a black silk teddy nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pgrated nin fact i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax latenight staple if not for the fact that theres absolutely no nudity in it nso you cant call it a sex flick nive already pointed out that it cant fall under drama comedy thriller or action so what do you classify the babysitter as nbad n
lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient ngreat acting music and cinematography were nice but too many dull subplots and characters made the film hard to follow nralph fiennes strange days schindlers list gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy nthe story revolves around his past in flashback form making it even more confusing nanyway he is taken in by hana juliette binoche the horseman on the roof a boring wartorn nurse nshe was never really made into anything until she met an indian towards the end developing yet another subplot ncount almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger willem dafoe basquiat nhis love kirstin scott thomas mission impossible was severely injured in a plane crash and eventually died in a cave nhe returned to find her dead and was heartbroken nso he flew her dead body somewhere but was shot down from the ground ndont get the wrong idea it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting but good is the last thing this film is nmaybe if it were an hour less it may have been tolerable but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle nthe only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography nother than these the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film n n
joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory nthe strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it nit has a solid cast with tom hanks meg ryan as the lead roles nbut you can never judge a movie by its cast nif there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano it is that the plot is original nunfortunately it is also incredibly stupid nthe movie begins with joe tom hanks going to work nthis opening sequence is very boring and slow nit shows joe walking to his office nbut on the way he has to wait in a long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting na sequence like this should take 2 minutes nhere it takes over 5 nit is obvious that joe hates his job nat his office one of his coworkers is meg ryan noddly enough she plays 3 different roles in this movie njoe leaves to go to a doctors appointment nhis doctor informs him that he has a brain cloud nthis means that in a few months he will die nso what does joe do nquit his job of course nwhen he arrives home joe meets an old man named graynamore lloyd bridges ngraynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god nby a startling coincidence the boat trip to the island takes a few months nby the time he reaches the island he will almost be dead from the brain cloud anyway so joe agrees ngraynamore gives joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this great adventure njoe goes on a date with meg ryan his coworker nthe day before the boat trip joe meets one of graynamores daughters nshe is also surprise meg ryan nexcept she looks more hippyish nthey both have dinner and the next day joe gets driven over to his boat nthe lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamores daughters nand wonder of wonders she is also played by meg ryan nas they sail to the island meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have a craving for orange soda nafter some stupid talking scenes they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to nand that the brain cloud thing was made up nthey do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage njoe goes fishing and catches a hammerhead shark nthis is a cheap gag that has been pulled off many times nbut to top it off the shark is obviously rubber and fake none night there is a storm na cheaplooking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard nfortunately joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail nby pure luck they get to the island nsince the natives like orange soda they wear soda cans as attire nstupid or what n before joe leaps in the volcano he gets fed nright before he jumps meg ryan pleads him not to nwhen joe decides to she goes in with him because she loves him nnow this is where the movie should end nbut unfortunately the cheesy ending bug comes in nthe volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joes luggage nthey float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers ni give this movie a nsee it only if youre a film buff that enjoys a bad movie every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan n
the u s army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done none particular field manual is known as the fm 225 which among other things covers the practice of saluting nunder the saluting section is a subsection which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer nthe salute is rendered by the highestranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail nin any event the salute is rendered only by the man or woman in charge rather than by the whole group nalmost at the very beginning of the generals daughter we see a generals motorcade passing a work detail neveryone salutes nit looked impressive but it just wasnt right nthat little bit showed me that someone either didnt do the appropriate research or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene nin fact this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie nwhat results is a film that looks good but like that one scene just isnt right nthe first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example npaul brenner john travolta is an agent for the armys criminal investigation division undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale nprior to the transaction the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isnt the unscrupulous supply sergeant hes supposed to be and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living nso ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark well just say that it involves propellers nbrenner then receives new orders when the commanding generals daughter captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson is found naked bound and dead on one of the bases training ranges nhe is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder nwhat i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary nit gives no insight into brenner other than the fact that hes a little cocky ndoes the arms subplot turn up later nno so why add this extra running time to the film nthe answer it looked cool nor how about the atmosphere nthe beginning of the generals daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south thick trees dirt roads sultry colors over water all backed up with bayouesque music nnice immersion in the setting but it soon doesnt matter for when the films plot shifts over to the murder investigation so does the entire mood nno attention is paid to the location of the story and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme ndid the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ninstead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside nthe above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie nas ive already mentioned an entire section of the film doesnt jibe with the rest and the characterization only adds to the difficulty nbrenner who comes across as a man with little respect for authority suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell james cromwell and utters some of the corniest yes sir s ive ever heard nhe even delivers an emotioncharged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the generals daughter even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous nsunhill who initially comes across as a professional investigator utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information and even revels in her ingenuity nboth characters are protagonists but its hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place and in some cases simply unappealing ni could imagine that during filming west would shoot a scene then take the actors aside and tell them lets do it again but this time i want more ni say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good in this film they overact in most of their scenes nan even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the generals aide colonel fowler ni swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention na far cry from his days as linc in the mod squad i cant help but think he was acting from wests direction na couple of side characters including a west point psychologist john beasly and a young female private ariyan a johnson make their scenes nearly impossible to bear nthe only two actors who seem to have escaped wests influence are james woods who provides a good performance as colonel moore elisabeths mentor at the psychological operations unit and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police nwoods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with peoples minds and does so without ever taking it over the top nhutton just kind of hangs around but at least he wasnt overacting ni havent read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based but ill bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form nthe movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished nevery time were presented with some new aspect to the case west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like its the most momentous discovery ever but the information is not used by the investigators at all ninstead when conclusions are drawn they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts but lucky guesses instead nthe army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects then letting them guess who the killer was nwouldve been over in a half hour nthe film finishes with a sort of bookend featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning nliterally during the closing credits we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off nthey both seem kind of happy nmaybe they were driving away from simon west n
among multitude of erotic thrillers that had been released in the early 1990s woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty star of the bgrade action films of the previous decade nthose who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star nas director ginty did very little to improve that impression nthe protagonist of the movie is jack played by jeff fahey yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford played by bo derek nhowever she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby steven bauer none stormy night the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder nhowever his good friend walter j hill robert mitchum happens to be very good lawyer so jack might even prove his innocence in the end nbelonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots nunfortunately this film isnt comedy and any laugh is unintentional nthe characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them nthe actors that play them dont help either nthat is especially the case with jeff fahey whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison nhis partner bo derek on the other hand shows that she didnt age enough to cease being the sex goddess but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents nginty on the other hand tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer n
i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard nthe problem is i cant remember them as i write this review nthats not a good sign nin booty call jamie foxx is bunz a character whom i cant really describe because i dont know that much about him ni only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk and that he doesnt like relationships just booty calls at three in the morning no questions no commitment nbunz has a best friend named rushon tommy davidson who seems to be bunzs direct opposite on the straight and narrow and currently in a longterm commitment a whole seven weeks wow nrushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend nikki tamala jones but for a reason which is not totally explained its going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikkis friend lysterine vivica a fox who have never met nto make a long story short the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikkis obsession with safe sex nfirst she wants condoms so bunz and rushon go out and get them noh no they have to be latex not lambskin nback to the store nnow theyve got to get dental dams or therell be no foreplay nwhy are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand nnikki phones lysterine who lives across the hall and tells her shed better be making these demands too ntalk about coitus interruptus nbooty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those overthetop comedies nthe difference between the two is that in the latter things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality nin this category for example you have ace ventura private eye on the mild side and airplane nat the extreme nthere are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention nit is disappointing and even worse distracting nthere are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker are those real names ndoes not live up to its potential as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing nfor instance there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant nbunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese much to everyones surprise nhowever when asked how he learned the language he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from latenight kungfu films and soon gained mastery nthis negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene nif on the other hand when asked how he learned to speak chinese bunz simply replied with kungfu movies and then moved on the joke would have been much more effective nthis is because it would have been totally unbelievable but funny because we know it is unbelievable nby explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible the film is not giving its viewers enough credit nthe inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions nwhy are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends nwhy do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine nif nikki is so obsessed with safe sex why doesnt she have some condoms at her own apartment nthese questions are not answered by the screenplay but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward na very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language nsome movies use a lot of swear words but use them under very justifiable circumstances as when they are employed consistent with a characters pattern of speech nother films such as the recent jackie brown use them in ways that almost parody themselves nbooty call just sticks them in to get laughs and it doesnt work nthey stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them nhalf of the scenes seem to occur for no reason nthe chinese restaurant a holdup at a convenience store and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story and are in there for filler nthis is surprising considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long nits too bad that the core of the film isnt much better since it is comprised of sometimes funny but forgettable dialog ni refer you to the first paragraph of this review n
movies can do the two big es very well educate and entertain nin the best of all possible worlds they accomplish both non the red planet they fail entirely nin the near future a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth nthis film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be nafter some mumbojumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does nthe ground crew of people you couldnt care less about is trapped on the surface without food water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog nthe one potentially interesting character carrieanne moss spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer nattempting to graft 2001 esque space mysticism with terminator robot horror first time director antony hoffman cant seem to figure out whats going on nneither can we ndidnt he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was a coherent story ncouldnt he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter nthere are so many missteps nevery opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction nwhy introduce the theme of faith vs science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die offscreen nthe audience begins the film waiting for something to happen ntwo hours later theyre still waiting ndespite our greatest hopes there is no life on the red planet n
you know i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man nwhile watching instinct i couldnt help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the wellexplored themes of those earlier movies neven beside the tarzan comparison instinct just isnt a very good film nits painfully idealistic manipulative and silly ni didnt hate it its simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins furthermore most of the acting is quite good nbut i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved ni can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct and its pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams nthings start off in the predictable way as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero theo caulder cuba gooding jr an ambitious young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced old psychiatrist donald sutherland ncaulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life the one he thinks will make him famous nthe subject is ethan powell hopkins an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years npowell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa and its now caulders job to find out of hes mentally competent enough to stand trial nthrough a series of short sessions caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell neven though it really is an old man version of tarzan much of this central idea is rather interesting nas i said hopkins is captivating for every second hes on screen he has a way of convincing us that hes not acting that hes actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas nthe character himself isnt very interesting hes just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action ngooding jr does strong work opposite hopkins playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual nthe screenplay written by gerald di pego and suggested by a novel by daniel quinn gives us no background information on caulder but that seems to be the point he has no time for friends because hes obsessed with his work nnonetheless these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct nunfortunately filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting nturtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instincts artistic failure for they work together to make the dumbest most clicheridden environment in which their characters are to live and they do so by means of brainless subplots nfirst we have the prison warden subplot nthe prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulders progress at any cost if this means taking caulder off the powell case then thats fine ntheres also the prison guard subplot nthe prison guard is played by john ashton the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision and hes instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion nthen theres the daughter subplot in which maura tierney playing the daughter must look very upset a lot of the time after all she is the daughter of a deranged man nif some of this stuff sounds familiar thats because theyre all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films nthe evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here nthe offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoos nest had nashtons evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy browns in the shawshank redemption nhopkins performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs nand then theres the whole tarzan thing which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film nperhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the halfhearted attempt at philosophical depth nthe message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one he thinks that humans are takers that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas ni can sympathize with that but only when its in a compelling film nthis is the kind of stupid movie just like patch adams in which a big group of characters psychotic inmates in this case rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards nwhat does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas nif all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor we would have had a thirtyminute movie far superior to the twohour one that i watched today nif the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise then we would really have had something interesting a movie that doesnt rely on the strength of its actors n
when critics attack seemingly wellintentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry emails sometimes even mock death threats from those who i suppose like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment neven politicians ntend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on goodhearted films while praising filth like pulp fiction nthese fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with tend to forget that a film critics job is to review the movie not the message however sweet and endearing that message may be nthusly patch adams isnt a bad film because its about a doctor who cares for his patients its a bad film because its a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation nsimilarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place though i even doubt that stay tuned an explanation is forthcoming its still an unpleasantly maudlin mess nthe picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world n12 year old trevor haley joel osmet a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother helen hunt comes up with the notion to pay it forward this entails a person doing one good deed call it an uber favor for three others then telling them to do the same for three others and before long were all living in a frank capra movie nmeanwhile in a parallel story a weasely reporter jay mohr tracks the movement which has apparently begun to grow npay it forward has odd ideas about tone at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core nits as if director mimi leder didnt have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended and compromised out of fear that her film wasnt gutsy enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for nso the picture adds grit a child molester propositions trevor a homeless man returns to heroin after being saved a character is knifed while doing a good deed etc though it seems shallow incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isnt quite sure if its ready to buy into its own utopian blather npay it forward offers crowd pleasing elements for general audiences jay mohrs umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball angie dickinsons earthy alcoholic bag woman and the jivetalking black hoodlum with a heart of gold coming on the heals of the black godlike inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich nhurray for hollywood who actually calls the mohr character a nigga and says things like can you feel me nleave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment n maybe spikes flick wasnt so misguided after all nthese scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that youll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings nwhile the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience nits a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration with the main players all previous oscar winners or nominees given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns none scene in which a slightly deglamed helen hunt deglamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama hunts hair is also natty and badly bleached verbally castigates spacey feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip nspacey of course responds in his cultured monotone that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance nmaybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating though how can he not even when hes emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference nthe usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender nin one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke and with said hand still on said mouth she actually begins convulsing dry heaving really then and im not making this up she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol nthe scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blowups its all very theatrical especially hunts performance which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar npay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldnt get academy awards nthe picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists neven haley joel osemt the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections nhis acting has become broader less intimate its as if we can make out the little munchkins thoughts boy this outta floor em nnaturally osmet is made to play one of those onlyinthemovies children a martyrfigure who cleans up after his mother lectures her on the ills of drinking and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher nnever mind that the two couldnt be more dissimilar his mother is trailer trash dopey and the teacher is one of those dennis millerey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary nnevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trapish cornball antics nbut oh how we love bright articulate selfsacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life ntheyre so adorable nof course the blame cant all be hoisted onto the actors though with the exception of the little kid they probably should have known better instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er then went on to make two awful genre films in a row nthe first being the peacemaker a witless postcold war george clooney vehicle and deep impact one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earths possible demise by a crazed meteorite nthe first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich s and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out apparently present for an invisible audience ndeep impact has more in common with pay it forward its a movie that treats earths impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days nthe film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching nin pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal see my movie isnt as na ve as you might think she seems to be saying nno its just horribly confused n
when the haunting arrived in theaters all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects nwhile i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department i dont think that they are completely to blame for this movies failure nit appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the unseen terrors and it was about as scary as a dust bunny nso special effects or not if the story isnt the least bit scary you arent going to end up with a very frightening movie nthe thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern ndern is always great and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie nas i sat through the seemingly endless albeit fairly impressive special effects i kept wishing that this movie was about derns caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast nnever a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie nliam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear nhe decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion nhe tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia nand he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goingson ncatherine zetajones lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects nlike the original taylors character is the star of the movie nbut since she doesnt quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms zetajones their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original nand lets face it probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zetajones nill admit that i would have never seen this thing if she werent in it nbut the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets nthey take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients nthere really isnt much of a story here njust endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with nand the special effects are great nin many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere nin other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the cool shots quota nat no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary funny maybe nbut not scary nthen we have the set nwhen i first saw the house i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it nbut it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did and decided to take the idiotically overdone route nthis included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves nwhat part did these rooms play in the story nabsolutely none nthey were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie nthen we have the actors nlili taylor has never been one of my favorites nand when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in she comes in around the average or slightly below mark ni have no idea why liam neeson took this role nhe basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus nhis character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him ni have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman nzetajones was cast because she is too hot for words nthe fact that her character is bisexual is just icing on the cake nall catherine has to do in this movie is look good nfortunately that is something she does very well nwhile she does have a fairly good size part it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eyecandy nits too bad someone of her talents wasted them here nany random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role nthe haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999s horror movies the blair witch project nthe haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares nboth prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film nif the story sucks its all downhill from there nmy advice nif you are looking for special effects go rent star wars nif its scares you want rent halloween neither way its probably in your best interests to skip the haunting n
of course i knew this going in nwhy is it that whenever a tvstar makes a movie its always a romantic comedy and then they say on entertainment tonight or something that they were attracted to the characters nthey were really original noriginal let me give you a runthrough of picture perfect character a kate jennifer aniston from tvs friends a smart beautiful professional woman wants two things she cant have a new jobtitle and the love of her coworker kevin bacon nher boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls nwhat does she do nshe invents a fiance nthen when everyone wants to meet him she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him 1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner and pick a fight with her at the end thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor defenceless female nhe of course goes along with it ngee i wonder if they get together in the end nive seen more original stuff on the wb nand better stuff too npicture perfect also makes the mistake of being wayyyyy too long at 100 minutes and expecting us to like anistons character who comes off as a cold spoiled bitch n

i never understood what the clich hell on earth truly meant until very recently nive just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying so horrible so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as hell on earth nafter all ive never been to war ive never been the victim of any violent crime ive never really been broken hearted and ive never been audited so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was hell on earth nthen i saw cruel intentions nin a perfect world i would be in charge of all the movie studios nthe very first thing id do in this perfect world would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv and throw them in jail nbut it wouldnt just be your average jail not even a maximum security installation nid have these producers and everyone else involved in the production of these films put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity nnow youre probably thinking to yourself is this really how bad cruel intentions is nthe answer is no nits actually much worse nwatching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumbles awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound nand then pouring acid on the salt ni dont know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum tara reid whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom nfrom that opening scene where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz to the conclusion which i dont remember because i had practically fallen asleep cruel intentions is truly hell on earth right up there with war and tax audits n
vikings v bears nno this isnt the lineup for monday night football nrather these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in the 13th warrior a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory nbased on michael crichtons book eaters of the dead this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought ntheir strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword nluckily for the vikings however their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film nantonio bandaras is ahmed a travelling ambassador naccompanied by his friend omar shariff in a cameo they eventually come across a small viking village nwe see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude nthey laugh heartily revel in their arrogance and sing songs of battles won nbut their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land nhelp is needed quickly nan elderly fortunetelling witch arrives nafter a brief incantation she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more not of norse blood are needed to ensure victory npersonally i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity nnonetheless 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th nthe group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives nof course during their ride ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors nbut he ably shows that its not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog nhe is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings but will his skills and that of the group be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside nit does not look promising nthese creatures resembling bears are strong and have high morale nthey are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies nthey attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon nthe warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods nthey are ready to sacrifice their lives n this is a good way to die says one of the fallen warriors ndespite the largerthanlife battle sequences i was unmoved by the entire experience nat many points i was even confused nfor example somewhere in the middle of the film a subplot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land nhe seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis nhowever the subplot never fully materializes and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion nthere are other questions that i had but the real problem was that the story little of it that there was offered no characters to love or hate nthe leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma nhowever banderass role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special nan entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order nalso much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night which made battles very difficult to follow ni would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy nas it stands the film manages more confusion than intensity nit would make thor cry n

disconnect the phone line ndont accept the charges ndo anything you can to avoid the wretched melodramatic sisterhood dramedy hanging up ni figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side and hanging up seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so nthe film features an incredible palate of female talent and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as sleepless in seattle and unsung heroes nmeg ryan diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who once separated by career judgments over family ties must reunite when their father walter matthau is admitted into the hospital with alzheimers disease nwhile this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery nhanging up has the overall effect of a telemarketer pestering you for two hours while you dont have the option of doing as the title suggests nfor the first halfhour the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development nthis is an annoying and ineffective device ncellphones ring every five minutes and everyone hurriedly rushes along leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters issues and problems nif hanging up was an apple pie then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story ngranted there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film nbut they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck nthe most outrageous strategy in hanging up is that after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale nwe are able to identify with eve ryan the most open and caring daughter because she is the one who stayed by her fathers side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career ngeorgia keaton the eldest daughter is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called ngeorgia nmaddy kudrow the soap opera actress spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog nryans convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of hanging up nkudrow so delightfully eccentric as the offkilter airhead phoebe in friends is totally wasted nditto for keaton who is serving a double shift as costar and director a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle nher frenzy is apparent nfor a chick flick there is a distressing lack of chuckles nthe reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that given his characters situation seems more depressing than amusing neven so the peak form of humor in hanging up is represented by some of matthaus nasty quips and ryans eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill nthat about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film nmy curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and starstudded approach could turn so viciously sour nbut really its no mystery nthe predictable melodramatic filth that is hanging up is certainly not the fault of these actresses npin it on the screenplay which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations nits certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience but hanging up should have at least been enjoyable nuhuh nits a wrong number from the beginning n

where do i begin nokay how about with this starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time nin fact it might even be the worst major release film to come out in years nor even a decade nthis is bad beyond belief ni would not suggest paying money to see this ntheres a good chance youll regret it nif you see it for free you could still want to walk out ngo right ahead nthe movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of buenos aires nhere we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious easyto despise withapassion characters that have love triangles love rectangles and love hexagons screwing up their life nbefore long they all go off and join the military primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined nthey train nthey strut around nude for no reason whatsoever nafter an hour of making the audience scream in agony they start fighting bugs nthe big bugs look nice even though their design is only okay nunfortunately the fights are boring since we want all of the characters dead anyway ncue more agony nthen some characters have sex nthen some more die n who cares ncue more agony nthe movie ends the audience runs out to their cars vomits over the pavement and attempts to drive home nunfortunately after that torture they cant think straight dont pay attention to the road and many are in ugly car wrecks nyou remember how batman robin was bad nwell batman robin kicked this movies sorry butt people nstarship troopers does not succeed as an action movie nit does not succeed as a drama nit does not succeed as a war movie nit does not succeed as a comedy nit does not succeed as a satire nit does not succeed as a parody nit succeeds as being horrible nterrible ngutwrenchingly bad ni wanted to run away from that movie every minute nbut i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better nso i stayed nit never got better nfrequently it did the impossible and got worse nthe movie as written acted directed and basically just feels as a whole like its about on the mental maturity level of a free willy 4 the whole thing feels like a movie that only threeyearolds could enjoy nexcept for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore and pointless nudity nits written for little children but children should definitely not go anywhere near it nof course i recommend the same for everyone ndont go anywhere near it nverhoevens got a streak going now nhis last movie was showgirls nhe seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming nshowgirls was a failure but it appears that though itll be lucky to make near its budget this movie will still do okay grosswise nis it really all bad nwell no ntroopers has about four or five lines of dialougeshort humorous scenes that are actually funny mostly from the do you want to know more ncommercials that pop up throughout the story promoting the joys of the joining the troopers nso that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment and still about one hour 59 minutes and 30 seconds of miserable torture nim totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie nbut i do admit it nso if youre willing to possibly put yourself through torture go ahead and see it and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it ni dont know how anyone or any thing could love this movie but hey to each his own nfeel free to give it a shot nof course in the interest of saving your souls i dont recommend it nbut guess what nalien resurrection comes out november 26th and having already seen some of it and having read the script i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away nthough opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split itll be difficult to find someone that wont like alien resurrection when theyve seen it nthis is possibly the years best intense action film or at least one of the best nif you really want to see alien warfare thats played out intelligently and seriously see alien resurrection nplease avoid this n
i have no real tangible proof of this but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director then it is actually possible to make a good movie nusing their logic all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of superfamous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget nthis is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre nnow before i continue to ferociously attack whats wrong with this film i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller ncatherine zetajones plays virginia baker an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal sean connery nif youve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before i really dont have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details the two team up for various jobs stealing various things for various purposes nthe problem we come to is that weve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesnt break any new ground in the bigbudgethollywoodaction genre nthe result is that the entire production feels contrived nim going to be completely honest here pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the runtime was looking at catherine zetajones nnow while this may be a compliment for ms zetajones it certainly isnt for either the writers or the director who are not nearly as clever as they think they are njust about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between entrapment and blackmail nwith an eighty million dollar budget youd think that entrapment would at least feature edgeofyour seat action scenes or breathtaking special fx nwell youd be wrong nthe action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular nunfortunately for all those involved with entrapment die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by 11 years nthe reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture you know exactly whats going to happen despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists nmany scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zetajones in extremely tightfitting clothing none particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laserbeams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask nnothing wrong with that but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was so why didnt she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room nill tell you why because its a great excuse to photograph zetajones posterior as it slides underneath those beams and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing the rehearsal nving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie and though he has great screen presence although so do connery and zetajones and the most interesting character in the film not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss a concept i invented just to describe this picture none last complaint entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot hell spontaneously disappear in ninjalike fashion ni can picture amiel patting himself on the back thinking to himself itll leave the audience wondering for days how did he do that nwe know jon its called editing n

i have never been a star trek fan and to tell the truth out of the five films in the series that i have seen 1 2 3 8 9 i have disliked all of them ni do however always go into one of these with an open mind and the ninth film in the series star trek insurrection is no exception ndropping almost completely the hardcore scifi element of the previous one in the series first contact insurrection tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people known as the baku as well as the fountain of youth nat the start of the picture the villagers go under attack by a second alien species known as the sona who want to push all of the baku out so that their own race will not die out nalso attacking the baku is data brent spiner a robot from the star trek enterprise nafter returning to jeanluc picard patrick stewart and the gang on their space ship no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force nso several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the baku where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants a sultry kind alien woman donna murphy who is over sixhundredyearsold but looks to only be in her thirties n star trek insurrection is a completely unoriginal and cheaplooking installment in the series and is a big step down from 1996s first contact which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different nin insurrection however it plays like a lowrent episode of the television show due to the smallscale generic storyline and an emphasis on oneliners rather than excitement nthe film was filled with nearly nonstop comedy and worse yet most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff nmeanwhile when there were action sequences they were not at all interesting or inventive relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very very slowly nthis plot device which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays is getting old fast nare filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax nanother element of star trek films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later nalthough donna murphy who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103minute running time alfre woodard was far superior in first contact nshe should have returned for this one but i dont blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movies disappointing and often lifeless screenplay by michael piller n star trek insurrection is perhaps the weakest film in the star trek series although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst star trek v the final frontier n insurrection is the type of safe sequel that will bewilder nonfans since it is so lowtech compared to most of todays blockbuster action films although most of these are honestly not very good either and should disappoint the loyal trekkies since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts non second thought they probably should have completely thrown the script out nthat way they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness n
with his successful books and movies michael crichton is doing well nwith early successes with westworld 1973 and coma 1978 and recent films such as jurassic park 1993 his films have been entertaining nhowever he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere nthis 100 million mess by good director barry levison disclosure is dull long winded and a huge disappointment nconsidering the huge budget the all star cast and a story by crichton sphere is majorly disappointing nthe film opens with norman goodman hoffman a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors nhowever when he arrives he his told by supervisor barnes peter coyote that he is actually investigating an spacecraft nalong with goodman is mathematician harry adams jackson biologist beth halperin stone and ted fielding liev schrieber nthey investigate the spaceship find a massive sphere inside meet an alien intelligence called jerry and basically weird crap happens nunfortunately something went wrong along the way with sphere nthe film starts off entertaining enough but throughout this very long movie it just gets sillier and sillier nthe film jaunts along from scene to scene never fully explaining what is going on nthe actors and directing dont help either nhoffman is on autopilot and almost seems embarrassed throughout the movie churning out dull lines and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie nstone is useless displaying no emotion and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman nthe only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson whos funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere nbut hes hardly in it and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone nthe same goes for peter coyote who hams it up as the officer but is then killed off halfway through nthe director barry levinson who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure 1994 messes up with the drama and the action nthe drama scenes are quite frankly boring and the action scenes suffer from overkill with levison throwing the camera all over the place much like the godawful speed 2 1997 nthe writing doesnt help much either nalthough crichton is great with plots hes terrible with dialogue and practically every line in sphere is a dud nthe speech is too simple i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent npractically every line is just stating the obvious nnone of it is smart nalso where the hell did the budget go nthe sphere itself is impressive and theres a few nice special effect shots but where the 100 million went is anyones guess ntheres a giant squid attack in the picture but not once does the audience see the squid even though the film has a massive budget ni assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid and if handled correctly it probably would nbut the whole scene is done badly and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid nfinally the film has no idea what genre to be nlevison cant handle his own plot nit leaps from hokey scifi to horror and finally the shiningevent horizon psychological thriller nand of course the film is very much like the abyss 1988 although in its defense crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released and is far superior to this rubbish nits not all that bad though nthe plot is all right theres a few jump scenes although nothing very scary and theres the occasionally interesting bit nbut overall sphere is a big waste of some fine talent a lot of money and a potentially good movie nnot really worth seeing noverall rating review by david wilcock n
after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy i was ready for some mindless funoh maybe something like tango cash nmaybe not nmindless fun is one thing but braindead slop is another matter altogether ntango cash has lowest common denominator written all over it nthe movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l a russell plays cash a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts nstallone plays tango a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it he doesnt need the money nin an effort to change his image stallone goes for a yuppie gq look in the film wearing spectacles and three piece suits nthe two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names ntango cash is unbearably noisy nfor starters theres harold faltermeyers annoying synthesized score which gets old after four notes nto make matters worse the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars the more the merrier nin fact the movie begins with not one but two car chases ntheres nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie nscreenwriter randy feldmans brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv nhis shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it such as stallones efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual nin a movie with the iq level of an amoeba even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligentand stallone is no lawrence olivier nits hard to imagine anyone reading feldmans script and thinking i want to be in this movie nthe films plot doesnt have one original bone in its body andagainyou have to point your finger at the screenwriting nfeldmans story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book making tango cash altogether generic and predictable nthey simply could have called it action movie nevery character every twist and turn is stolen from television or from other movies nadding insult to injury tango cash is about as believable as a road runner cartoon naction movies dont have to be realistic but they should absorb you enough so that youre not thinking about the lack of realism nthe only artistic aspect of tango cash is the cinematography nthere are some spectacular shots especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires nthe films main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell nunfortunately their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants nthe dialogue consists of nothing but oneliners and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing nits a shame because with a workable screenplay russell and stallone could have turned tango cash into a charming lethal weaponesque adventure ntango cash tries to maintain a light tone and you do laugh about once every five minutes nseeing russell in drag is the movies funniest moment but you probably already have seen it in the commercials nfurthermore the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence nmachine guns and torture generally dont mix well with comedy njack palance appears in tango cash doing what he does best playing a sleazy conniving villain nhis character however is runofthemill except for his strange obsession with mice nlike many movie villains palance likes to play games nin fact he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room nyou have to wonder why palance doesnt just shoot the detectives in the head nthe story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent nteri hatcher plays stallones sister and russells loveinterest and she is just as pretty as can be nbut regrettably hatchers acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty nevery time she opens her mouth you cringe corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination ntheres really very little if anything to recommend in the film nand more to the point tango definitely isnt worth a penny of your cashso dont bother n

at first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer but that was before i saw the film nnow my view has completely changed nits time to embrace for impact because this is a very bumpy ride nthe story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including jason nesmith tim allen alexander dane alan rickman gwen demarco sigourney weaver signing autographs at a convention nthey meet fans who dress up in costumes fans who worship the ground they walk on and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris robin sachs nof course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties and meet the ugly aliens themselves nthus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians nthe movie plays like a really bad star trek episode in fact its worse ni dont even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof because quite frankly its just not funny nall the jokes are basically collected observations from the series none such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space because no extra on the tv show ever lives as proven in the star trek series ncreative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea but not when they are used to death na person can only take so much nwe do not need to be tortured especially when you have to pay for it nits pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful nits not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him but a few laughs would have been helpful nspeaking of acting 2 fine talents were wasted as well nsigourney weaver was here to show cleavage well at least it worked nits pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage nit just shows you how disgraceful the film really is nalan rickman however was not so lucky nafter his last hit dogma he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess nits just a shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away nwhen the film couldnt get any worse thankfully some nice special effects pop up nlike many big blockbusters armageddon the haunting to name a few they rely heavily on effects to help boost the films box office results ntimes it works but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk nwhen will it stop ni am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash nit may look fine and dandy but we need to at least have a story nis that too much to ask nobviously it is nwhen galaxy quest finally ends it literally crash lands naside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic its an embarrassment to the cast and its embarrassing to the science fiction genre nits not the least bit fun nor was it entertaining nthe only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond n
a backdrop of new years eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a great party movie nthe decor possibilities are endless disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic big hair was worth its weight in aquanet and the louder the fashion the better the look nbut despite this setting these details and a soundtrack that includes some 40plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade something is inherently wrong with 200 cigarettes na better title for this nostalgic mess would be 50 missed opportunities nwhat is it that makes this retrocomedy such a downer nits certainly not the cast which includes enough hot young talent for several movies ntheres courtney love cementing her reputation as a serious actress christina ricci hot off her shouldabeennominated turn in the opposite of sex paul rudd who gets even more appealing with every role kate hudson inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn and affleck brothers ben and casey two of the best things about good will hunting nperhaps the question is this what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project nmaybe it looked good on paper n 200 cigarettes is composed of a series of vignettes as various characters make their way through new yorks festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica martha plimpton all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper namong the potential guests are likeable cad kevin rudd and his best friend lucy love busy bickering over his recent breakup and a clumsy but seemingly charming bartender ben affleck who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pickup lines nmore subplots many more dot the big picture but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light nall the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubicks cube nricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants out to have a high time in the big city ninfamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a severalscene cameo nhudson as a prettyinpink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies man jay mohr trips pukes and gets smeared with dog poop nare we laughing yet nthe film boils down to a mixture of the good the bad and the gaudy with the latter two overtaking the former ngame performances especially by love rudd and plimpton are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle ntoo many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other nif this is 200 cigarettes then get me 200 nicotine patches n
heres something to chew on whats the favorite food of big cheesylooking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising nthe obvious answer to this question is cardboard because thats the depth of the most fully developed character in this painfully generic creature feature ndeep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer nin fact considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas perhaps it was nthe most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore nnot since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh both human and nonhuman been scattered in all directions nwe learn some bloody trivia as well such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains and what it does with halfdigested leftovers ni suppose deep risings gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre but it doesnt do much for me non the surface and thats about the only level at which this film can be analyzed deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic everyone else is citing the equally valid alienstitanic connection since james cameron directed both nin going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongueincheek mayhem of tremors deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin nthe film is not humorous tense or exciting nin fact its downright boring and despite being half the length of camerons current boxoffice champ deep rising feels like the longer movie nis it really necessary to say anything about the plot nprobably not since its easy to guess but ill go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis nthe film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship nin addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics theres finnegan treat williams the boats pilot whos supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff joey kevin j oconnor the inept sidekick whos supposed to be lovable and funny but is really just irritating and hanover wes studi the mastermind and i use that term lightly of the operation ntheir goal attack a cruise ship clean out the safe then sink it using some illegallyacquired torpedoes nthe problem is by the time they reach the argonautica the titaniclike luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste naside from a beautiful jewel thief famke janssen and a couple of crew members theres no one on board nthe reason soon becomes obvious the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles nthe cast which is led by treat williams is primarily comprised of hasbeens and probablyneverwillbes two exceptions wes studi best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans and djimon hounsou amistads cinque nwilliams once a cant miss prospect in hollywood has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career nfamke janssen who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye is the perfect bland match for williams ngiven her limited acting abilities its likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes nunfortunately a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet teeshirt for half of the picture nmeanwhile kevin j oconnor who has entirely too much screen time exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard nthese days audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computergenerated special effects nthis is a lesson that writerdirector stephen sommers who previously helmed the liveaction jungle book needs to learn nthe days of jurassic park when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen are past nnow moviegoers are looking for the sophistication of titanic visuals that are so wellincorporated that its impossible to tell where they end and where reality begins nin deep rising the monster like everything is artificial and unconvincing nunfortunately the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isnt so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre although to be fair deep rising is a particularly bad entry neven once this film has sunk out of sight the knowledgeable viewer knows it wont be the last of its kind nlike the slimy slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies more are waiting just around the corner in ambush nand that consideration unlike anything on screen is truly horrifying n

as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding especially three times nbut alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber nits amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything nthe whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful nthis is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor nwell this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded nalong the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber nthankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience nthe flubber is supposed to be flying rubber but it seems to have a life of its own nthis is there strictly for the kids nthe properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs nalthough amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone nthe poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at get his fiancee back finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire and do all this in the funniest way possible nadmittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original the absent minded professor nthe whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable nthe basketball players stereotypically unqualified for the sport somehow manage to bounce fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning nthis just sounds too bad to be true the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance nas for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie ngiving life to the flubber which is so poorly executed that its best forgotten and prof brainards flying robot weebo ngiving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasnt for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie nthe life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well but it wasnt and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good nnow weebo is a totally different story nits a robot that prof brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too nthis is a really original idea well maybe not but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie nyes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters nthe film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all nthe acting by robin williams prof nbrainard seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced nmost of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12 npeople when stood up at the altar dont usually give third chances nor for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards but what can be expected this is a childrens movie nflubber as a movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect nwith the best character in the movie being something of a prop i doubt that many people will find it all that great nit does have its amusing moments and it is a good story in the end but it does not wash up to the original nkids should find this movie amusing and fun and theyll probably enjoy the whole movie nas a movie its just a kids movie and not the best of ones at that n
deadbang an action thriller starring don johnson lives up to its dumb title or at least to half of it nalthough deadbang is definitely dead it is anything but a bang in fact they should have called this one dead bore nin the film johnson plays nyou guessed it na cop nthe role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character jerry beck is a gritty los angeles homicide detective a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on miami vice na la mel gibson in lethal weapon beck is an emotional wreck complete with violent outbursts unscrupulous police methods and a bleak outlook on life nbecks wife has just divorced him and she is cutting him off from their children nshe will not even allow him to wish them merry christmas by telephone nbut becks family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in deadbang nbeck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop nhis investigation starts in l a and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp nvirtually every aspect of deadbang is inept and ineffective nthe plot is incoherent and full of holes nthe movie depicts becks investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions nthe action sequences in deadbang are strictly thirdrate and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense ni certainly expected more from longtime director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller the manchurian candidateas well as black sunday seven days in may and the french connection ii nin all fairness to frankenheimer however i should note that most of deadbangs shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction ndeadbang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting naccording to the movies production notes deadbang is based on the reallife experiences of stillactive detective jerry beck nyou would never guess this from watching deadbang however since the film totally lacks credibility it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable nmost of the characters in deadbang are either atrociously acted underdeveloped superfluous or all of the above nwilliam forsythe for example is painfully bad as arthur kressler a wholesome bythebook fbi agent whos offended by becks foul language and unorthodox methods nforsythes lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable ndeadbang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid wkrp in cincinnati and franks place but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains nthe sole function of penelope ann millers character is to give deadbang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less ni guess the films title refers to this love scene since its definitely a dead bang nthe only real virtue of deadbang believe it or not is don johnson who tries to overcome the limitations of the movies pitiful script njohnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life nand i must admit that deadbang does have one or two amusing moments nthe funniest scene has johnson throwingup all over a criminal as he interrogates him nbut when barf is the highlight of a movie you know the movies in trouble nthe other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck in which he cant keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen nbut two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make n
the classic story the production which ruined it nmarking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h g wells classic new line cinema armed with a stellar cast and expert makeup effects man stan winston alien predator terminator etc churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel nof course the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 under the title the island of lost souls sounds like a much better title nthe story begins with edward douglas thewlis a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery kilmer after his plane crashes into the sea ndouglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr moreau who incidently owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize nhis hosts reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreaus lab when a monstrous birth was in progress neven worse the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal people ndouglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beastpeople community which considers dr moreau their maker nusing shocktherapy and the law dr moreau has long been able to keep his beastpeople civilised to some extent but there are a few animalmen who are just too savage to be controlled nthe island of dr nmoreau questions the ability of men playing god ndr moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long nmoreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp neven so the production has failed to make the most out of it nthere are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is the characters are not prioritized so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important before they know it he or she or it perishes rather nungloriously at times too nperhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people especially aissa balk the most human of moreaus creations nthe two very important characters montgomery and dr moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably nmore screen time could have been used for character interaction and development ni really would have liked it better if say they delved more into dr moreaus obsession montgomerys purpose in the story and justification to as why the beastpeople had to rebel nmaybe the nature of the screenplay which incidently does not incorporate much action sequences in the film forced the filmmakers to cut a long story short and make it more of an action film than anything else its still summer and movies have to be marketable nthe special effects too are really nothing for anyone to shout about nat most i would say the beastmen looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes nthis h g wells classic really has potential to be a good film nunfortunately after 2 adaptations they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story nas a third outing the island of dr moreau naccomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of the planet of the apes nthe flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast n a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha n pretty good bring a friend n amazing potent stuff n perfection nsee it twice n
synopsis two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry woody harrelson an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye has illtimed fits of coughing and fails at everything he does nthe story is told from harrys point of view nharry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesnt drink none day harry is approached by the con girl rhea elisabeth shue who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesnt smoke nseduced harry agrees to participate in a moneymaking scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette chloe sevigny the teenage daughter of a rich man nturns out its all part of a needless very puzzling extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme it involves hiring special impersonators by two cons in order to fool harry a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post nwhen the kidnapped odette is found dead the clues point to harry as the kidnappermurderer and the police are hot on harrys trail nharry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money ncan he get out of this mess nopinion palmetto is a long uninteresting film with all the wrong feel nhero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence nthis farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof nbut palmetto is played like a dark serious detective noir drama and watching harrys bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction ntheres a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts buttocks short skirts colored painted nails and womens legs neven when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema you can always notice the side of elizabeth shues breast forming a prominent foreground ntowards the end palmetto refocuses on plot for the grand finale a confusing explanation involving impersonators with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals confession nif you can imagine shemp from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo lingerie suspense thriller thats how out of synch this movie feels n
i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series nif theres a will theres a way and i believe that anything no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon nthis is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sants universally panned update of psycho i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience but also very onpar with an original nbut i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad nyou see the point of a remake is or at least it should be to iron out the originals flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection nbut what if the source material on which the remake is based isnt any good to begin with nthat is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad nive only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which it is based and to be honest i didnt like it all that much nit has a concept that and still is interesting a group of corrupt young adults all in their early 20s are given a choice they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed or they can become undercover cops helping the police get into places that they normally wouldnt be able to access nobviously all 3 opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen and policewomen nthe three main characters here are played by claire danes omar epps and giovanni ribisi nof the three only danes has a real character nribisis dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs epps slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes nwhen the squads superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death the three of them sure that their beloved master was framed go off and investigate on their own discovering corrupt cops lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations nall kinds of good stuff nthe only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments nalthough ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie his man here is really rather amusing when the script gives him a chance nepps straight man is effectively played against ribisis clueless spontaneity nbut the rest of the film is dull boring and singularly uninteresting na drugop action plot is no longer anything new not even with teenage action heroes and the way its executed here its also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful nclaire danes character has potential but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained nshe could have been a tourdeforce but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role nepps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected although their characters arent nearly as rich as danes could have been nthe mod squad is a mindnumbing marketing plot of a film and teens will jump all over it nits full of bad dialogue scenes and concepts that make no sense and get this drug dealers that like to tango with other guys in their spare time nnothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for nclaire danes is no longer alluring mainly because shes got a horrible hairdo so that draw is out nthere are however cool explosions guns and chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort ndo not be fooled nsome may call this escapist fare i call it escapeasquicklyasyoucan fare n

note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned nat the end of the day those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere nthis highlyanticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening where it would have gone headtohead against the rival studios heavy hitters its eventual demotion to a less potent midaugust opening was an obvious early indication of the studios lack of confidence with the picture nand with good reason nthis is a joyless exercise of a film held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement thrills or wit nremarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last years case study in style over substance joel schumachers muchloathed batman robin n indeed both films even feature appalling ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes numa thurman who takes on the salacious role of the catsuitclad karatechopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage nunfortunately the same cant be said here where she and cohort ralph fiennes our new john steed taking over for patrick macnee demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade doubleentendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that theyre on board a sinking ship nat this rate usuallysplendid actor mr fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettablyneglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days nthe duo look the part and admittedly the avengers is more than most heavily dependent upon style but theyre no fun to watch and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the pictures caperesque plot nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs peel no not kate beckinsale although the notion now intrigues me but gwyneth paltrow who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spoton english accent nif nothing else itd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt nthe story such as it is involves the everbemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter sean connery an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climatecontrolling contraption n they also sip a lot of tea noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists superiors it sounds far better than it plays and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant postproduction tinkering its clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds nthe avengers was never about gripping drama and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac its all decidedly uncompelling nmr connery whos onscreen barely long enough to register an impression approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest nat least it all looks good nthis is a genuinely handsome production with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt nin particular the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain nthere are a handful of striking visual moments in the film including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates nby the time the films climax had arrived my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain but with the quickest escape route from the theatre nnot coincidentally the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movies remarkable trailer a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year nits everything that the avengers is not saucy clever engaging and entertaining na crushing disappointment the film is one of the worst outings of the year too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad too polished to overlook its deficiencies nthere may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers but i sure hope not n
burnt money is the perfect festival film nit will show once or twice and then no one thankfully will ever have to hear from it again nthis film from the seattle international film festival 2001s emerging masters series is easily one of the years worst nbilled as a gay bonnie and clyde this gritty film from director marcelo pi eyro has its only highlight in a welldesigned title sequence ntwo gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader whose plan they screwed up angry nthis causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys one of whom may not actually be gay nhiding out in a prostitutes apartment the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movies conclusion nif caught they risk losing all the money and their love nas an added emotional bonus one of the gay men is dying nor something like that neverything that happens is so quick and confusing i was completely lost nclarity isnt exactly this movies striving virtue so it was a little hard to pick up nnot much could have really happened though nthe main events in this long twohour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex graphic drug use extreme violence and strong language nlots of explicit material is never a bad thing when theres a reason but theres no purpose to anything in this film nmost of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing nit appears pi eyro who cowrote with marcelo figueras from a novel by ricardo piglia purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement nhe makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible makes them snort cocaine gives them guns and condoms and lets them go nburnt money is pointless nthe performances are bad nit tries to thrill and shock but only causes boredom ngod forbid it will ever get a distributor nanother disappointing film from this years socalled emerging masters series npass on by n

would you believe in real life i mean that if you were julia roberts that youd be the ugly underdog to your sister the creepy catherine zetajones nlet me tell you what reality is nreality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot nthats reality namericas sweethearts is the opposite of reality a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy alsoran presumably because she wears hornrimmed glasses and used to be overweight uhhuh nthe plot follows two married megamovie stars gwen and eddie zetajones and poor poor john cusack whose material gets worse every year on the eve of their new star vehicles release a film called time over time nthe only problem gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation and the press and public have not been forgiving think meg and dennis ngosh and the director has vanished with the film holding the only print hostage nveteran pr agent lee billy crystal is called upon to clean up the mess throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie presumably distracting the stupid stupid film critics into forgetting they havent seen the movie at all n note to sony any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab nand did i mention gwens sister kiki roberts is along for the ride nand that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way noh billy youre a scamp nthe script youve cowritten with peter tolan what planet are you from nand bedazzled need i say more is a roast of hollywood and celebrity sure but its not a funny one nyes crystal tells us hollywood is lying to our faces nif you are surprised by this you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine nits about to expire naside from a scant few zingers yeah se or winces rules namericas sweethearts jokes arent funny its pace is choppy and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project not for headlining star julia roberts but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself ni didnt time it the movies not that bad but its crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film nbad move billy your jokes suck nthe crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movies gags and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene how this movie earned a pg13 rating is a mystery to me njulia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friends wedding into a winning film but not even that 90tooth smile can save her here nobviously aware of the ugliness before him director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria as a lisping spaniard christopher walken the insane time over time director and alan arkin a new age guru in a fright wig to crack wise nnone of the stereotypes is successful except for walken azaria comes off as a preening queen when hes supposed to be macho nas for roth in case you dont know went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio revolution which produced this work nhes back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years nitll probably be another 11 before hes back again ni could drone on about how americas sweethearts will only appeal to the mouthbreathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies but that would get old ninstead ill settle for discussing the movies worst sin that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable not just in its plot but in its sentiment nevery single character in this film with the arguable exception of kiki is simply hateful and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains nwhen you leave the theater youll ask yourself too why would i want any of these jerks to be happy n
 you damn dirty apes nthats just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes thats taken on a comedic context over time nno one back then seemed to realize how overthe top charlton hestons acting style was but it shows now particularly in this mystery science theater 3000 wannabe that was taken for a film masterpiece in its time actually winning one oscar for makeup no less and being nominated for a couple others nit also spawned multiple sequels like beneath the planet of the apes escape from the planet of the apes return of the planet of the apes beneath the escape from the return of the planet of the apes planet of the apes the next generation police academy of the apes nthe list goes on nheston is an american astronaut who spends a few thousand light years in space with his three companions and ends up on a planet not too dissimilar from earth nthe thing is on this planet humans cant talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species nhestons companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned nhe surprises them all with his gift of speech making two primate scientists roddy mcdowall and kim hunter believe heston is the missing link between ape and man nbelieve me we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years nwhen the two apes present the idea before a judicial counsel the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans it is received as heresy for all good monkeys know god created ape in his image nbut heston has already seen a cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species before apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president nand he takes them there holding up a baby doll and yelling if humans couldnt speak then how do you account for this talking doll nand how do you account for your acting ability mr heston nthe absolute most laughable scene comes with the movies surprise conclusion ni wont reveal the details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees on a beach and yelling god damn you all to hell nseveral times in succession nthe movie is atrocious and should only be viewed by those members of society who like to watch bad movies and laugh at them nwhat makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony a condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution nbut let me tell you if darwin could see the ape masks and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges heston to female ape may i kiss you before i go nape but nyoure so nugly hed convert to creationism on the spot nluckily for us sciencefiction movies have evolved over time to the point at which some of them are actually good n
a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets nthe film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities nthe result is merely an academic exercise leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldnt build on to show them as the poets they were non paper this shouldnt have been so terrible it had a talented director in agnieszka holland the secret garden a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton dangerous liaisons and a capable cast nbut the film was done in by its inept script the unappealing way the film was directed and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud ni found his performance to be the most risible one in the film with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade nhe especially looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be nbut when the two of them were together it looked like a mismatch nleonardos rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude yet we know from rimbauds poetry that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring nthe film opens in postrevolutionary france in 1871 the 16yearold rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems nhe accepts verlaines praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville nonce there rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household has an immediate conflict with verlaines busty 18yearold wife mathilde romane and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her familys money even though he has nothing else in common with her nwhen verlaine states poets can learn from one another rimbaud replies in a haughty tone only if theyre bad poets nhe will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship nverlaine proves to be weakwilled beating his wife regularly and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud nwhen mathildes father kicks rimbaud out of the house verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers nits a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce nin brussels verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail nwhile rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 nhe instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gunrunner and after ten years there comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 nthe hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying nthe film ends on a whimper with nverlaine talking with rimbauds sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published nthis film was especially annoying because rimbauds poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry ni have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film but whatever it was it just didnt work nit certainly didnt bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the socalled father of modern poetry n
i have a confession neven though i am a movie junkiei saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch moviesive never seen any of the original godzillas n note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u s godzilla released in 1998 its the american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira nisen mireniamu nso part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000the latest entry in an almost 50year old franchise nthis was a longawaited treat ni was expecting a goofy good time complete with bad dubbing science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line nthe last thing i expected was for the movie to be so boring ni can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt nyou do get all of the so bad theyre good traits so normally associated with the franchise nbut you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot nits a deal i wasnt willing to accept nhiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimuras script crams in way too many details and in many cases fails to follow up on them nthe maneuver is not only disconcerting but gives the movie a permanent logy weighty feel ngodzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops nwas it a whim na bold political statement ni dont know nits foe an ancient meteor that looks like prudentials logo doesnt just fight the beast from the far east nno its got to have lifesaving powers a plot to erase the data from japan a desire to clone and the ability to become a spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature ntheres a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit takehiro murata and a slimy government official hiroshi abe over the handling of godzilla and personal issues nand then theres the plucky news photographer and blah blah blah nits like watching magnolia all over againexcept without the good writing keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs nwhat a waste nwhen the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you godzilla 2000 does the jobits entertaining and goes down easy nthe action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish nthe dubbing is nice and awful with murata sounding like hes in constant need of a cough drop nas for the dialogue one line summarizes the goofiness factor did anyone see that flying rock go by nthis movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that ive heard the word imbecile used in casual conversation nthough the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments i wouldnt take kids to see it ntheyll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose n
 what is this a homicide or a bad bmovie nthat is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie nlet me clear things up for you cupcake this isnt a bad bmovie its a really bad bmovie nso bad its almost good nalmost but not quite nthe movie starts off in the 1950s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth nit is a bunch of sluglike creatures that kill people and take over their bodies nthe slugs first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody nthat is until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986 nhe and the slugs inside him promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more coeds into slug zombies na slightly crazed cop tom atkins and the requisite girl with the face of an angel jill whitlow join these two geeky university students jason lively and steve marshall to do battle with the slugs nit more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs nthe acting is bad with a capital b the story is worse nand the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie nthe only saving grace was the requisite titshot courtesy of jill whitlow nit had absolutely nothing to do with the story but i liked it nactually it was the high point of the movie for me nof course that isnt really saying much nthe story moves around in a hap hazard fashion nwhich gives it a leg up on some other horror films nunlike most movies of this genre there actually is a story nnot a great one but it is there nthis is one in a long line of movies from the 1980s that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th halloween and nightmare on elm street movies nyou could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better nbut night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a bmovie horror marathon njust dont be too upset if you cant find it nyou really wont be missing that much n
when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass ntoss out your usual objectivity ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it forget how unbearable it was to sit through and find some meaningless way to compliment it nthis of course will be of no service to your readers but at least youll avoid the hate mail from the movies fans nthus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot ndirected by vicky funari as a labor of intense love she spent the last one third of her life on film the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez npaulina was a maid in vickys household when vicky was young ni got to learn the films background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present nfor those without such context the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film nthe acting is amateurish the story is maudlin and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie ngrainy and overexposed the movie shot on 16mm film and videotape has little to recommend it nconfusingly composed the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story nquite bloody at times the story full of horrific images seems designed to shock and repulse us nwhy else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8yearold paulina nanother scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her nin retaliation she bites off part of his finger nthis covers the both of them in a bucket of blood nthe passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner none for example sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body nthe lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten ncertainly she had to endure a miserable life nbut that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good ni felt trapped in the theater watching it nonly the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable npaulina runs 1 28 nthe film is in spanish with english subtitles nit is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers n
from a major league baseball radio broadcast featuring playby play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown with special guest commentator james berardinelli nhc as we go to the top of the 8th were joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli whos here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie major league back to the minors the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors nnice to see you jim nas a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer can you give us the scoop on the new flick njb my opinion the producers should have stopped while they were ahead and that was nine years ago none entry was definitely enough and im surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released directtovideo nits worse than a mediocre madefortv feature ni should also mention that this movie likely wont play all that well in cleveland nnow that the real indians are perennial contenders they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks nactually most of the action involves the twins aaa minor league club the buzz rather than the actual major league franchise nhc sorry to interrupt jim but we still have to do playbyplay for the game on the field nleading off this inning is john warren nhe steps into the batters box and takes kents pitch low for ball one nwh so the storys strictly minor league right nwhats it about njb scott bakula the guy from quantum leap plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell nwhen twins owner roger dorn once again portrayed by corbin bernsen needs a new manager for his aaa team he offers the job to gus who is now faced with two daunting tasks turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson played by walt goggins for a promotion to the show nwith the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano dennis haysbert rube baker eric bruskotter and isuro tanaka takaaki ishibashi gus gets the buzz on the right track nin fact he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the bigleague club leonard huff played with overthetop relish by ted mcginley nsoon dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus overachieving group against huffs overpaid lastplace bunch nwh can we guess who wins njb the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when youve already seen the box score non top of that none of the mockups are presented with much flair ntheyre not just boring theyre lackluster nbut the major league movies have never been about drama or tension theyve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs nhc warren fouls off a fastball n1 and 1 nwh are there lots of yuks in this one njb not one from start to finish ni enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny nokay a lot of the jokes were sophomoric but they made me laugh nthe two sequels havent just been stale but their humor quotient has been abysmally low neven bob ueckers oncesharp oneliners have turned lame and theyre the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing nhc heres the 11 pitch nlooooooong drive fair or foul foul ball nthe count goes to 1 and 2 nwh does the film at least get the baseball details correct njb yes nthere arent any glaring errors like there were in one of the bestever baseball movies the natural nbut id gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story believable characters or even a little genuine humor nheck the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league back to the minors nwh its nice to see old friends one more time isnt it nlike cerrano tanaka and dorn njb depends on whether you really care that anyone is back nthere arent any real characters here just an assortment of cliched oddballs nyeah the voodoo hitter the catcher who cant throw back to the pitcher the japanese player and the conceited playerturnedowner have all returned but who really cares nthey have no depth nnotable absences include tom berengers veteran and charlie sheens wild thing nwe dont really miss them though nhc breaking ball low and outside n2 and 2 nwh so youre saying that we should give this one a miss njb thats right nto use baseball terminology its a threepitch strikeout nif youre looking for a good movie that involves baseball try popping the natural field of dreams bull durham or even the first major league into the vcr nactually this is an oddlytimed release since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters neven the minor league seasons are already underway ndont bother with major league back to the minors nits a wretched time waster nwh thanks for the advice njb youre welcome nhc and heres the 22 pitch nfouled back right into this booth nhey jim heads up noops nsomebody better get him some ice for that nhe may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls nodd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him almost as if he has a grudge to settle nanyway back to the action on the field n
your first clue that something isnt gonna be quite right with the movie youre about to see its heavily christmasthemed and its release date is oh say at the end of february nyour second clue that something isnt gonna be quite right with the movie youre about to see charlize theron one of the movies dubious stars makes an appearance on the daily show in which when asked if her new movies any good she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh nassuring us that yeah it sure is a movie all right nand theres some scenes like those youd expect to find in a movie and theres some action nand theres other nstuff ntoo nhow to immediately grab my attention open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits nthen show a caption reading six days earlier nya know i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas nhow to immediately lose my attention follow your opening scene with a terminally dull niceguyswhodontdeservetobeinprison scene nwrite a line for the one of prisoners like i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad nthen have ben affleck actually say that line on film and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor nfor good measure throw in a poorly motivated prison riot and have afflecks best buddy stabbed naw nand just two days before his release too nalready the cliches are piled on thick and when it rains it pours nhow to take my attention dash it violently against the rocks and make it so that im contemplating my strategy for calling shotgun about an hour before i know the credits will roll deny your characters the ability to think nhave ben affleck for some reason ill never understand pretend hes his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend played by charlize theron nhave gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist nthe villains big idea nkidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are then dress up in santa suits create some diversions and rob the place non paper it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks hes looking at the makings for some sort of clever actioncrime thriller nits not like the man isnt capable nfar from it nhes the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may nhe wowed me with some the most memorable car chases ive ever seen in last years ronin nbut hes certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers nput reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr moreau nstep one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible cast ben affleck in the role of the worlds most generic hero nhe gets no good oneliners he doesnt get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie nhis name is rudy short for rudolph in all likelihood nsee its called reindeer games nget it nget it nshut up nin the past affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man nstep two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible gary sinises villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with nhes dirty and pottymouthed hes got long scruffy hair and a goatee and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them nhes also extremely inept at what he does nhe thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises and he trusts afflecks character to pull through even after time and time and time again he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him nbut instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role sinise seems to think hes playing some sort of tough smart and smooth criminal mastermind rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script non a side note gary sinise wins this weeks title naward as hes the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings nlast weeks winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards nhow to take your bad idea and make things worse include two or three plot twists that instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely nthis is a bad movie nand whats worse is that except for a few moments near the notsostunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad nif theyd done that much at least i would have been entertained n
one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself nsuch was the case with boxing helena 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch daughter of the great david lynch nmade in the dying years of posttwin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs it was hyped as another warped twisted masterpiece of lynch clan nkim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract nbut the result was extremely disappointing film which quickly sank into welldeserved oblivion nthe movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh played by julian sands talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena sherilyn fenn beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair ncavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to reestablish the relationship nduring one of such occasions helena is hit by a car and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her nafter she wakes up helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaughs stylish residence but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping nshe is still trying to escape so cavanaugh takes off her arms napart from casting sherilyn fenn audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies this film by ms lynch hasnt got anything in common with the works of directors more talented father ndespite rather bizarre subject the style of this film is conventional and setting is light characters are beautiful but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray njennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos nthe actors arent good either njulian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains being neurotic doesnt suit him nbill paxton was better for this role but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helenas boyfriend nsherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks but even the her greater effort in acting couldnt help this film nthe screenplay on the other hand is awful at least for someone who had made bestseller with laura palmers diary the events in this movie are implausible characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion none of those subplots involves character of cavanaughs regular girlfriend played by betsy clarke nthe twist at the end although unpredictable is unbelievable and the viewers who had the stomach to endure entire film would feel cheated nall in all boxing helena is disorganised quasiartistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basingers career n
the first film produced by adam sandlers happy madison production company clever title eh is essentially a one joke movie much like the movies sandler stars in himself nhowever the difference here is that this one joke just isnt very funny nrob schneider stars as the title character a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a manwhore to raise enough money to replace a wealthy clients custom made fish tank which deuce destroyed while staying in his home ndeuce goes on numerous dates and each woman he goes out with has a humorous quirk about herself none has narcolepsy one has tourettes syndrome one is a man netc etc nmy problem is that we see all of these women in the films trailer so why do i need to watch the movie nseen the trailer nseen the film nonly a quick cameo from norm macdonald and a follow up joke during the closing credits generates any chuckles ndeuce bigalow male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video a division of diney nthe disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 85 1 and features the original theatrical trailer as well as trailers for mystery alaska happy texas and outside providence an extremely brief production featurette which contains footage not used in the film and storyboardtoscene comparisons nyep you read that right nthere are storyboard comparisons on this dvd ntwo scenes are storyboarded nneither of which are particularly exciting nthere are fight scenes in this movie so why arent we seeing storyboards of those segments especially the parody moments from the matrix ni wonder whats funnier the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that diney thought fans of this film would want to see them ndeleted scenes nsure naudio commentary nyou betcha nbut storyboards ncome on nr n
man this was one wierd movie nsimilar to conspiracy theory in that it couldnt decide which genre it is nthe first hour is your standard stock aliens clone which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship nthe last half hour nthis was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided screw it lets just kill everybody nfrom then on forget scifi this nmovie becomes 100 horror nwhat really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way ninstead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare this movie just uses loud noises sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore yawn everyones nseen it all before and knows when to expect it nthe one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew nthere are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed but what did this nthen finally after being painfully restored the new crew views the video nthe acting isnt too bad at all considering what the actors had to work with anyway as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of nthere was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space nthis movie could have been so much better nit had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with nthere was just nothing new here that any of us havent seen before in aliens or hellraiser n
even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material as this subpar submarine comedy proves ndown periscope stars kelsey frasier grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officers james coburn plan to get him out of the navy nlike any lame emsemble comedy the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out the fat guy who eats all the time the beautiful woman who doesnt belong there lauren holly the secondincommand who does everything by the book rob schneider the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out harry dean stanton and so on nthen comes the transparent plotline nfirst grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard nafter the ship is fixed up come the early drills where everyone seems completely inept like the electrician who cant connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone nfinally and this covers the final hour of the movie grammer has to lead his men and holly to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise nand he has to be a clever rebel to do it in scenes that stretch all levels of believability nfirst theyre singing louie louie like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off then thirty minutes later theyre making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off nthe whole while evil captain coburn is overacting underwater cursing grammer as most people watching the movie probably are too nits all predictable without any original humor to redeem it nthe jokes are right out of mchales navy and other cutrate sitcoms of the past ntheres one scene where schneider looks through the ships pantry in disgust holds one food can up and announces this expired in 1966 ni yelled back at the screen so did these jokes ni watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it nmy mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and around the start of the second hour i started writing my will nthe blame cant really be placed on the stars though nkelsey grammer is good in this he just doesnt have anything to work with nhis character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had welcome aboard tatooed on his penis ngrammer probably did something even worse got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about nsame for holley save the penis part who is likeable in down periscope just because shes so gorgeous nas for schneider whose character is downright annoying there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas although hes still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the snl ship nmy theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy okay its police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster njudging from the video box most other movie critics agree with me nthe only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channels jim ferguson ni guess even jeff craig from 60 second preview who said tank girl kicks butt nwithout ever seeing it didnt like this n
 virus is a monster movie without a monster nany movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise nsadly virus does not deliver on any level nthe movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something we never find out what to a big boat with lots of satellites on it nsudddenly a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat ncut to seven days later we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures nsee they spend all their time sailing around looking for deadinthewater ships to rescue and then collect the reward money nat least i think thats what they do nalong with many other things in the film their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isnt really explained nso they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it and decide to haul it back to russian waters nthe only problem is the crew starts disappearing onebyone and turning into borg nyes borg ncomplete with the red laser beam in place of an eye napparently this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical nso it creates makeshift machines and uses humans for spare parts nblah blah blah ni could go on forever describing the ludicrous socalled plot but i wont nsuffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man neverything else in this movie has been taken from other better movies nfor example many of the machines resemble those found in the littleseen japanese movie tetsuothe iron man nand the plot is right out of aliens nthe funny thing is i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie ni have a soft spot for cheesy monster movies like last years underappreciated deep rising nbut virus as i mentioned earlier doesnt even have a monster nit just has a big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption n virus is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it nbesides the lame monster its chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into nfor example there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to negotiate with the alien nnow i dont know about you but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it nthat makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life nfinally virus isnt scary nthe least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just a little scary nas it is its about as frightening as a box of cookies nskip virus nif its a cool monster movie you want rent the far superior and the granddaddy of this genre aliens n
nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the winkandaconcussivenudge bombastorama con air nthe opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an illfated barroom brawl nthe prison scenes are accompanied by voiceovers in which poe in a languid southern drawl describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met nif the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity it probably should ncage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dimwitted and ridiculous and that hes going to have to do something to keep himself entertained nand thus he slips into a familiar surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings cage plays cameron poe as a buffedup version of raising arizonas h i mcdonnough ncage should have known what he was getting himself into nhe got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock and if theres one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production even without his late partner don simpson its that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the last bruckheimer production nthe critical difference between the rock and con air is cages performance nin the rock cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time nthat sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry selfawareness nwhile the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home cages goal is different but just as simple to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact naudiences too should know what theyre getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production nin fact the marketing people are counting on it nno one who loathed the rock for its sweargruntblast repetitiveness will be converted by con air no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded ndirector simon west yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwabs soda fountain delivers exactly the kind of adrenalinetestosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture its perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma like insulin con air does the work of a gland nwhat he doesnt deliver is a moment of suspense na bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcocks notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk a really really big desk and a really really big bomb will serve the purpose nicely nif either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension they might have done something with con airs creepiest setup nat a desert stop for the planeload of convicts serial killer garland greene steve buscemi wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool ntheir teteatete is eerie and menacing providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains danny trejo ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them nin fact con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement too many characters too much editing too many dopey punch lines too much of the cheap ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts nit is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance nwhile malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack as a u s marshal goes for earnest cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep nhis recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies nit doesnt bode well for cages appearance in faceoff later this month perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over ntheres a word for people like you nicolas nthat word is called recidivist repeat noffender n
if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film it was studio 54 the late steve rubells infamous new york discotheque which came to symbolize the taboosmashing excesses of the disco eras heyday easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone all set to a thumping dance beat nso when miramax started production on 54 last year the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began an edgy film as downanddirty as the club itself written and directed by a promising firsttimer mark christopher and starring some hot young talent salma hayek neve campbell newcomer ryan phillippe and mike myers in his dramatic debut nmy how easily does the worm turn nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11thhour reshoots wrapped only a month ago a rash of studioimposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew especially christopher unhappy and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics nat the last minute though miramax did decide to screen the film so hastily scheduled was the screening that myerss last name was misspelled on the invitation not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed myself included nand with good reasonsomehow some way the supremely disappointing 54 has made the historically hip haven of hedonism nboring nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film he still must shoulder some of the blame for 54s lifelessness n54 focuses for the most part on a tightknit trio of employees at the club coat check girlaspiring disco diva anita a wasted hayek her busboy husband greg breckin meyer and most prominently the freshfromjersey shane oshea phillippe who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions nin focusing on the hired help christopher really missed the boat nwith the exception of the flamboyant alwayswoozy rubell myers in a wellmodulated turn the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers but those of the people who went there to party not necessarily the numerous vip guests but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the clubs famously hardass doormen and dance among other things the night away with the rich famous and infamous the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dows feisty dottie a disco and drugcrazed granny but shes a peripheral character at best nas such aside from the expected overhead crowd shots there is precious little actual dancing in 54 nwhat is a disco filmespecially one about the pinnacle of the movementwithout the dancing neven whit stillmans thelastdaysofdisco which wasnt so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hiptoonlythemselves clubhopping preppies featured at least one extended dance scene ndancing isnt the only thing glazed over in 54so is the sex but that may not be entirely christophers fault nfrom what ive heard his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring starting with the shane character he was conceived and actually filmed as a wild morally ambiguous bisexual which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54s legend nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out consequently so was the film naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film shanes fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie sela ward and an abbreviated bedhopping montage the sexual dimension is just about ignored nshane in this incarnation is sanitized to the point of blandness an idealistic dogooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club julie black campbell a worldly soap star with yes a heart of gold nthis tackedon romance would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience nthey fail on both counts nultimately 54s failure comes down to three letters fun nas in there isnt any to be had for the audience ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane and too little is spent on the club floor where all the action took place nanyhow though whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club it should be a euphoric height for her the crowd and the audience however the moment doesnt get a chance to reach that level for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality which also mars the films conclusion one of the lastminute reshoots nstrangely upbeat and wistful the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out theretwo of them in factbut 54 is not one of them ntheyre on cable tv a couple of documentaries produced by e and vh1 nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goingson within it show that theres still a great disco movie to be made nthe problem is after the critical and certain box office failure of 54 the subject may have run its hollywood course n
synopsis an aging master art thief his supplier and a young buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be or are they in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium ncomments this movie was boring nplain and simple nentrapment should not have been boring nit stars sean connery who can still carry an action film despite his age catherine zetajones a likeable enough film presence and ving rhames ultracool star of pulp fiction and mission impossible nit takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears a current hot topic in the news in its storyline which is set at the end of 1999 nit has some genuinely wellstaged action sequences nso what went wrong nplenty unfortunately nthe major problem with entrapment is its script nit has a beenthere donethat feel to it nnothing seems particularly inventive or original so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags it runs nearly two hours nthe screenwriters for example periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes i e n 4 days to the millennium nthis device was used much more effectively in the overlooked scifi film strange days nthe characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth surprise revelation is made nentrapment in other words relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each characters true motive is resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion nthe star power here is quite strong but the viewer cant help but feel the actors are wasted in this production nsean connery is given such mindnumbing lines as never trust a naked woman nving rhames character seems like an afterthought hes not developed at all nthe camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zetajoness tight wardrobe nthis in and of itself is not bad but after a while it has a juvenile feel to it nat least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that theyre exploiting the female body nentrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her in tights arc and pivot around laser beams nthe tagline for this movie reads the trap is set nit sure is on those who spent money to see this movie nentrapment really isnt that bad it is watchable ni would suggest however one waits until this is on cable or television to see it n
if youve been following william fichtners career and theres absolutely no reason why you should have you might have noticed that hes played some rather similar roles over the years nlike sully in the perfect storm tough gruff and a little bit scary nor law in albino alligator tough gruff and little bit scarier nor colonel william sharp in armageddon or dwayne engelman in strange days or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of pearl harbor as the abusive father of dannyhere is an actor who gravitates towards tough gruff hardhitting roles nwhich is why his performance in whats the worst that could happen nis such a shock such a delight nin the film fichtner plays a blonde haired meticulously dressed overtly effeminate dogloving detective nas alex tardio fichtners performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it nit borders on offensive but doesnt really manage it nand it borders on clich d stereotype but doesnt quite succumb to that definition either nin a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming fichtner isnt perfectyou can see him struggling a little at times concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personalbut hes pretty damned good and silly and without question the best thing in the film nin fact had it not been for fitchners sudden and bizarre appearance and his jarring screen presence thereafter i would have walked out for whats the worst that could happen nis mesmerizing in its awfulness a poorly written haphazardly edited and totally unfunny yes it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be possible nmoviegoing experience nfichtners performance doesnt exactly save the film and its not like im recommending whats the worst that could happen nsolely on the strength of the actors dramatic turnaround but his contributions do raise the films rating from no stars to oneandahalf nthumbs up to fichtner then and thumbs downway way downto everyone else involved in this sorry mess a movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesnt even warrant discussion n
this is the worst movie ive seen since the so bad i walked out on it jingle all the way nit is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap nit is crap through and through nnothing works in this film as to be expected from joel schumacher who has made only one watchable film in his entire career that being cousins nheres a man who admits hes a medicore director a rather charmingly selfeffacing statement nbut truth be told he is much worse than mediocre nnot all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again nthere is no plot anywhere and the dialogue is unrelentingly shallow preposterous and boring nthey set up mr freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest oneliners nit turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death nbut thats par for course nothing in this film makes any sense including half of arnold schwarzeneggers lines nas mr freeze arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once nthis is the same problem he had in jingle all the way and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass npersonally i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesnt retake scenes to make him understandable ncompare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in batman robin napparently james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold numa thurman is not as bad but nothing resembling good either nher poison ivy vamps around terribly chewing up scenery left and right nand her pamela isley scenes are marred by subsnl standard acting as if shes reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment ngiven the script its a wonder it didnt happen more frequently nthere is no redeeming feature in this film not george clooney as batman chris odonnell as robin nor alicia silverstone as batgirl nmichael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance nin fact there was something unsettling about his appearance which seems to have been accomplished without any makeup tricks looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man nunfortunately every scene about alfreds sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance they just go through the motions losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart nthe movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle you know theres a bunch of people but instead of a melee schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist ntheres never a moment of awe wonder or mayhem nthe only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects which are impressive and probably expensive neven then the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable nthe hockey team from hell nnot even the tv series got that stupid at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that batman robin showcases nfrustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do nblink and youll miss elle macpherson as julie madison vivica fox as a why is she even in the film vamp in freezes lair with all of two lines and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had nand in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs fries she isnt even filmed well enough to look good trust me shes quite attractive outside of this dreck nand as if the film werent bad enough to limp along with bad direction bad dialogue bad performances and bad fight scenes there are inconsistencies and illogic galore ni know its nitpicky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs why the characters arms arent ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a onearmed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet while holding on to another person no less or where the moisture comes from when freezes weapon creates tons if ice nthats all traditional comic book stuff nbut why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of bystanders nwhy is there a big switch clearly marked heat in mr freezes lair nwhy do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr freeze hand to hand nwhy does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her nwhy do batman robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency nand since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones why dont they wear masks to filter it out ni could go on and on n batman robin is a braindead pointless garish loud film that should still reign as the worst film of the year by the time 1998 rolls along nnote to warner bros if youre going to make another batman film please replace schumacher with nearly anyone nbecause it could actually get worse than this nwhat schumacher does not understand is that comic book doesnt automatically equal unbearable idiocy nthe true equation seems to be schumacher batman unbearable idiocy n
steve martin is one of the funniest men alive nif you can take that as a true statement then your disappointment at this film will equal mine nmartin can be hilarious creating some of the best laughoutloud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters nyou wont find any of them here nthe old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit nbilko and the name isnt an accident is the head of an army motor pool group but his passion is his schemes nevery episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hairbrained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base n mchales navy s granddaddy nthats the idea behind this movie too but the difference is that as farfetched and usually goofy as the television series was it was funny nthere is not one laugh in the film nthe remake retains the goofiness but not the entertainment neverything is just too clean nit was obviously made on a hollywood back lot and looks every bit like it nit all looks brand new even the old beatup stuff nmartin is remarkably small in what should have been a bigger than life role nin the original phil silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold and more than a touch of sleaziness nmartins bilko is a pale imitation nthe only semibright spot is phil hartman as bilkos archenemy nits not saying much considering martins lackluster character but hartman leaves him in the dust n
retrospective city of the living dead 1980 na film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson ni once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as dimwitted nand by golly just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead nalthough the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career this is not one of them ntwo points in the movies favour the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi keep things from falling totally into the abyss but by and large city of the living dead is a failure nand like most cinematic failures it comes down to bad writing dumb performances and lousy direction nthe story starts in new york when during a seance a medium katherine mccoll sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich massachusetts nfor reasons we wont go into here this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth nthe medium apparently dies of fright during the seance but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist christopher george nthat scene in itself is a howler why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside nand dont cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before theyre buried nanyway off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world where various grisly goingson are already happening as all saints day approaches nfulcis graphic gore is in evidence once again but here it only serves to further highlight the films flimsy script and plodding direction nthe dialogue in all manner of speaking is unspeakable nnot bad in the quotable sense like an ed wood film but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious lets explain the plot type approach nmccoll doesnt have a clue who her character is deadly serious one minute frivolous the next she at times is genuinely hard to watch nand the geezer the actors name escapes me who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses nchristopher georges performance is salvageable but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we dont care nin fact we dont care for anyone in city of the living dead though in other fulci films that hasnt mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man as he was in the beyond nas a director some of fulci idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here nhe constantly uses extreme closeups of peoples eyes a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors arent capable of nand despite some gruesome violence he barely manages a single scare in the entire film nlongtime collaborator fabio frizzi talented but always erratic offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electropop thats quite frankly embarrassing nfulcis other films of this period may be flawed house by the cemetery the beyond the black cat but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey nfor completists only n
i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews and in both instances he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon nnow i personally remember those films as a starring a major motion picture star b being funny c having great action sequences d great chemistry e decent character development nhmmm okay now on to my review of chill factor nplot a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an exarmy general to propose a nuclear device to international prospects nwhen the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps they must keep it cool on ice and rush it over to an army base before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit and kills millions of people ncritique speed on an icecream truck is probably the pitch that was used to sell this onetone movie to its backers but unfortunately the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tensionfilled original two hours of cinema is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film and the lethal weapon movies stood for nthis film is seasoned in cliches with plenty of badly written dialogue over the top acting from cuba gooding jr zero chemistry between the two leads and horribly tacky bad guys tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe nmy friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously written that we just had to crack up nthat and the formula for the films script which followed the proverbial 12 and you guessed it 3 scenario nand what about all those catchy hip names to get us to relate to the characters elvis nand nighshift oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters and yes it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel nit is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr got involved in this oneweekoldbluecheesesmelling project ndid they actually think that it would boost their careers or did they know that the script sucked but discounted any fall from grace knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall nmost probably the latter nhave you seen either fled or bulletproof nwell despite the slight differences in plot the essentials are basically the same here nyou get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people having no choice but to work together to get somewhere hating each other at first but over time learning to respect one another as individuals nyawn nadd to that the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black drive black cars and black vans and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head nnot too conspicuous eh ncall me a partypooper but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy this film just doesnt even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining none cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island do not a fun buddyaction flick make nshow cuba the money everybody n nlittle known facts about this film and its stars this is not a little known fact or anything but damn is it just me or does skeet ulrich look an awful lot like greatlooking actor johnny depp nskeets reallife nicknames include chester skeeter and mosquito nhe stands 61 was born in north carolina and got married in 1997 to that sexkitten actress from clay pigeons 7 510 ngeorgina cates nthey own a farm together in virginia and seven dogs nskeet has a long scar on his chest from openheart surgery done when he was 10 to correct a ventricle defect nactor cuba gooding jr was born in the bronx new york nin 1984 he breakdanced during the closing ceremonies of the olympic games in los angeles nhe stands 510 nactress hudson leick who plays one of the bad guysgirls in his movie is better known from her role as callisto on the popular tv series xena princess warrior nthis film reportedly had a budget of 40 million nim not exactly sure where all this money went but it certainly did not register onscreen ninterestingly enough director hugh johnson who makes his big screen debut with this film was the cinematographer on the 1996 film white squall and the 1997 demi moore vehicle g i njane 6 510 n

plot two teen couples go to a church party drink and then drive nthey get into an accident none of the guys dies but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life and has nightmares nwhats the deal nwatch the movie and sorta find out ncritique a mindfuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea but presents it in a very bad package nwhich is what makes this review an even harder one to write since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold mess with your head and such lost highway memento but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films and these folks just didnt snag this one correctly nthey seem to have taken this pretty neat concept but executed it terribly nso what are the problems with the movie nwell its main problem is that its simply too jumbled nit starts off normal but then downshifts into this fantasy world in which you as an audience member have no idea whats going on nthere are dreams there are characters coming back from the dead there are others who look like the dead there are strange apparitions there are disappearances there are a looooot of chase scenes there are tons of weird things that happen and most of it is simply not explained nnow i personally dont mind trying to unravel a film every now and then but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again i get kind of fed up after a while which is this films biggest problem nits obviously got this big secret to hide but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes nand do they make things entertaining thrilling or even engaging in the meantime nnot really nthe sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this so we actually figured most of it out by the halfway point so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense but it still didnt the make the film all that more entertaining ni guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is into it even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding ni mean showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy nokay we get it there nare people chasing her and we dont know who they are ndo we really need to see it over and over again nhow about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie napparently the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves and it shows nthere mightve been a pretty decent teen mindfuck movie in here somewhere but i guess the suits decided that turning it into a music video with little edge would make more sense nthe actors are pretty good for the most part although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty only in a new neighborhood nbut my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller who holds her own throughout the entire film and actually has you feeling her characters unraveling noverall the film doesnt stick because it doesnt entertain its confusing it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it noh and by the way this is not a horror or teen slasher flick its njust packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids nit also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since nwhatever skip nit nwheres joblo coming from na nightmare of elm street 3 710 blair witch 2 710 the crow 910 the crow salvation 410 lost highway 1010 memento 1010 the others 910 stir of echoes 810 n
you dont look at a ren magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning nyou likewise dont look at one for 88 minutes straight nsurrealist works are notable for their quirks and they are fun but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting nthat was my experience with i woke up early the day i died a surrealistic hyperactive comedy with no dialogue nits not a silent movie there is lots of atmospheric music occasional screams and weird sound effects but nobody ever utters an audible word nthough the film is distinctive its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes and as it progressed watching became a chore nthe only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudolegendary ed wood the man behind such classics as plan 9 from outer space and night of the ghouls nthe joke of course is that his films are so bad theyre good so humorous in their inanity that they become hits ni woke up early the day i died unfortunatly is so bad that its really bad nit stars billy zane titanic as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around stealing a car clothes and a load of money nour thief reaches a cemetery where he witnesses a bizarre ritual nhe falls asleep and finds himself literally in a hole with his money gone nfor whatever reason he is bent on getting his hardunearned cash back considering how easily he stole it the first time why didnt he just go steal some more nhe comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they dont have what he is looking for ni dont think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short nthe subject and the style seem to have been made for it nunfortunately twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome nit grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on up to the point where halfway through i was already weary nit might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is ni woke up early the day i died is a comedy i guess though it could have fooled me nunlike most ed wood films this one tries to be funny and fails instead of the other way around ntheres nothing inherently wrong with that in fact i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so good at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one nwhether wood actually went for comedy in his script well never know but in either case this is a failure njonathan taylor thomas christina ricci summer phoenix john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos nricci for example plays a prostitute nher role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out nthomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff nwas the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work nzane meanwhile occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up nlack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature nthe carnival sideshow climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this nobudget production nits desperately unfunny but thinks its the funniest thing since plan 9 its so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction ni hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting sendoff n 1999 eugene novikov n
i admit it ni thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies nwatching him in jingle all the way i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids nit was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg13 kindergarten cop but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence alcohol consumption burglary racism and child molestation nand you know theyll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santas elves nhe later decks a reindeer nhey man why dont you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while youre at it njingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass it must be funny school of thought narnold sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene nwhat can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents cant find a rare toy on christmas eve and will do anything to get one narnold is of course one of the parents a crack salesman who is never there for his son nhe races from the office to his sons karate game only to find out he missed it nand his kid distrusts him because hes never around n gee we havent seen that in a movie before narnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his sons affection is to get him a turboman doll which his wife rita wilson who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this told him to get weeks ago nso arnold sets out to find a turboman which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out nlet me back up for a minute here arnolds kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character which is unhealthy beyond belief nwatches the show eats the cereal sleeps on the freakin turboman sheets nid try to discourage any further obsession myself lest any kid seeing this movie think its a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want nbut nooooo the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son who dont recognize him until the last minute nthis is a sad movie all the way through but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa jim belushi who runs a bootleg toy factory nmost painful to watch is a scene at a radio station where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay an embarrassed martin mull who said he was giving away a turboman doll ncapitalism has produced some pretty evil things chia pets but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful nnever mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping your cookies are incredible its the main plot of the movie that sends the message that its okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want nmaybe thats what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house but not at mine n
take a look at the following equation na christmas carolghostbustersscrooged nyes scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether nscrooged is alternatively sick gross funny and then sickly soppy nbill murray plays frank cross a t v executive with a horrible personality nhes evil to secretary actors crew everyone except the t vs stations boss of course played by the late robert mitchum however he is then visited by a very dead exec who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts past present and future who is called the ghost of yet to come for some reason sure enough they arrive show cross how much of a s o b he is and he changes his way nhowever throughout this simple plot weve got to suffer outlandish special effects poor comedy and an very very mean performance from bill murray nfrank cross isnt funny mean hes just mean nhe also isnt very good at emotional scenes and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is and how he has changed nhowever the supporting cast are ok with good performances from mitchum allen who plays his girlfriend and john glover who plays crosss partner the ghost of christmas past isnt that bad either nsadly though the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of home alone style violence from the ghost of christmas present played by carol kane nwhoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny should be fired straight away nand the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 if i remeber correctly nwho thankfully dosent say much nthe script is horrendous nmichael odonaghue churns out terrible bad taste jokes which i guess is the whole point really then changes direction completely to emotional scenes nand he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes which are awful nthe special effects look nice but do nothing for the film ntheres some impressive make up effects also nthe music is also good which is scored by danny elfman nbut great effects and make up dont make a great film nscrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech nwhy didnt cross just look out his exec window and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him noverall then youd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided perhaps a plague n
the summer of 00 wasnt a very good one for devout cinephiles nit offered no blair witches or sixth senses the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient xmen adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update nnurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season that batterycharging at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o shit that moseys into multiplexes time of year when all those oscar contenders read quality films compete for audiences nalas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season nits also indie director neil labutes first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture and im sad to report its a resounding failure at least on this web site a mess thats as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labutes previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic ni went in expecting something decent for betty was gleefully praised its screenplay even winning an award at cannes but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment nare critics so desperate for something unique that theyre blind to how derivative the particular brand of uniqueness betty dolls out is nfor the first time labute is working from a script he has not written and he seems unsure of how to handle the material nbetty tries to be hip like pulp fiction this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men enchanting like the wizard of oz of which this film makes several allusions to and heartwarming like stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation nits labutes half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesnt even seem to have half that heart in it nnurse betty concerns a soap opera addict betty brilliantly played by renee zellweger who witnesses the killing of her husband del aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife by two hit men morgan freeman and chris rock nshe happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities nshes blocked out her husbands death and thinks shes a character in her favorite soap a reason to love nbetty sets out on the road to la with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk searching for her soap boyfriend dr david ravell greg kinnear while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit nthe labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men slipped a bit but not much with his sophomore effort your friends and neighbors then fell straight on his ass with bash a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime nthe play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist only labutes persistence in wallowing in the horrid things average people do to each other usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are nin the play paul rudd as an obnoxious jock delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim boys will be boys nanother character schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby nwhat was once so powerful about labutes work the casual nonchalant cruelty and selfishness often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree had become so over the top it was borderline comic nobviously at this point labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further but nurse betty isnt it nhe clearly has little passion for what hes doing here instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks one of the hit men is a huge soap fan and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadnt managed to transcend that tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience nnearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down as the two are made to enact softboiled tarantinoesque dialogue nthey evince little chemistry with rock constantly in over the top rant mode acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man an occupation thats represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ni think rock is a great comic yet he hasnt been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies whenever he acts and no matter the part its like hes doing the damn chris rock show nsurprisingly at least considering her work in me myself and irene renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance building on her baby faced apple pie looks nthat wideopen face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirtyyearold body nits the best work shes ever done nfreeman is effective as always though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it nthe actor plays the role in his usual calm collected manner though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and bettys suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality nthats interesting but the movie doesnt do anything with it other than crash land the subtheme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle nthe film has good moments many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear especially his confrontation with zellweger an almost soothing lyrical score and you know a movies in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it but nothing jells its parts good or bad are so disparate as to be opposing nthe film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film a mainstream female forrest gump or an oddball art film but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke nbettys screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence without which betty wouldnt make any progress in the film nnurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter like how betty becomes a nurse in the film a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victims wound because she happened to see how on tv which leads to her being offered a room with the victims girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear a little too tidy dontcha think nbetty has an interesting theme though it doesnt even seem aware of this nthe current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother with more on the way nthis is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ironically reallife survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ninstead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the 80s than the 00s the film simply uses bettys delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b no progress is made and little is unearthed except that

lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 episode 1 is a boring empty spectacle that features some nice special effects nafter the familiar a long time ago nopening the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game nthe plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo ruled by queen amidala portman jedi knights quigon neeson and obi wan mcgregor are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade nhowever this simple blockade is not all it seems and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers including facing the evil darth maul ray park nthey also meet the future darth vadar anakin skywalker jake lloyd nstar wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking script direction and characters nthe script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic nthe trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more nonexistent ntheres no underlying tension and no urgent need to see what the outcome is nthe film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story which doesnt help ntheres no snap to make the film work it moves at a plod nthe script is boring all the characters speak in morals especially anakins mother ntheres no group spirit evident here and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders its evident that not much is going to happen nthe two leads are hideously boring static characters given little to do and too much time to do it nquigon and obiwan hold no presence on film and give little for the audience to root for nthe audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul if he had been given more screen time nmaul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history even if he does provide the only straight plot line in the film all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy nanakin is annoying and unlikeable ninstead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended nits probably not surprising that his hateful little boy unfortunately blessed ani by everyone he knows joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible nthe comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks although in the end none is provided in the film by him nalthough his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny nthe only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a pod racer because i knew he wouldnt be able to talk for a while nqueen amidala is a nothing in the film she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must serve her people and go googoo over anakin nagain her role will become more important in the later episodes and is given little to do here nthe actors dont help the movie much either nliam neeson seems bored and embarrassed and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible nmcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy with little charm nthe casting director must have chose him because hes scottish like alec guinness theres little other explanation for it nnatalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script but she delivers a spunky performance nand jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice ntheres very little talent evident with him its hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there nhes not even very cute nthe main claim of the film the special effects are okay ntheres nothing impressive about them yet they complement the story well nthe cgi takes away much of the human element however nthe battle droids for example the replacement for the stormtroopers are characterless little computer graphics lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers nepisode 1 is just disappointing nits got high production values but little else nthe music is meandering except near the end nthe plot gives us noone to root for or even care for nthe effects are nice but dull nthe plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should ntheres an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair and many clich s are catered for throughout the film napart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film ndisappointing is barely the word nrating n
i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world nand i wish that filmmakers would use commandments as a blueprint on how not to do it nwriterdirector daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soulsearching in this tale of seth warner aidan quinn a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires countrywestern lyrics his pregnant wife drowns his home is destroyed by a tornado he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning nconvinced that god has broken his half of the covenant seth decides to break his and sets out to turn every thou shalt not of the ten commandments into a thou shalt and vice versa nhis wifes sister rachel friends courteney cox wants to help seth rachels selfish husband harry anthony lapaglia who tends to break a few commandments of his own thinks seth is a lunatic nthus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion ntaplitz isnt interested in treating seths tragedies as genuinely tragic making it impossible to sympathize with him ncomposer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds turning seths sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark quinns performance as seth is all wildeyed fervor without any genuine pain nthe actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought with one through five dispatched in a fiveminute montage nthe result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a highconcept movie plot nits not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth ncorporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seths false witness nonly courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve neven she cant force taplitz to decide whose story this is or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite nby the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience ncommandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith and the loss thereof at all seriously n

8mm written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery nnicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles who is asked by upper class toff mrs christian myra carter to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe nthe movie happens to be an mythical snuff movie where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed nall mrs christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not nwelles agrees and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies with video clerk max california phoenix as his guide nalthough the snuff industry hasnt really been examined in mainstream cinema 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most nthe snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away n8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much and apart from a few moments most of the action in the film is nothing you havent seen from another standard thriller nthe cast help towards the entertainment apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage nwhile he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona 1987 ever since leaving las vegas 1995 cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot such as in the terrible snake eyes 1998 nhere in 8mm hes boring uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice nand in this overlong thriller these virtues do not help keep the suspense up nonly when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving as phoenix is a true talent nhis performance is a great break away from the gloom and hes just purely enjoyable to watch ncatherine keener is completely wasted as cages wife although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves nher character though is hugely underwritten one of the most wasted characters of the year nalso fun is fargos peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director nas this film is written by the person behind seven 8mm is filled with doom and gloom and noone appears to know how to use an light switch nunlike seven 8mm isnt too clever and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives nlacking the strong characters seven featured 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment nbut director joel schumacher the completely wrong guy for the job puts style over content and while the direction and look are good its just not very disturbing nschumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience and though we are meant to be looking at the dark belly of the porn industry it doesnt exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind which misses the point nalso the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed so cliched its amazing to think its the same film youre watching n8mm is far from an success a snuffed opportunity nwith a boring lead character controversial scenes that manage not to be controversial and a director obsessed with looks what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller nultimately 8mm is probably worth renting on home video unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like nand trust me the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it n
my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies nwe are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills the corny dialog the ludicrous premises and the bad acting nsince other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together ni cant remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along nhe was not amused ni on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained nperhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity ni on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing insulting my intelligence and brought adequate moviemaking skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made at least in terms of the craft nthe movie could have been better if it were not so brusque nthis movie slaps you with conception pregnancy delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames without pausing for infancy nthe producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a womans womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an insideout cesarean nan autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect nin a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp it is used only after the skull has been exposed nthe opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good nthe writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle as bad as it gets nas the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck neve natasha henstridge was cloned from sil the original alien sexual predator but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner nin a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer marg helgenberger i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet nits enough to melt the most callous heart nat another point she protests im human too you know nshe is only half right npeter medak the director knows his business njustin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials njames cromwell his father is perfect in a short role nmarg heldenberger the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful nnatasha is an exquisite ornament ngeorge dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up nmichael madsen was there nblack buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits which is more that we can say for lazard n

if you havent plunked down your hardearned money yet for wild wild west the latest summer holiday offering from will smith let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbucks frappacino or on a ben jerrys sundae nthese treats are great relief from the summer heat nin contrast this film made me simmer in disappointment ni can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat nthis was true of star wars episode i but at least in that film the story and the characters were still in the back seat nin this film they are no where to be found nwhat remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats lots of female extras who look like cancan dancers and a clunky 80foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula ntwo men are asked to stop this threat none is artemus gordon kevin kline an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents namong his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest nthe other man is jim west will smith who prefers the shootfirstthenshootsomemore method of investigating nalthough their individual talents must be combined to achieve success their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate twoman vaudevillian act nfor example there is a scene where west being more debonair than the reserved gordon notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat which is what it is currently filled with n now touch my breast west says ngordon does so and then softly coos his approval ni found myself groaning at this kind of silliness nthe script fails to generate any sense of drama humor or fun for that matter ni did enjoy klines reserved performance but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith ncould it be that will smith is just so bankable that hes not even required to act nit was as if the director was yelling will smith do your own thing and naction nheres an example nin this scene will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people nhe must endear himself to the crowd to escape nthe director yells will smith do your own thing and naction nin another scene he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades n will smith do your own thing and naction nworse still the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess nthere are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look ntheres actually a lot of imagination at work in this film nthere are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat nand thats too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his thing this film might have been palatable nas it turns out wild wild west is the wild wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year n
if anything stigmata should be taken as a warning against releasing similarlythemed films relatively close to one another nof the four supernatural horror flicks released this year it is clearly the worst ni suppose i should have seen this coming nafter all blair witch thoroughly creeped me out sixth sense was mildly spooky and then stir of echoes had its moments but wasnt anything id lose sleep over nclearly the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping nis it then any surprise that stigmata is the dullest most horribly executed piece of mtvinfluenced tripe i have seen in a long while nno not really npatricia arquette plays frankie page a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globetrotting mother nas it turns out the rosary belonged to a recentlydeceased brazilian priest nthe priests church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue nfather kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue nhis investigation is soon called off however when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ nfather kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie s story considering shes an atheist but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on nhe eventually begins to suspect that his boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church nas it turns out the dead priest had been working on the translation of a fifth gospel before they were excommunicated nthe new rupert wainwright music video n n ni mean film stigmata is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse nindeed it would have been good if it were a music video because its only interesting for about five minutes nim not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slowmotion doubleexposure and extreme closeups whoaaaaaa other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and yes he has been to film school nhis camera trickery is interesting for a little while but eventually it becomes headacheinducing nwhat this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue such as it is with wainwright screaming at the audience see nlook at what i can do nim an excellent director nmaybe then hed explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slowmotion shots of water dripping in reverse or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ooh scary nif there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery i didnt see it njust when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story here comes a doubleexposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever narrrrrrrghhhh n n nthen again the superfluous camera trickery wouldnt bother me if stigmata had a story or characters that were remotely engaging nthough wainwrights vanity certainly doesnt help he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script nwhere are plot continuity and character development when you need them ncase in point frankie page is the character that i assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with but we arent given any back story on her character or any reason to like her nthe extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hardworking hairdresser who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building and shes kind of cute so lets start the bleeding nthe fact that shes clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesnt help either naccording to frankie page what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ngo clubbing nsure that makes sense narquette byrne and pryce give it the old college try but their characters are so onedimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable neven though frankie pages life is falling apart before her very eyes she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon neven more curiously he seems to be interested in her advances nfather andrews religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic nas for pryce he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle ill get you my pretty for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded ntrust me im not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain nwhats worse after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction veers off in another then another and ends up being totally incomprehensible nfirst of all the film doesnt even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary nhow come an atheist like her was chosen since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata nactually im not sure what frankie was posessed by nsupposedly stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest and later by some evil spirit i think nwhich one is it nthe answer to this question of course is very simple the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr wainwright wants to use this time nfurthermore the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrapup and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st thomas youll find that it is not being suppressed by the church as the film seems to claim but that it is readily available at your local library ntheres nothing the catholics need to worry about though n stigmatas religion is so offbase that it cant be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church nif they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters they should have gone allout and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns which would have been far more interesting nim not catholic in fact i don t care much for the catholic church but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means nits rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as stigmata does nit s not thoughtprovoking though it would like to be and it is definitely not scary though it pretends to be nim not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story nmaybe its an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over and over and over nlike so many films of the mtv generation this one suffers from overkill nso much is overdone in stigmata that it eventually has no effect on the audience leaving us to pick out the films many flaws nim also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st thomas is so earthshattering nwhen we finally hear it the saying sounds like something every fiveyearold learns on their first day of sunday school which means that for all its flash the whole film is really much ado about nothing nthe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog and stigmata is it n

starring arnold schwarzenegger danny devito emma thompson frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment and a big one at that njunior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman nthese are the same men that brought us the very funny twins nso foolish me i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins nso much for hopes nschwarzenegger and devito play two scientists doctors hesse and arbogast who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy nunfortunately due to circumstances beyond their control they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans and subsequently lose their funding nstill believing that their drug will work they decide to test it anyway on hesse nso dr hesse schwarzenegger artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug ntheir theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying surely it will work on a woman ndoes the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you nwell it must have to the producers of junior nadmittedly schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off nperhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny nbut it wasnt schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best nthe sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy and the accompanying emotional swings is not funny nschwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics ni kept thinking to myself with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture nbetter yet with schwarzenegger devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time why didnt they make a sequel to twins nanything would have been better than this mess ndanny devito is wasted in this movie nhis part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street n after seeing the movie if i was devito i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street nemma thompson is wasted here as well nwhile thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations she is also a fine comedian ntoo bad she didnt get to use any of that talent here nam i being too hard on this film ni dont think so nschwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood nwith a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film nthey certainly managed here nmaybe it was well intentioned but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made nif you are tempted to see this film do yourself a favor and go rent twins a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devitos comedic talents n

jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today nfrom timetotime she blows away audiences with powerful intense performances non the other hand this is the same woman who made her jawdroppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis king kong nand much as lange would probably prefer moviegoers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it if only in quality nhush is one such example nlange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasnt such a prime example of motion picture tedium nthe film opens as many socalled psychological thrillers do by posing as a light drama nwe are introduced to jackson johnathon schaech last encounter in tom hanks that thing you do and helen gwyneth paltrow a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love njackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother martha lange nthe moment i first saw martha i started looking for fangs nsoon the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm nonce that goal is accomplished she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives nas long as she gets her way martha is a perfectly amicable person but when helen defies her its a declaration of war nhush has three very simple problems its incredibly dumb its incredibly boring and its incredibly predictable at least up to the stupefying ending nthis film has absolutely nothing to recommend it with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snowcovered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrows bare buttocks nfrankly its embarrassing to watch a respected actress of langes stature give a performance like this its like a bad blanche dubois the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire nmeanwhile paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object nas in all psychological thrillers the battle lines are clearly drawn nhere its mom and against wife with jackson caught in the middle nof course since schaechs character is poorlydeveloped and badly acted its impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation nmaybe someone should ask him if hes familiar with oedipus nmartha is of course the evil one nhow do we know shes evil nshe smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor two sure signs that the devil is at work non the other hand helen is a good girl nthe evidence for this is that shes nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents nthats about it for character development nbeyond that point hush is just a series of increasingly hardtoswallow coincidences contrivances and moronic plot twists nhowever the first 85 minutes are just a warmup for the ending which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying ni cant imagine anyone no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole liking this conclusion neither there was some serious lastminute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script nbefore the climax i disliked hush by the time the end credits started i hated it nviewers invest something in every movie they watch no matter how good or bad it is ncheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable nmost entries into this wornout wormeaten genre arent especially good nfilms like consenting adults the hand that rocks the cradle and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along nin general however theyre directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension nthats not the case with really bad thrillers like this which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care nindeed the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid n
 spice world is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls nsure theres a hint of humor in there every once in a while nactually theres a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls nbut overall who cares nnot me nif you dont know by now the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood nin spice world they ride around in their big tour bus whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews namazingly all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things things they want to do not things they are required to do to keep earning money nand they keep babbling about girl power when they should really be talking about cleavage power ni mean if all it takes is girl power then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits nthe film is pg but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions youd have yourself one raunchy adult film nby the way theres something in the opening credits which says based on an idea by the spice girls nwow they got idea credit ni certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood ngiving credit for simply having the thought say girls lets make a movie nthe supporting cast fares well nroger moore the real james bond mockingly plays the clichespewing chief of the spice girls and darn it all hes fun to watch nmark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the bands manager richard e grant none question though george wendt nyoud think that spice world would envoke one of two reactions in people nif you like the spice girls youll like them even more afterwards nand if you cant stand them like me then spice world will really make you sick noddly the audience i saw the film with roughly 50 twelve yearold girls sat in silence for the entire film nwell not the two who sat directly behind me nthey kept muttering this is stupid over and over again nmaybe there is hope for humanity after all npg n
 saving silverman is a good example of a good comedy gone bad nas a love story it is good however as a comedy it falls flat on its face ni think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times and nthose were just chuckles at the most nthe movie doesnt have the oomph to make it a great movie and doesnt have the script to make it a funny movie nwayne lefessier steven zahn j d mcnugent jack black and darren silverman jason biggs have grown up all their lives together they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end nwhile in a bar after doing a show with their band based on their love of neil diamond darren meets a young woman named judith amanda peet whom he instantly falls for nwayne and j d however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again its up to wayne and j d to try and begin saving silverman nthe performances are topnotch and surprisingly they are what keep the movie afloat njason biggs right off the flop loser does an ok job playing silverman but he is stale and flat at times nsteve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier and even though the movie is about silverman lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself njack black is well jack black and he does an all right job as j d but he isnt as funny as he has been in the past namanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith and neil diamond plays neil diamond hes better at singing than acting nanyway the performances in the film are good but its too bad the script isnt nspeaking of script hank nelkans choppy script is not only badly written but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street nthe trailer for the movie as with most movies gives away everything that happens in the movie especially the funniest parts nsomewhere saving silverman was meant to be a good movie and it could have been but alas in the end it wasnt ndennis dugans direction is all right he adds a few directorial touches here and there nothing special being a simple comedy n saving silverman is a perfectly bad movie in more ways than one nit has a great cast a good director and a sweet story its njust too bad it has a bad script and is all together a bad movie n
hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell nthe last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films nin a nutshell the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous nwith the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership a lot of hong kongs best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u s productions nsuch talents as jackie chan rush hour chow yunfat anna the king the corrupter and yuen wooping the matrix have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results nnow we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai nunfortunately romeo must die bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kongs rhythms nthe film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking nenter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing russell wong nkai confronts po sing jon kit lee the son of kais boss and leader of the local chinese family na battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai who handily kicks and punches his opponents down nits not until club owner silk rapper dmx bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends nthe following morning po sing is found dead nsuspicions escalate as issac oday delroy lindo is told of the murder nhis concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture nissac implores his chief of security mac issiah washington to watch after his son and daughter nthe scene shifts to a prison in china where han sing jet li learns of his brothers murder nhe fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined nhung upside down by one foot han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work nescaping to the u s han sets out to find the person responsible for his brothers death n romeo must die is in many ways a fun film nit is both absurd and assured nthe basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes the godfather nthe relationship between jet lis han and aaliyahs trish oday reminds us of abel ferreras china girl except that romeo must dies couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another ntheir romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history nthe performances are adequate if not fully acceptable nli of course has the showiest part having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination nallayah in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace nits obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic nbut still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it ndelro lindo as issac oday carries himself well in the film nan unsung and under appreciated actor mr lindo turns out the films best performance nthe other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d b woodside as issacs son colin nthe performance is undirected with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in nan unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and or better written nfirst time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film nhaving a career as one of the industrys best cinematographers bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots and romeo must die does look good nbut the pacing of the film is lethargic only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes nthe script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in nthe big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing nand of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayahs bodyguard maurice has no comic timing whatsoever nthe best things about the film are its fight scenes njet li is a master of these intricate physical battles none needs only to see his film fist of legend to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat nhere jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that lethal weapon 4 jets u s debut didnt allow nunfortunately a lot of jets fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision nalso romeo must die must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film and that is an xray effect that appears three times during the course of the film showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent nobviously a homage to the famed xray scene from sonny chibas streetfighter the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film nits as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted none problem though about the fight scenes nthose that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon nthey do have an internal rhythm to them na heartbeat so to speak in their choreography nthe fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance nthis is created by the performance the direction and the editing nhere in romeo must die there is no staccato nevery fight scene even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern nthe rhythm is monotonous na hong kong film has a tempo that changes heightening its emotional impact nrmd is limited to a standard 44 tempo not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever na fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chans films nwatch the restaurant fight from the film rush hour and notice that the context of the fight while technically amazing is rather flat the framing and cut always do not help nnow look at the warehouse fight from rumble in the bronx nthere you have a heartbeat and emotional draw that doesnt let the audience catch its breath nthe stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted nhere in romeo must die the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl njet li is a grand and personable screen presence nits a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here none day filmmakers here in the u s will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity nuntil then well be left with emotionally hollow product like the replacement killer and currently romeo must die n
saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night and i have to say i wasnt too impressed nthis film is about an expert marine sniper played by tom berenger who is teamed with a hotshotyoungnoexperienceneverkilledaman new partner to take out some drugkingpins and military strong men in panama nsound cliche nthats only the beginning nbilly zane memphis belle played the rookie and never seemed to get a handle on his character nhe was so contrary and pigheaded in the beginning you just wanted to smack him nthen he goes crazy from the pressure but seems to immediately snap out of it nim not sure if the blame should lie with the directing editing scriptwriting or acting nbut it didnt all come together ni think berenger is a pretty good actor and he looked great in the part covered in camo face painted stalking through the jungle with his highpower rifle nbut once again his character was given some pretty bad dialogue and didnt react too logically to many of the situations nthere was very little logical development in these characters nmy biggest problem with this film was its tendency to put these two snipers in as many inchesfromdeath situations as possible nthey began to resemble g i joes the greatest american hero nand of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls nnow a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold in fact thats what made die hard so much fun the superhero avenger type nso some will enjoy the action hero heroics but i didnt think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes and the real life feel of covert operations in panama na word must be said on the camera work much of it was very nice nthe jungles of panama or their standins in this case formed a very picturesque background nand the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography nmany have seen the slowed down bulletcam following the projectile to its target nthis was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill nit was dramatic when used in flashback but nit seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots pardon the pun into the real time action then nit just seemed silly nall in all not a real dog there is some nice action good atmosphere and pretty photography nbut the plot is pretty lame the acting didnt form a cohesive whole and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics n
a movie laced with a good blend of action comedy and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product neighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed minus half of its original duo the late john belushi and nearly all of its original charm ndan aykroyd reprises his role as well as his cowriting credit as elwood blues the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a selfproclaimed mission from god along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago nas we begin elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brothers death in prison years ago ncompletely on his own elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away nbut elwood isnt completely without family nit seems he has a halfbrother of sorts not a real brother mind you just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudofather curtis cab calloway from the first film who has also passed on ndespite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata kathleen freeman to do otherwise elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band nworking as a police commander cabel chamberlain joe morton has an immediate disliking for elwood who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mothers affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet nfollowing elwood around is the lonely orphan buster j nevan bonifant who quickly learns to become a minielwood nwhen bartender mighty mack mcteer john goodman joins the group the blues brothers band is complete and once again the group travels the country crashing cars blowing things up and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock nmeanwhile cabs personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his nexttonextofkin nfrom this point the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between nthose hoping for an interesting andor funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story nonly the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours nfor those people it may be worth it for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting but when the story does intrude upon the festivities the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes musicians turned stiff actors and the pointless 10year old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing nappearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin james brown eric clapton and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors nblues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really really love this kind of music you might kind of sort of like this movie nmany many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny and if you dont have a passion for very deep bluesrock youll be bored out of your skull nmuch of this film seems nothing more than aykroyds selfserving vanity project but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this none of the excitement is passed on to the audience nand seeing three guys in threepiece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long nunfortunately those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film n

let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official and even unofficial james bond series nit is so full of selfparody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof nan omen of what is to come is provided by the precredits sequence a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man its difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie and the assassin of the title na song with woefully terrible lyrics follows and the rest of the movie is even worse nthe plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual ruletheworld so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin francisco scaramanga christopher lee putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moores 007 nthere is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95 efficiency nits as much of a mess as it sounds nbond is helped in his task by mary goodnight ekland whose character couldnt possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo nduring the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever nmaud adams later to star in octopussy is a much more stronger and useful character but she hardly features in the movie nscaramangas lackey is a dwarf called niknak who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures nworse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie nthere is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists another misguided attempt at humour nthe solitary car chase might have been a highlight but the action is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff j w npepper played by clifton james of live and let die fame yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window nhe is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie neven his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge could have been except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print non top of that debacle the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramangas funhouse nthe only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series the infinitely superior the spy who loved me a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive n
a life less ordinary r while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided for this confused confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle producer andrew macdonald and screenwriter john hodge nat the core of this strange film is a fairly basicand yes ordinarypremise nafter robert boyle regular ewan mcgregor an aspiring writer of trashy novels is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation he kidnaps navilles ian holm spoiled daughter celine cameron diaz and holds her for ransom nthe joke here is that celine is a willing victimher father threatened to cut her off financially so she wants revengeand that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping nand ultimately didnt we see this one coming nlove nso far so mediocre nbut mediocre is better than dreadful which this film is thanks in no small part to the hodges contextual frame for the romance nit turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth so the chief of heavens police gabriel dan hedaya dispatches two angels oreilly holly hunter and jackson delroy lindo to earth to hook up celine and robertor lose their angel status nthis conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture nbut it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film as it stands it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand nnot that there is much of a romance to begin with ntry as diaz and mcgregor may celine and robert are too onenote to become very endearing characters nceline is rich bitch robert is a dullard nas such it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these twothen again they never seem to really connect with each other nwhen celine and robert start to overtly act on their feelings it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural nbut i am not exactly sure if boyle and companys point was romance honestly i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish nboyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz but it remains just thatenergy not energy in service of a story or even acting nthe cast seems lost especially hunter whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling nand then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film some violent confrontations involving the angels who are not exactly angelicin fact they end up staging their own ransom scheme some mystical hokum in the climax and a cutesy claymation epilogue nwatching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell stockpiling quirks in the name of cool ninstead the film just gives quirky a bad name nmy best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic yes misspelling intended whimsy which comes through in only one scene an extended musical number where celine and robert sing beyond the sea at a karaoke bar nafter a verse or two the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter nthe scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard just relying on the innate charm of the leads allowing them to build a romantic rapport nalas not nearly enough is built for this moment comes to an abrupt end ni applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill na life less ordinary certainly delivers something different but by the time the film was over i was clamoring for a life more ordinary n i can accept failure neveryone fails at something nbut i cant accept not trying nit doesnt matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart nmichael jordan n
you know something christmas is not about presents nits about overhyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tieins nat least that would seem to be the message of the grinch which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores nhollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season nyou know the plot theres this evil furry green guy called the grinch jim carrey who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville ndown below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas nthe movie is of course a liveaction version of the beloved childrens book which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones nits rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirtyyearold halfhour cartoon but thats the case when jones version is compared to ron howards nthe tv grinch hit all the right notes boris karloffs soft deep narration thurl ravenscroft singing mr grinch max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head and the grinchs wide toothless grin nby contrast the movie hits one sour note after another nfirst there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105minute movie nyoung wideeyed cindy lou who taylor momsen is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents bill irwin and molly shannon during the holiday season nshe begins to sympathize with the grinch who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic ncindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class martha may whovier played as an adult by christine baranski nare we expected to like the grinch hate the whos and want him to steal christmas nthe grinch isnt even the villain here that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville jeffrey tambor who was the grinchs rival for marthas affection nnot only are the characters needlessly complex but the oncesimple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought nthe casting choices arent any better than the screenwriting decisions njim carrey seems woefully miscast nwhile his face is so supple that the rubber makeup seems superfluous carrey brings nothing else to the role nhis accent keeps changing i assume he was shooting for karloff but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon sean connery and cartman from south park nnot knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinchs home carrey falls back on his standup comedy and clowns around ace venturastyle nneedless to say his wisecracking antics dont quite fit the character of the grinch who is an embittered loner filled with hate nlittle taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile nshe would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story finding santa in her living room stealing the tree nhowever the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch and momsen is not up to the challenge nbottom line when youre stealing christmas movies leave this one behind n
the tagline for this film is some houses are just born bad nso i didnt expect too much from this nbut i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre ni thought liam neeson cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont ni thought mabe it will be fun nand in fact the beginning was rather intriguing nbut by the end of it i thought why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones jan de bont nthese great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality nhere is the story in the monstrously overdecorated mansion known as hill house visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor liam neeson into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation namong them is a sophisticated bisexual cathrine zeta jones a cynical dope owen wilson and a gentle and emotional lady lily taylor nactually the doctor is researching the primordial fear reaction and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch nwhat happens nbut he gets unexpected help from the house itself nit rumbles hums and belches forth remarkable sights nportals become veiny stainedglass eyeballs na fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth nfilmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains nbut the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real placing an emotional wall between audience and screen nthe second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture nis that exciting or what nthe worst thing about it is that it didnt have to be bad nits based on a great book the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson na 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent nit played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience n the blair witch project that cost less than an old car managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses nand with a 70 mill nbudget de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror nde nbont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is in itself frightening nhe is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush nbut why give him a more serious material nin the end haunting will only haunt its fledgling studio dream works skg and de bonts career as a director nyet it wouldnt be fair to say that everything is bad nthe effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated beautiful mysterious magical and spooky nbut this is where the good things end nthe music is blaring the floors moving the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming and all of this every second every moment of screen time is absolutely without life nits nothing more than a special effectsextravaganza visually impressive but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesnt engage nat first you do not know whats going on nis this part of the experiment nare these hallucinations nprojections of the subconscience nparanoia nbut in the end it shows out that this is actually happening nthe house is actually possessed nit is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window nfor ever i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and thats what i got ni believe hichock once said that its nbetter to wait for a climax than to see one nthis may be true and it might actually work but there is only one problem jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary only stupid nthey are impossible to take seriously nany paralells that you might have heard before linking this picture to kubricks the shining are absolutely baseless n shining had class style story acting but most of all talent and originality n haunting has only special effects and art direction to boast of nand those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film ncasting good actors for small pale parts only makes things worse nbut i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write most of you will see this film anyway even if the tagline would say some films are just born stupid n
whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask ni have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired followup as well as the even numbered entries in the film series nhowever i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs data nsomewhere along the line the star trek film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category and star trek generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction nits production values may be high but the writing is frequently appalling and instead of a script has a collection of references injokes and illdefined characters ngenerations opens in the late 23rd century where members of the original enterprise crew including captain james t kirk william shatner are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name nno sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus a mysterious ribbon of energy namong those rescued from the nexus is longlived alien dr soran malcolm mcdowell but he is nonetoopleased at being back in the real world nseventyeight years later soran is still trying to get back to the nexus and again encounters an enterprise this one led by captain jeanluc picard patrick stewart nsorans plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains ni dont think it is an insult to fans of star trek to suggest that to a certain extent the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a trek film nits about a chance to visit with old friends and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy nbut even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent and in generations that just doesnt happen ndata brent spiner is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing nin the films major subplot data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions a chip he has had in his possession for over a year nwhat is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step nhe doesnt get a joke nonce the chip is in place spiner gets to have a lot of fun with datas new emotions but the point is that hes no longer the data we know nif the rest of the next generation cast fares any better its only because theyre on the screen so little that theyre simply window dressing nbut then again this story isnt really about the new crew nits about kirk and picard the cowboy and the politician sharing the screen nthe huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away nperhaps because he knows this is his last goround in the part that made him a legend shatner looks like hes having the time of his life stewart on the other hand borders on the deferrential and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast nstewarts edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramounts hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was these are clearly the not ready for big screen players nby contrast the prologue which features scotty james doohan and chekhov walter koenig is the highlight of the film nthese characters have become part of the popular mythology and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress its a moment of high energy nonly thirty years of history can create a moment like that and thats time this new crew doesnt have nit certainly doesnt help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again nits also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition ni wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the trek universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on nand what a waste of malcolm mcdowell who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession nthere are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at but to do so would be to ignore generations major flaws nhowever i would like to make one recommendation seatbelts nnot just for the enterprise crew although youd think by the 24th century space travel wouldnt involve rolling around on the floor during a battle nno i think the audience might need them more nthis journey is one bumpy ride n

blatantly borrowing elements from 1993s like water for chocolate and 1991s the butchers wife simply irresistible attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy but more often than not comes off as laughable leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar t v s buffy the vampire slayer would choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on nthings get off to a bad start right from the onset as amanda sarah michelle gellar a young woman who runs her late familys struggling new york restaurant runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs on her and then vansihes into thin air nwhile out shopping she also meets tom sean patrick flanery a charming handsome man who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the department store he works for and later when he decides to drop by her dive called southern cross for lunch she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him even though she is known to not be a very good chef nsuddenly amanda finds her restaurant on the edge of foreclosure rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths nare amanda and tom destined to be together nand is it not just because of the magical food but because they really truly like each other nand what exactly is going on with the food she is making ndoes it have anything to do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food preparation n simply irresistible is a ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic fantasy thats as flimsy as a slice of bologna nit takes one jokethat people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual waysand recycles it over and over again until the film has reached an appropriate running time of 95 minutes nadd in a music montage every ten minutes these are actually the best scenes in the movie which certainly tells you something about the film itself and what youve got is an utterly empty if not necessarily boring excursion nthe cast of simply irresistible is fairly good but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting npatricia clarkson 1998s high art in which she played a druggedout lesbian is a standout as toms colleague and is thankfully given a few funny lines of dialogue nalso of note is larry gilliard jr as amandas cooking assistant and buddy who is allowed to create a seemingly full character out of only a handful of scenes nof the main stars sarah michelle gellar is fine but really does often look like shes struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material and if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future he has certainly got to pick better projects than this nthe bottom line is that simply irresistible is the exact opposite of its deprophesized title and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in midair an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid last scene my mind checked out from the characters and the romance nwhen i think about it in hindsight i should have checked out in the very first scene where the point of the action was for gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical crab nnow that certainly is what id call magical n
 return to horror high wants to be a couple different types of movies at once nthe film tells the story of a lowbudget horror movie being filmed at the closeddown crippen high a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before nbut what the cast and crew dont know is that a real killer maybe the same one that was never apprehended is going into action again non one level return to horror high is a slasher movie and it is at this level that it works the best on nwatching the film which was made in 1987 i couldnt help but take notice that the killers costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in scream and scream 2 non another level the film wants to be a slapstick comedy and there are many hints of this throughout nunfortunately most of these jokes fall flat nand the last thing the film wants to be is a behindthescenes look at an exploitation film being made nthe only problem is that while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made no cameras are shown filming it thus making it far more confusing than it had to be nand to top it all off the twist ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time nthere are story developments that are beyond ludicrous and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through nif you see the film or have seen it youll know what i mean nthe premise of return to horror high is admittedly pretty crafty and i liked the atmosphere of the school which is where the whole thing takes place nbut director froehlich judging from this movie is an incompetent director except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene nwell come to think of it there is only one scene that is actually scary and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in nbut other than that twominute distraction return to horror high is certainly no great shake nnote look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film nand strangely enough he is the first character to get the ax literally n

writers dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer nstarring jamie lee curtis william baldwin donald sutherland joanna pacula sherman augustus marshall bell cliff curtis julio oscar mechoso ni suppose im not extremely surprised that virus comes to us from a deciple of james cameron john bruno and if i strain real hard i could even say that its an obvious given particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr camerons early works nin fact virus is yet another in the long line of actionhorrorparanoia thrillers from the aliens vein a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortallythreatening entity is out to get them a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies and maybe even to the first pictures albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future nno such thing will happen to bruno whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasilandmark feature while bruno may have studied under camerons wing for years and years im beginning to wonder at what capacity and what exactly did he learn from him nin fact virus should at least be mediocre the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron a director who if anything just knows how to make a movie and then make a film like virus is just another detraction fairly aimed at this zgrade schlockfest of a film albeit a zgrade schlockfest with a respectable budget nthe film seems to not only borrow its plot from last years similarlyfated deep rising but also from a clunkish bmovie from the 80s called leviathan an underwater thriller starring peter weller richard crenna hector elizando and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part alien part john carpenters twisted remake of the thing n virus again has a similar uh selling point a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water nthey get on nthey break up into pairs and investigate nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy has taken over all the machines on board have meshed the machines with parts from corpses and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ha ha nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving not only does this film start off with a chintzy bondian opening the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir destroying any of the suspense in what could happen but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters nof its motley crew it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper a masculine potentialromanticinterest a drunken captain a black technician a tatooed aborigine a manic russian survivor and a couple other candidates for alien food none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin plain piece of writing paper nand its not the traditional argument for films like these where you may in fact want them all to be eaten even aliens played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers but this was more of a plusside for the film as a whole than the opposite instead as another cliche goes you just dont give a damn ni almost dont even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from subpar to horrific the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is and she is just not really here and the latter being and it pains me to say this as hes a particular favorite of mine donald sutherland who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performanceofwhichheshouldbeashamed nlike anthony hopkins for legends of the fall the line scrooooooo em has been thus embroidered upon my membrance nor peter otoole in caligula ngreat actor horrific performance nit happens every now and then and it only helps sutherlands career that no one except for an elite few even bothered to see this film nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can read early january when everyones still trying to catch up on the potential oscarnominees it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film its laden with complex machinery boasts respectable production design and it may even feature believable special effects if of course i or anyone else could see them n virus mostly takes place on a large abandoned cruiser and mostly at night until the dawn and mostly without the use of lights not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey but more so because as the hollywood cliche seems to go if its dark enough then the special effects will be more believable nand if you dont believe me go back and rent godzilla and tell me if theres even one shot where we see godzilla either a in his entirety in one wide shot or b n the light so that we can at least see him well you dont really have to sit through it again just take my word for it nbut all of this doesnt matter since virus is basically just one loud cluttered mess of a movie nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie ive ever seen my um favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves rain and any other oceanextremeties the film can cook up then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned well i must say thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldnt figure it out when i saw it nimagine the first attack of the aliens in aliens shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity and thats basically the whole of virus one horriblydirected action scene after the other capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members nand my god its a long damn sit nwith no interesting characters no dramatic urgency no tension not one good moment of action and no mesmerizing visuals its a wonder that it even got made nwe already know that big movie studios mentality is shallow at best and movies like out of sight and saving private ryan give you more faith in them but movies like virus manage to drain a little more out of the pool ni almost wish that instead of making this movie john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light nthey read the script they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack and he is and they still went ahead with the project only to have bruno and company shit back in their face neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie id say even more contempt should be aimed at mr bruno for making a movie that could be this bad nin fact shouts of egad man what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway nare not only justifiable but encouraged n
there are movies that pose a question in its first five minutes and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it nthen there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes nwriterdirector john herzfelds two days in the valley falls into the latter category nweaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters herzfelds tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with a altmanesque series of parallel stories nhitmen lee james spader and his partner dosmo danny aiello pop a guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox teri hatcher lying next to him showing the audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked nan understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down a couple of vice cops jeff daniels and wes eric stoltz na murder is not vice territory flirting with asian prostitues is but wes would rather play inquisitive detective nmeanwhile washedup director teddy paul mazursky is about to end his life nbut before he can do that he must find a good home for his dog nenter nurse audrey marsha mason who takes the dog and teddy for a ride nstuffy art dealer allan hopper greg cruttwell has kidney stones nwhile struggling about his fancy house he switches between moaning in selfpity and dropping condescending hints about his loyal secretarys glenne headly plain appearance ndont be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is going on nyou might like that feeling of cluelessness nherzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes nthe jigsaw puzzle assembled isnt stunning by any means though nthe characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altmans reallife heroes in short cuts even though they are interesting and funny nfunny that is if you arent comparing them to the likes of tarantinos pulp chcaracters nthe tieup is tidy but nowhere near the squeaky clean resolution of directors name nguy who also did last seduction red rock west ntwo days isnt a bad movie but there isnt much else to it than the screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters nitll keep you guessing alright but you wont remember the answers five minutes after the credits nthe flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast n a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha n pretty good bring a friend n amazing potent stuff n perfection nsee it twice n
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned ni was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 sciencefiction flick species nsquandering an intriguing premise the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success raking in over 60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ben kingsleys a splendid actor but a marquee name he aint nmiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film i doubted that theyd dare tempt fate and go for another round nso here comes species ii with a new creative team director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman respectively that fails to improve the series one iota like its predecessor species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid nthe film follows the exploits of a young man patrick ross justin lazard whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women loitering in strip clubs and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can nin other words patrick is like a lot of guys these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age but theres a catch hes an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars and whos now infected with alien dna npatricks overriding compulsion to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring nand when he becomes aware of eve natasha henstridge a halfhuman halfalien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab patricks primary focus turns to her if these two were to mate the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable warns dr laura baker marg helgenberger gamely reprising her role with admirable conviction nspecies ii opens with the mars mission and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokeylooking even splicing back to dated grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities they really skimped on production values this time around nhowever this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy bmovie is quickly answered nmr brancatos original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches nlike the first film and perhaps in homage to it theres a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitakers psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room something bad happened here nthis time laura gets to stand over a fresh shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter this is awful nand shes not even empathic nand when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefullypaced suspense sequence eve whos telepathically linked to her alienhumanhybrid counterpart whatever helpfully tells our alienhunting protagonists hes going to rape her nwhile species ii is often unintentionally hilarious at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own ntheres an amusing tongueincheek bit of product placement which doesnt really make much sense but i appreciated the sentiment as well as some supermarketrelated hijinx hes in aisle 1 ninforms eve nif the film maintained this sort of lighthearted tone it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch but to its detriment it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody effectsladened anticlimactic conclusion nmuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense and there are such gaping plot holes that its terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief nthe implausibilities are endless what about the toxic bomb in eves brain nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual nmy favourite was the slowmotion sequence in the film where eve sporting superhuman strength is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief incredulous that its being foisted upon the public nreturning headlines michael madsen who reprises tough guy press lennox and ms helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay but theres realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis nmykelti williamson portraying astronaut dennis gamble churns out an alltoofamiliar spin on a generic brashmouthed character and fine character actors george dzundza playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process and james cromwell patricks neglectful father senator ross are utterly wasted in the film nmr lazard gives his character an appropriately shiftyeyed look while returning vixen ms henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene and acquits herself nicely but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing or none at all nms henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series claiming that shes so empowered na lethal halfalien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion now thats what i call empowerment n
instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as powerful or touching ni have a name for it myself gross nthis is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully the bully looks at the rebel threateningly about to hurt him and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too nhow that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me arent present day moviegoers beyond being inspired by something like that nthis is one example there are actually some more in instinct alone of filmmakers insulting the audiences intelligence ninstincts plot is brimming with potential worldrenowned anthropologist ethan powell anthony hopkins disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa nhe was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him nafter committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport the authorities stick him in a prisons psychotics ward nassigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright or so we are told young psychiatrist theo caulder cuba gooding jr ncaulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career nof course and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison nand then theres the inevitable heartless meanie character in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulders mentor nhe cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell nlets get one thing straight dr theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen on screen or off nany good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way nnot good old theo nno he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says we need to talk about this right now nthis is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instincts already dubious credibility unfortunately its also the least of its problems ndirector jon turteltaub who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly abovepar cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that contrary to what this movies promotion would have you believe it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs nits not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus excuse the graphic depiction nit aims to inspire rather than to touch hearts nas yoda would say inspire it does not nit is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter the very experienced gerald di pego has to resort to literally telling the audience a movies story nindeed somewhere in the beginning of instinct one of the characters actually reads aloud the films plot to another character nthis like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review is a horrid insult to our intelligence ni am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation ni think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors and he chews the scenery in this movie brilliant as ever noscar winner cuba gooding jr on the other hand is dreadful nhis performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink ni liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling ni love animals and instincts prominent save the gorillaslive in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with nhowever this movies execution is completely unacceptable ntone down the violence and this will be a chick flick n 1999 eugene novikov n

its been hours since i returned from the much anticipated scifi opus mission to mars and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar nwhy nthe movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera instead shooting for the angle of a feelgood science fiction drama more akin to 2001 a space odyssey ni got the feeling that most of my fellow moviegoing patrons were expecting another armageddon nbut no mission to mars certainly isnt one large action sequence about colossal disaster nthis is a supposedly thoughtful familyfriendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel nyou have been warned nof course crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible see apollo 13 for an excellent example but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation nbrian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off nwhen he gets his hands on an intelligent systematically practical script like the untouchables or mission impossible the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally nof course theres also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name including snake eyes and the notorious bomb the bonfire of the vanities nall of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood nthat term may be too harsh but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is mission to mars my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient nif i were gary sinise i wouldnt touch de palma with a 10foot pole nsinise is a wonderful wonderful actor but after appearing in snake eyes and this vomitinducing sham im sure he wouldnt want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration nthe academy awardwinner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell a man who recently lost his wife kim delaney and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars oops forgot to mention the year 2020 nafter a barbecue gettogether for the astronauts we cut to luc goddard don cheadle and his team who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet nsuddenly a towering formation of rocks and soil probably best dubbed a sand tornado appears and creates a whirlwind of suction nfor some reason the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this as if it were a lovely piece of art nthe team is killed within seconds expect for luc who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive nimmediately a second mission consisting of astronauts mcconnell husband and wife woody and terri blake tim robbins and connie nielsen and phil ohlmyer jerry oconnell are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars nlets put the secret on hold for now and discuss the trip there nit is explained whether scientifically accurate or not probably not that a trip to mars takes roughly six months nim not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind m2m didnt capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia ninstead we join the team during their final days aboard the ship nwhat happened during the five months prior to this ndid they just play cards and tell dirty jokes nstill there are few nicely tense moments maybe the only in the movie during the timeframe involving a fuel leak ndepalmas direction is quite good in these scenes although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent organ music in space ncmon ntheres a few good imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud nits a colossal bummer that mission to mars is poorly assembled and laughably written with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists nas mentioned before anyone looking for some disastermovie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed nmaybe even cheated nafter the unbelievably hokey final shot with the words the end somehow adding insult to injury a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen nothers muttered obscenities shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling jeez that sucked nokay it did suck nbut you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy nafter all they do pretty well nsinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple and funnyman oconnell well he has a couple lines are actually amusing and intentionally so nthe digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive nso by golly where did this mission go wrong nlooking back on the appalling experience i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have nwhile watching mission to mars my suggestion would be to immediately abort or better yet dont even strap yourself in for liftoff n
for original sin the road to the screen has been rocky ninitially slated for release last november the film was bumped twice finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 nadvance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands nso is original sin really all that bad nyes it is but the melodrama does offer some rewards nthe location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of ta with angelina jolie providing the t and antonio banderas the a nmore importantly the movie is entertainingly bad nveteran readers know that as a rule i dont encourage people to patronize lousy films nmost of the time there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides the lets go laugh at the failings of others mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable nbut things are different this summer nquality films to put it mildly have been few and far between so as far as im concerned its fair to find our kicks where we may n original sin will never join such treasures as valley of the dolls road house and showgirls in the bad movie hall of fame but itll do until something worse comes along nthe film adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel waltz into darkness which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film mississippi mermaid opens in a turnofthecentury prison as jolies character slated for a dawn execution tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny nthe freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like this is not a love story it is a story about love nwary of local golddiggers cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas banderas makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign golddiggers na practical man luis chooses a frumpy looking lady hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children nimagine his surprise when his fianc e julia russell jolie turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo njulia explains that she sent a different womans image because she didnt want to be selected solely for her pretty face nluis then confesses his deception leading julie to state with great significance we have something in common we are both not to trusted nafter their wedding luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible njolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun although the filmmakers insistence on using one of banderas legs to cover jolies crotch makes it look like hes trying to climb her nluis the stupidest man who ever lived immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded nhis blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up nluis must force julia to write to her sister emily who is frantic over her lack of communication nshortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck nfinally when she cleans out his accounts and disappears luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong nincidentally if youre afraid im giving too much away rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass nalong the way private detective walter downs played by thomas jane who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie 61 turns up hired by the frumpy womans sister to find out what happened to the real julia nluis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist having decided that if he cant have her he will kill her noh the pathos of it all nthe cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story adjusting their performances accordingly nbanderas is suitably impassioned while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting and with those lips she can really pout nas for thomas jane he starts off acting suspicious and cagey then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness nhis most startling moment comes when to prove his power to humiliate he forces luis against a wall verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a fullon kiss nif anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape show them this chilling scene nand if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler show them original sin n
starring william baldwin cindy crawford steven berkoff all right the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role nnot that cindy does that bad its just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindys extraordinary acting skills but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation nand in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty but im sure that that is just a coincidence no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet well thats just a happy coincidence nsure nwilliam baldwin isnt a bad actor nunfortunately he just doesnt demonstrate it at all in this movie nim not sure if thats because most of his lines were just so hokey or if he was trying to make cindys acting look good nif it was the latter it worked ncindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie nwhich is not to say that she doesnt have room for improvement nalthough to be fair to cindy her lines were kinda cheesy in places nso right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet chose for her foray into the world of cinema nwell im glad you asked that question ncindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents nwhy woud they target someone as likable as cindy you ask nby the end of the movie you wont care nthe story is so contrived it isnt funny nanyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house without getting so much as a scratch i might add she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin nwhos character max kilpatric a police detective seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagals early films nthe point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwins characters of the run from these killer russians isnt all that bad of an idea its just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud nthe supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes nif i was baldwin id hope this film disappears nas for crawford she may indeed have some acting ability nunfortunately any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad nthis movie was obviously written with cindy in mind since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks nits too bad they hadnt spent more time on a half decent plot since ms crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much nunless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you n

bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures nmercury rising adds to a growing list including such stinkers as the jackal last man standing striking distance and the last boy scout of stale actioners he has headlined nand though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix it is every bit as stale nart jeffries bruce willis is your typical tormented fbi agent nyou know the type haunted by his job yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist nenter simon miko hughes an autistic boy who like rain man and all other autistic people is a savant nhe can merely gaze at a superencrypted message and while little computer beeps go off in his head he can understand what it says nnaturally this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government nlt col nicholas kudrow alec baldwin an nsa official bubbling over with evil has spent countless time and money implementing the newest unbreakable code mercury nhowever when two of his underlings robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman publish a mercuryencrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness simon cracks the code nnaturally this infuriates kudrow who sends a terminatorlike hitman l l nginter to eliminate the security hazard nand thats where art jeffries comes in nfor some reason thats never explained in the film the fbi is called in to help and through a series of intricate machinations art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy nin a few unrealistic sequences he enlists the aid of a stranger stacey kim dickens to help out but she is given very little to do overall nthe central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous nwhy bother trying to kill the kid i nmean who would know nits not like the kid or anyone else for that matter knew he was cracking a government supercypher nand even if he is eliminated what does that help nhes already proven that mercury can be broken ntheres always the chance that someone else would crack it but ni guess without a kid in jeopardy theres not much of a movie here nfor all its faults the film actually starts relatively well once you pass the painfully familiar teaser nthe film flirts with developing real characters and a semblance of a plot then nmr terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill quickly nmiko hughes does a decent job for his age at creating a touching performance nhowever dont go to this film looking for any new insights into autism not that many people will ninstead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddycop movie think cop and a half with a twist nwillis and baldwin are just overplaying to type nrather than creating a nuanced character baldwin simply oozes sliminess nand for willis part he simply recycles the stock role of the loner copfbi agent which he has honed in the die hard series nas almost an afterthought about halfway through the film carelessly gives him a character trait an addiction and then drops it in the next scene nbut the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay nthis film wasnt well thought out at all nthe film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible nthe carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member nat first the bad scenes just trickle in but by the gruesomely bad finale theyre a veritable flood nthe films few decent moments come in the form of bad jokes mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode nbut theyre not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile nmercury rising is a thriller that youre more likely to groan at than cheer n
around the end of 1998 a japanese cartoon came to the usa television and really wasnt that big nin fact not many people even knew what pokemon was but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time nin fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon the first movie which for what it was wasnt all that bad nit grossed 31 million in its opening weekend and went on to make almost 90 million nfans thought it was great and now is a second movie in the pokemon craze pokemon the movie 2000 which is far inferior to the original animated movie nfirst up is the plot which there really isnt much of in fact the plot what there is a bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon lugia is about it except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever nwell there you go of course ash is followed by his friends misty brock gary and his pokemon friends pikachu squirtle charizard the usual neven though the first movie wasnt a great film it was definately an enjoyable wellmade movie with an actual thin storyline nthis new movie however is nothing but garbage there is nothing good to it storywise and its only good thing comes from some plush animation and colors ncompared to the first film this movie is awfully bland from its opening titles to the end titles it tries its best to work but fails miserably at every corner nthe characters are 1dimensional the story thin as chicken broth and the writing very lame neven the so called action scenes are extremely lame and falls before it even gets a chance to go nthe voices even arent that good and almost feels like the stars dont want to be there like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie nwhich it certainly is nthe film has one thing going for it and that is the animation although not up to disney standards it is still very good with some interesting cgis and very colorful animation the colors jump out at you very fast and seem very nicely put on film nwhy a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question to be answered hopefully pokemon 3 next year will be much better than this trash nfor now watch the first one nits much much better n
stars armand assante mike hammer barbara carrera dr ncharlotte bennett laurene landon velda alan king charles kalecki geoffrey lewis joe butler paul sorvino detective pat chambers judson scott charles hendricks barry snider romero julia barr norma childs mpaa rating r review nin the 1982 updating of mickey spillanes 1947 novel i the jury hardboiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am dresses like don johnson in miami vice with less pastels and has sworn off alcohol nhowever he still smokes his lucky strikes detests all forms of authority and kills at a whim nbeyond that the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy pageturner by spillane probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers nthe movie starts off with a bang a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti rocky nafter that the movie and the book begin the same with the murder of jack williams frederick downs a onearmed detective and hammers best friend nhammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jacks death and with the help of his devoted secretary the blond and shapely velda laurene landon and the alternately friendly antagonistic police chief pat chambers paul sorvino he is immediately on the killers trail nhere the movie splits completely from the book and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia the cia one of hammers vietnam vet buddies and a kinky sex clinic nmany of the same characters from the book appear in the movie but they take on slightly different roles nfor instance charles kalecki alan king a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book turns into a suave mob boss nand more importantly hammers suspicious love interest charlotte bennett barbara carrera morphs from a runofthemill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic n i the jury is one of several cinematic renditions of spillanes books including a 1953 version which was made in 3d but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywoods production code nalthough this takes the 1982 version of i the jury closer to the core of the original subject matter it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book nrest assured the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity but it is thoroughly violent especially toward women nit features one woman having her neck slashed a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia judson scott and another woman shot pointblank in the belly by hammer himself nno one would deny that spillanes writing has a definite misogynistic nature but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment its constant equation of sex and violence much of which is played with the intention of being erotic is quite unsettling nits no surprise that the movie like the book fades to black with a dead woman on the floor n i the jury had a troubled production and was not wellsupported by the studio that made it which is one explanation why it didnt do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made nthe script was written by larry cohen who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies like its alive 1974 and its two sequels q 1981 and the stuff 1985 ncohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well but he was yanked from the directors chair after only a weeks worth of shooting because he was already 100 000 over budget nhe was quickly replaced by richard t heffron who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects nheffron was obviously brought in not for his talent but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently nit shows in the final product ncohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer but heffron has none nhe shot the movie quickly and clumsily and although some scenes ring true most of them are flat trite and invariably dull nthe movie features numerous car chases shootouts and stunts but heffrons background in television is the dominant tone despite the graphic violence and fullfrontal nudity i the jury takes on the air of a madefortv quickie with no real punch or depth nbut the problems in i the jury run deeper than the technical nthe central fault in this updating is mike hammer whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties nbecause spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person hammers character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona nwe never really get that impression in the movie there is no firstperson voiceover narration and some scenes dont have hammer in them at all nconsequently a great deal of the texture of spillanes storytelling is lost nthe period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammers moral code is thrown to the wind ndespite his characterization as a hardnosed violent misogynistic killer hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code nthe title itself i the jury refers to his antiestablishment notion of being his own law nunlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment nin this way he can be seen as above the law but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct his own morality nthe movie forgoes that aspect of his character and hammer comes off not only as amoral in societys terms but in any terms especially his own nif anything hammer always had his professionalism but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful nmaybe the scene was intended for laughs but it only cheapens hammers character and is by all accounts a lousy way to start the movie nthe blame for hammers character cant be laid on assantes shoulders because despite some unnecessary marlon brandonlike mumbling he delivers a fine performance nspillane never once described hammers physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared so any actor could conceivably portray him nof course because of the lack of written description those who have read spillanes books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations spillane who played the character himself in 1963s the girl hunters is generally considered the best of the film hammers nthe rest of actors are most unnoteworthy nwith the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino everyone who appeared in i the jury were upandcomers who basically went nowhere nmany of them ended up working in television like carrera who had a short stint on dallas in the mideighties which only adds to the madefortv atmosphere of the film nmaybe someday someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book but this is certainly not it n
i guess that if a very wild bachelor party had gone really bad there would be broken furniture traces of smack and cocaine on the floor and a dead prostitute in the bathroom ni guess that if a movie had also gone really bad there might be the same elements present ncoincidence npoor kyle a meek looking jon favreau he is about to marry his radiant fiancee laura cameron diaz nbut before he exchanges his vows he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout nbut this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get nthe prostitute has met a horrible though accidental death and drugs are everywhere nthe five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time na surprisingly calm robert boyd christian slater who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions ponders their dilemma for a few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where shell never be found nalthough they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases when they return from their trip guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends none is adam daniel stern he grows increasingly agitated nwhenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way his blood pressure increases nor that just may be because of his dysfunctional family nanother is michael who was actually responsible for her death nhe tries to bury his feelings but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well nboyd is the doer of the group nseemingly suffering from a long psychosis when he feels as if his secret is about to be exposed he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks nkyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to lauras demanding expectations nthen theres moore leland orser who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face nthe problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a cruel comedy but it presents things in a manner that just arent funny ndrugs mutilation and killing your own friends isnt something to be laughed at nas a straight psychological drama i could see how it might have worked as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimessick ways nbut this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for 2 hours nif you do like this movie i dont think that i want to know you ni did find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the smart play nand diaz adds some brightness to this film as a weddingneeding fiancee nbut her talents are essentially wasted here nits obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone nbut the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless ndo not make a very bad decision by seeing this film n
a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film ive ever reviewed on paper ni didnt know at the time that id soon encounter and despise batman robin which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer nas directed by joel schumacher who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isnt very good at either b r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion nthe plot which has mr freeze and poison ivy uma thurman planning to take over gotham city and then the vorld as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust partnership blah blah blah nbut morals are not the point of this filmtopping each bloated confusing action scene with next one is nthe garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls nsince when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel nonly george clooney comes out on top he underplays nicely and pretends like hes in a real movie n

the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride and its sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the years finest films nso naturally when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found this notion left me puzzled nit is a rare thing for a childrens movie to be praised this highly so wouldnt you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly magical piece of work na tad bewildered but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind having great expectations for the film nlooking back i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater nbelieve me i wanted to like babe pig in the city nthe plot seemed interesting enough after the events that took place in the original babe the sheeppig has become a legitimate national phenomenon nbut after a fateful encounter with a water well arthur hogget james cromwell who the movie could have used alot more of has been rendered bedridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially nthe only solution that his wife magda szubanski going from delightfully charming to downright annoying can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair i think and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public nproblem is the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded city a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion nsetting the main plot in motion mrs hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels nit is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright nhere is where the film took a wrong turn nup until this point i had being having a rather enjoyable experience nthe beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs hogget is accused of smuggling drugs nunfortunately the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel none of them being even onetenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe nthe main topic of discussion surrounding babe pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children and i believe it is nat one point a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown nat other times we are treated to surrealistic flashbacks to mrs hoggets full cavity search at the airport nin fact the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing nhowever that is as they say neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway nthe animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half let alone entertain a child nanother problem i found with the film was its sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story nif youre going to make a darker and more sinister sequel fine nit may not be my cup of tea but at least it is a noble ambition nbut to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs hogget swinging from walltowall of a ballroom in elastic overalls nit just didnt feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining and the same goes for the rest of the movie n
there s nothing quite like a gory anime nreally and this is the truth no other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said in the media about it nwith anime a common shot is watching a body getting quickly cut in two and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword nthis is a standard practice in anime or at least the half dozen or so titles that i ve seen nvampire hunter d is a gory gory film nif they ever made a live version of the film it would be banned in several countries and given a rating somewhere below xxx nit s not that it s gore is unique it s just like other gory animes but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it s story characters animation etc nit really didn t nit was disgusting and gruesome which overshadowed the story what little of it there was nit seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world because god knows that our local police force just can t seem to get a handle on vampires in the movies none evening a blond peasant girl drawn to look 17 and innocent a foreshadow that we will see her naked i guessed early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of a ten thousand year old vampire insert strom thurmand joke here nof course he never put a no trespassing sign on his yard so one can t really blame her but he s upset anyway and demands retribution nshe gets the obligatory bite on the neck aren t there other places to get blood from nit seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough nif its good enough for doctors to draw blood from then why do vampires stray from that sight nto fight the spell she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall dark and handsome vampire hunter you guessed it his name is d nthe vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires being attracted to the 17 year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much nyou see like all heroes in these kinds of stories he s a brooder who s sole purpose in life is to remain really really silent nwhen he speaks it s in cliches nheroes like this are bad when they re live even worse when animated nlater the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire who wants to marry the peasant girl because he s bored after 10 000 years of living the only clever vampire insight made in the movie will vampire hunter d rush to save her in time nwill we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable nin it s defense the animation when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing could at times be original nthe talking hand was clever and i think the inspiration for a skateboardrelated logo nand that s the best defense i can think of ni understand that vampire hunter d is supposed to be a fave among anime fans but i really don t see it nit s an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks and most importantly like all violent anime it is an excuse to see animated breasts nwhy nwhat is the point of that nmaybe i have to understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny ni m not a prude i just don t think it s warranted nit puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost nis there a neccesity in seeing a 17 year old in the shower nof course not it s done for shock nit s tasteless and despicable n
well lets see im nnot quite sure how to review this film based on its laughter factor nwell yeah i can its not funny nok so i laughed one time which warranted the 12 star but other than that i sat in my seat wondering when this pos would be over which at a running time of 107 minutes seemed like forever nin fact this could be the unfunniest movie ive seen in a long time if not the unfunniest nlet me be the first to say ready to rumble is a huge disappointment nlong time wrestling lovers david and scott dream of making it to the wcw and watching jimmy king wrestle nthat is their hero of course whom is kicked out of the wcw nwell here is where the plot thickens lol the two wish to rescue the king and put him back into the wcw but not that easily because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them while davids father wants him to become a police officer and scott is a loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots nwhat a plot eh n ready to rumble is one of those films that tries to be funny but sadly fails miserably everything in the film is imcomprehinsable and even the trailer wasnt funny nthe actors are dull the script awful and the plot which there isnt much of really nannoying nim not quite sure how great actors like these and very funny actors too are given such a lame script and directed in such a childish manner that i wonder if hollywood is ever gonna make good films these days nthis review isnt going to be very long because of the fact that there isnt much going for the film if anything at all nonly one big laugh is in the film which isnt all that hilarious ni sat in my chair wondering with this 107 nminute comedy was going to be over and sadly it went on forever nim not sure if anything could have saved this film from being such a total waste but believe me you it is nreviewed by brandon herring 42900 for more reviews please visit movie review central at http www geocities commoviefan983moviereviewcentral html n

 first rule of fight club is dont talk about fight club nthis quote deals directly with my opinion of this film because quite frankly its not even worth mentioning ndirector david fincher seven has completely gone over the edge nwith crude humor an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture im surprised i didnt walk out nthis just goes to show that hype kills nits very rare that a film so hyped up as fight club turns out to be noteworthy and this is no exception nthe story goes like this nedward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions until he meets marla helena bonham carter nnorton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle when he spots her at a session that he also attended napparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like literally living in pain nwhy any person would think of such a thing is beyond me but things do get worse nnorton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling and its on a plane that he meets tyler durden brad pitt nthe two men develop a bond and go out to a bar and by golly after they get drunk the two pitiful characters fight nhow do they come up with this stuff nanyway their fighting catches other pathetic losers attention and a club is formed nout of all this mess there manages to lie a message nfincher shows us that society is like robots nwe work in our jobs doing things step by step and want out nour insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are and we blame it on others ncall me crazy but this is common knowledge ni think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably neven with two good actors and a solid actress they only manage to weaken the story ni couldnt help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp nit just shows how desperate the script is for attention ni guess brad pitt was right for this role because i felt like beating him up myself nhis bothersome and depressing character made me disgusted at his 20 million fee nit only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more nhelena bonham carter however really had no purpose nshe just popped up on screen mumbled some lines smoked and left nthis continues for what seems like 6 hours nthe film drags on and my headache gets bigger while fight club nears what i think might be the end nunfortunately by then the film hits rock bottom nthough the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace non a side note the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer nfincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson nconcentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment wont do any good if everything else is in need of support nalso im afraid that immature men might respond to the films violence nthe last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult nwhen the film ends im just glad to get home and take some advil nyoull either enjoy what the film has to offer or agree with ed norton when he says this is so f ing stupid n

perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with this is the fake news norm macdonald at times could elicit some laughter by blurting out semioffensive phrases in his raspy voice coated with a condescending attitude nhis shtick was marked by crassness nin this movie for example when his girlfriend says that shes kicking him out because hes been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months he tries to calm the situation by saying maybe youll feel better after we have some dirty sex nthis kind of humor can only go so far but certainly cant go the distance in a fulllength feature n dirty work is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically nemotionally theyve never outgrown their pubescent years which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback nalthough having no apparent real world skills the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people nif the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart nmitch norm macdonald and sam artie lange need to come up with 50 000 in a period of two weeks so that sams dad jack warden can have a heart operation ntheir idea is to start a revengeforhire business where theyll do your dirty work nin the funniest scene and possibly the only funny scene of the movie they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot ntheir presence is established but when a lessthanhonorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge nby default dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots but it delivers jerky boys level material nexcept for the bit at the used car lot and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call nalready weak on material it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs broads and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction nbut whats really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor nrelying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying note to self note to self learn to fight he says after getting beat up note to self theres always beer he says after hitting rock bottom etc we feel like were just watching an elongated rehash of his notsoglorious days on saturday night live nmuch like the television show for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits nthe rest of the story is just dead space n

 idle hands is distasteful crass and derivative nif an original thought found its way into this horrorcomedy it would die of loneliness nplus you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teenagers the week after the tragedy in littleton colo nthe movie is insulting to horror film fans and teenagers nthe plot what little there is deals with anton devon sawa a highschool slacker whos hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed nalong the way the hand kills antons parents and his two best friends nthe friends also slackers are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them nthat is the level of thiss atrocitys humor nthe movie treats death as a joke n idle hands is gruesome and morbid nthe performances are stereotypical and cartoonish ni realize this is supposed to pass for comedy but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen nit is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life nand i can only presume that the writers of idle hands terri hughes and ron milbauer were trying to make some statement about todays young people and their values in a satiric vein nhowever its hard to laugh at death these days especially ones involving young people nwith the real horrors of the world put before us on television a stale pastry such as idle hands should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths n idle hands is bad no matter the circumstances in the world outside nbut the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings nthe time is not right for this type of movie nand as far as idle hands goes the time may never be right nthis is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema n

by phil curtolo madonna antonio banderas jonathan price in an alan parker film with music from andrew lloyd weber and lyrics by tim rice evita nnow i have to admit the trailer for this rockoperaturnedmajor motion picture is almost breathtaking for some nthe soundtrack is wonderful to listen to nso why wouldnt the movie be wonderful to see nsimple a little over 2 hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane nthe story of eva duarte madonna evita is full of drama thats trapped inside by all the notes and chords nshe was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker then goes into the field of acting and finally meets juan peron price the soontobe first president of argentina nthey fall in love and eventually marry nsounds pretty good doesnt it nwell the story gets better as eva goes on the rainbow tour across europe trying to win respect neva duarte was a wonderful lady nhowever all of the dramapacked moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood ni went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and i left with happy because i was right nthey only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar nalthough it did come off as dull the beautiful cinematography is eyecatching as was madonnas performance nas the spiritual leader of argentina madonna would have definitely been an oscarcontender had she spoken a single line nbut her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film ndont get me wrong and dont look at my grade ni am not a big fan of musicals on the big screen nif youre going to pay to see a movie you want to see a movie nnow i have to admit its a lot cheaper to pay 5 than 200 plus to see the play but thats what did me in nall this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie nnow you may be saying what kind of critic is he nand youre right nas a critic i should have given the movie a chance nbut as a 17year old quentin tarantino fan it was way too hard n n
the word to describe sharon stone is wonder nnot that she is a wonder but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent nshe has a dynamic screen presence in basic instinct turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in casino but possesses neither of those here nstone teams up with private school headmasters wife isabelle adjani to kill adjanis thoroughly unlikable husband chazz palminteri nin a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock as in homage to read steal from it turns out that someone saw them or hes not dead or maybe nkathy bates turns in a credible if unspectacular performance as an investigative police detective nher character is a bit dull but realistic although her actions at the end are puzzling nadjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation nits stone that is a disappointment among the actors nhow can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one ncostumed in skintight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring not enticingly dangerous neven the threat or promise of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out non the positive side there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive nthat is if you can put up with stones cardboard cutout character and scenes directly lifted from hitchs movies n
the most interesting part of cant hardly wait just happens to be not only the most human but for many of us the one part that many of us can easily relate to nthat is the character of denise lauren ambrose the films sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored nthe film wisely holds over this moment nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party almost ntoo nicely nfor some members of the audience read me this is basically a mirror of whats going on with them watching this film nwe sit there wondering why weve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place ni would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this nafter all this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with neveryones here the jock the homecoming queen the nerd and his dominions of trekkies and xphiles the alienated wannabe writer the school spirit girl the pothead s the wigger etc etc etc and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial lame and basically as a bunch of losers nexcept for denise who rolls her eyes at everything and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks her yearbook entry something which is done for each main character quotes oscar wilde definite pointers there nunfortunately the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film nthe film as i said portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything nhowever instead of sticking with this perhaps even going a bit further with it they let this lie and actually make these characters into our heroes nwe follow several of them all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared andor identified with them nand if we did we certainly dont want to revisit that state of being nheres a quick lowdown its graduation and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night otherwise known as the american grafitti or to a lesser extent the dazed and confused cliche nthe formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party n cant hardly wait just opts for a big indoor keg party and a little bit of aimless driving albeit of the imwhiningbecauseicantgetagirliwant brand nwe follow many people around but mostly we trail preston ethan embry of that thing you do the alienated writer whos been pining over the homcoming queen amanda the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart nnow that shes broken up with her football player boyfriend mike peter facinelli he decides to go to the party with a note hes written declaring his love for her in the hopes hell build up the guts to give it to her even nthough hes leaving for a multiweek intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut okay the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson nsince that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldnt be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film and because its a party there are some more main characters such as william charlie korsmo finally surfacing after dick tracy the nerd and his dominions who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike whos humiliated him for years but gets too caught up in drinking to do it kenny seth green the wigger who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid uh huh and denise the only exceptional character who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom dont ask with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile nugh nthe main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not american grafitti or dazed and confused two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers not to mention were extremely entertaining but to john hughes films of the 80s most notably sixteen candles nthe big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion nthis film forgets to satirize its characters and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes and nthen says that its all okay nwe cant take this film seriously nor can we take this as fun so really what good is it nbut i will tell you some things i did like i liked the direction except for a couple toooverthetop features like waytooglossy jump cuts its like an oxymoron and other obscurities ngenerally though elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement and even manage to capture an altmanesque feel to their film from time to time a thing with a note though is too hokey to really be admirable ni actually did like seth green for once in about a decade when he played a very young woody allen in radio days his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable almost nand of course lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise the one character we could have used some more of even though it would have changed the entirety of the film nhowever the character of denise really doesnt work with the film when really thought about nshes far too witty and realized at least for the first half to belong in this film and whenever she appears she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone nshes not just the cynic or the intellectual shes just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters nshe may ruin the film more but at least when shes on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves well at least well be entertained na couple other things that just dont work mikes character who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general the aimless bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda give me a break and perhaps the one thing that just doesnt work at all jenna eflmans uncredited cameo as an angel just didnt work but nice try nbasically the worst thing about this film the real reason im giving this such a low rating is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything wed do nwe dont feel for these characters because for most of us we arent stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots nthe acid test for high school movies is does it at all capture the feel of what its portraying nthe answer for this film is no nnice try though

probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind nbut there are those who will not and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies 2001 a space odyssey armageddon apollo 13 the abyss close encounters of the third kind e t nthe extraterrestrial alien and aliens nwhy nbecause there is not one original idea in mission to mars nall of it is cribbed from other films and in most cases better films nif this is the sort of thing you dont mind you might like the film nof course there are other reasons not to like mission to mars the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who havent used their brains in some time and who dont intend to start during the films running time n mission to mars manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time nthe plot cribbed greatly from 2001 concerns a team sent to mars the first manned trip ever made to the red planet nluke graham don cheadle leads the team jointly formed of americans and russians nthe team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse this being nothing like the pulseemitting monolith in 2001 that one was on the moon but when they try to study it a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them all except luke who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station which looks strangely like the rotating space station in 2001 na rescue mission is planned with husband wife team woody blake tim robbins and terri fisher connie nielsen obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell gary sinise and extra crew member phil ohlmyer jerry oconnell along for the ride nafter some zerogravity dancing they run into problems when one of their engines is blown forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel nnow stranded on mars with minimal supplies the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home nafter all that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth n mission to mars is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it so lets start with one of the things that does work director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film nthats it neverything else fails nthe failure isnt de palmas fault hes working from an atrocious script nonly during the sequence aboard the ship looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in 2001 where the rescue teams air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does mission to mars come to life na scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension until you realize that the entire dangermore dangerattempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film its just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes ntake it out and the plot isnt affected in any way nthe sequence also suffers from a few plot holes as does the rest of the film why is the ships computer which sounds strangely like hal from uh 2001 able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine nwhy did tim robbins character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside nshouldnt the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach nwhy are the characters such idiots nbecause the script makes little attempt to properly develop them nall the conflict is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know jim its too bad you cant go on this mission because you were determined psychologically inadequate because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together does anyone really talk like this ncant we find out these things in a less grating matter like maybe in a flashback nthe whole film is like that nthe filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know whats going on they must tell us exactly what were looking at every time nsample dialogue from the film shot of mars astronaut a look theres mars astronaut b you sure thats mars nastronaut a yeah thats mars all right nastronaut c hey are you guys looking at mars nthat exchange isnt actually in mission to mars but i wouldnt be surprised if it were nfor all their cribbing from kubrick spielberg james cameron and even ron howard the makers of this film havent learned to do something all those directors did very well show and dont tell nde palma used to know how but seems to have forgotten nthis is mentallychallenged filmmaking they assume the audience wont get whats going on so they explain everything five times over nfourthgraders may appreciate this but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted nthe principal actors sleepwalk their way through mission to mars never managing to do away with an apparent im just here to get a paycheck attitude ncheadle stumbles over his awkward lines narmin muellerstahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo nrobbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard decent guy performance nand sinise hams it up with wistful facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife played by kim delaney who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavyhanded monologue about the meaning of life and especially during the stolenfromnolessthanthreemovies a lollipop to whoever names them conclusion which combines endless obvious explanation and subpar cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then nand of course these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in 2001 who facilitated the evolution of life on earth those aliens were from an unknown world nit could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy mission to mars but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slowgoing nleisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it but all of the substance of mission to mars has been stolen from other films and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters nsupposedly were intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one totally different from the onecharacterdecidesnottoreturn ending of armageddon but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning nme i alternated between the two nthere is only one good thing about the way mission to mars finally ends the fact that the movie is over n
the year is barely a week old and there is already a candidate for the worst of 1997the relic a wouldbe chiller thats more successful at making the audience laugh than scream nin this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams whose last two pictures were dreadful jeanclaude van damme vehicles a creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses hypothalamii of humans and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum nhow did this creature come into existence and why does it feed on hormones nthe scientific explanation cooked up by the fouryes fourcredited screenwriters amy holden jones john raffo rick jaffa and amanda silver takes suspension of disbelief to new heights even by monster movie standards nbut as cockamamie as the science is in the film it isnt quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics nmiller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears ngive it up penelopeits a monstermovie non the flip side tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant but his role is so thankless that its hard to imagine it being played any more effectively nits quite funny to see a film indulge with the straightest of faces in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well and so recently in scream nfor example in one early scene a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night nok we all know whats coming but as if we didnt need any more confirmation he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away neveryone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie nand later miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing ndoes she make a beeline for the front door nof course notshe runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall nwith all the cliches it is only fitting the films climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film that of someone outrunning a fireball nif the relic is truly the next evolution in terror as the poster states then the horror filmand humanityis in even worse shape than we thought n
its time to take cover nafter a hiatus of about fifteen years the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest nin early 1997 there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone one on television and two in the theaters with dantes peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar nof the two i had heard that dantes peak was the better film so i decided to check it out when it was released on video nthe film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town nthe town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption nflaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky crushing homes and people nwe see people panicking people crying and even horses rearing nit is a disaster of biblical proportions signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road nsymbolism doesnt get much more blatant than that nwe learn that harry dalton pierce brosnan a volcanologist with the u s geological survey was there with his wife when the eruption occurred nharry survived but his wife did not na few years later harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dantes peak washington which we are told has been voted second most desirable place to live under 20 000 by the readers of money magazine nthere harry meets rachel wando a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dantes peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop nalthough the mayor doesnt seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up a few members of the city council are nthey are afraid that harrys presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dantes peak nthey would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug nhowever when an amorous young couple takes a skinnydip in the local hot springs they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath nthus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption nthis film contains a number of cliches nthe amorous couple is one nas soon as they doff their clothes you know theyre going to die nthe town busybody and the abrasive motherinlaw make appearances as does the deathdefying dog ncountless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable nwatching the movie i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements but some of the dialogue as well nunfortunate since much of the dialog is terrible nfor example harrys boss paul charles hallahan and a team from the u s geological survey join harry to assess the situation npaul basically tells the townsfolk that harrys eruption predictions arent cause for alarm nthis causes harry to leave in a fit of rage only to turn up the next day ready for work nwhen paul asks harry why he stayed he says with grim determination cause this towns in trouble and im the best man youve got neven better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving nhe likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water nif the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up however the frog wont move and will allow itself to be cooked n is that your recipe for frog soup nasks one of the team members n its my recipe for disaster responds harry ndantes peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious nour heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid nmayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming in a very grave tone acid eats metal nthanks for the tip nwhen we first see the u s geological survey building theres a caption labeling it as such nthis wouldnt have been so bad if it werent for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads in large letters u s geological survey ni suppose the caption is for people who cant read signs nalthough harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film the viewer has no idea why nthere is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters and the relationship seems rushed because of this nwhen they get close to kissing i was asking myself why do they want to kiss nwere they even attracted to each other nif i were the mayor i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesnt even crack a smile through the whole movie trying to pull off the roughyetdebonair act nwho does he think he is njames bond nthe eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed nthere are several warning signs prior to the eruption itself but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we dont feel as if they are leading up to anything nfor example one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot na tremor occurs ndoes he plunge headlong to his death nis he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below nno a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg nthe sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well nit wasnt none plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dantes peak nin a disaster movie theres usually one guy whos greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruptionfireearthquakeexplosiontsunamitornadometeorite and usually gets killed by the disaster nits okay of course because we all think he got what he deserved nif youre going to be unoriginal you might as well go all the way nin dantes peak the city councilmembers are concerned but they dont really try hard enough nmaybe the mayors abrasive motherinlaw should have been the one nfor no apparent reason she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt nperhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate nthere are a couple of good things about this movie nthe first is the scenery nthere are panoramic shots of forests lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful nthe second is the special effects nthey are the closest ive ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption nbut when elements which dont speak are going to be the best parts of your movie youd probably better rewrite the script n
capsule five friends at a stag party are involved in the accidental killing of a prostitute nthe coverup attempt becomes a monster that eats up the friends two wives and several innocent bystanders nthis was a real audience pleaser at toronto but it did not do much for me n low 0 4 to 4 n directed by peter berg who acted in the last seduction and copland n five buddies go on a stag outing to las vegas while cameron diaz works through the logistics of her upcoming wedding to one of them none of the buddies accidentally kills a prostitute n several people with no moral compass nthey started out with a simple innocent little cocaine party and by accident look what happened nthey have one moral person among them daniel stern and one totally amoral person christian slater nit is more selfish to let the amoral lead so they do n this film is strange but not really funny or biting nblack comedy should actually be funny as well as strange nthere should be some element of satire nthe satire is missing here ni did not find myself laughing here either nwhat we have is a strange crime tale n one just does not care what happens to these people n the same idea of people just getting themselves in deeper and deeper has been done frequently nif this film is popular it is just bringing a familiar plot to a new generation n it begins like diner particularly with daniel stern and ends up like an extended horrorcrime comic book n there are several logical holes in script nif a security man goes to investigate a complaint and disappears wouldnt the guests he was investigating be the first suspects nsomeone framed for a crime in the way shown would be judged innocent after minimal forensic detective work n i am desperately trying to avoid making this a spoiler n popular and situation ethics get a real slamming n some acting of grief is hammy and overdone nmore yelling than humor n
in the past tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman and the hilarious ed wood but lately his films just dont cut it nsleepy hollow has some unique features but the script is a terrible mess nfor those who remember disneys fantastic adventures of ichabod crane it is actually superior to this ndisneys version was at least interesting while burtons film drags on far too long without any suspense or frights nwhile the stories are similar the new version adds too much to the once likable story and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off nichabod crane johnny depp is now apparently a constable who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders nthe victims are headless and no traces of evidence were found until the murderer reveals himself hence the headless horseman nnow with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow nsure the headless horseman is an intriguing character but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster nin the original the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable nno one could stop him not even ichabod nby the end of the film it had audiences in deep thought nburton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere and how to make the main characters heroes nhe takes no risk what so ever and this is where he fails nanother pathetic element of the film was the script nlike i said earlier he just stuffed too much in at one time and made it look real sloppy kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims nhe completely butchered the story to pieces nthankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked nthe acting by depp was quite notable nhe took the nerdy character of the cartoon and simply acted it out in a better manner nif it wasnt for his quirky oneliners i doubt i could have remained awake because quite frankly i was getting sleepy njust when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress she winds up doing this nit just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster nits too tempting to let go even if the script is mush nthe atmosphere too was quite involving ni should have just gazed at the sets and the eerie fog rather than actually pay attention to what was going on nat least burtons films are eye candy even if they are trash nthe only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads and the fight between the horseman depp and casper van dien nother than that i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film and just sit back and stare at the scenery nby the end i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed nthis is the biggest disappointment of the year especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this ndont waste your time or money because your head will feel hollow n
when i originally saw the trailer for analyze this a few months ago i must admit i thought it looked kind of lame nand then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago i thought it looked outright bad nbut then when analyze this finally opened a few days ago an odd thing happened nit got great reviews ncritics were proclaiming it hilarious and a deadon parody of mob movies nwell with praise like that i figured it must be good and so i headed off to the theater nyou know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts nwell turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for n analyze this is slow unfunny and badly acted ndont get me wrong i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century but he is just out of his league here ni think the problem is he didnt quite know how to approach this material nhe plays his character mob boss paull vitti somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama nif he had played the character straight along the lines of leslie nielson in the naked gun series he probably would have been a lot more successful nas it is though he plays the character completely serious at some moments and for laughs at others nthis doesnt work nit creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold you always know its him nand the movie is badly paced too nit never takes off nit just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum ni think the blame for this should be placed on the script nits obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist but once this is established the movie doesnt really go anywhere nthe formula of the film seems to be this billy crystal says no to deniro deniro forces him and much wackiness ensues nthis formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie nive said it before and ill say it again the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not its funny nif analyze this had been funny the pacing and bad acting wouldnt have bothered me ni would have been too busy laughing to notice nbut as it is i only chuckled a few times nthe only really funny scene is a deadon parody of the godfather nsadly though i dont think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody because i was the only one laughing nbut my sense of humour i have come to realize is vastly different from the general population ni loathed theres something about mary yet loved baseketball nnow if you want a movie that i think is funny go out and see office space nits full of genuine laughs and wont leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes as analyze this did n
arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts since the late 80s but lately his films have been very sloppy and the oneliners are getting worse nits hard seeing arnold as mr freeze in batman and robin especially when he says tons of ice jokes but hey he got 15 million whats it matter to him nonce again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster that cant compare with the likes of the terminator series true lies and even eraser nin this so called dark thriller the devil gabriel byrne has come upon earth to impregnate a woman robin tunney which happens every 1000 years and basically destroy the world but apparently god has chosen one man and that one man is jericho cane arnold himself nwith the help of a trusty sidekick kevin pollack they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world nparts of this are actually so absurd that they would fit right in with dogma nyes the film is that weak but its better than the other blockbuster right now sleepy hollow but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film nanyway this definitely doesnt seem like an arnold movie nit just wasnt the type of film you can see him doing nsure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known oneliners but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going nits understandable especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources naside form that he still walked through it much like he has in the past few films nim sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days nspeaking of action where was it in this film nthere was hardly any explosions or fights nthe devil made a few places explode but arnold wasnt kicking some devil butt nthe ending was changed to make it more spiritual which undoubtedly ruined the film ni was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred but once again i was let down ni also dont know why the film took so long and cost so much nthere was really no super affects at all unless you consider an invisible devil who was in it for 5 minutes tops worth the overpriced budget nthe budget should have gone into a better script where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom nits pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie ndo they even read these things anymore nit sure doesnt seem like it nthankfully gabriels performance gave some light to this poor film nwhen he walks down the street searching for robin tunney you cant help but feel that he looked like a devil nthe guy is creepy looking anyway nwhen its all over youre just glad its the end of the movie ndont bother to see this if youre expecting a solid action flick because its neither solid nor does it have action nits just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing due to a strategic marketing campaign nsave your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience n
plot set in the future a courier has uploaded some data into a hard drive that resides in his head and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information nsince he overloaded his hard drive hes also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him ncritique incoherent boring oneact drivel with no suspense horribly unbelievable futuristic environment bad dialogue careerdefining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending nits too bad because the premise of the film was interesting but unfortunately for my friends and i this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us nits one of those films that makes you start laughing halfway through when you realize that most of the actors in it suck the location shots are filmed in dark junkyard type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic whatever and all the sets look like well nsets nthere is also absolutely no arc to this story nit basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings ngibson should stick to writing novels and xfiles episodes since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage nsome other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass henry rollins as a pumpedup cyberdoctor or something and icet as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face dont ask nthe ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghostlady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point nim ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal canada but sadly enough for us all it was nsome of the cybertravelling special effects were okay hence the 210 but overall its one of those bad movies thats just funny to watch and cringe at nthankfully for keanu he redeemed his scifi career with 1999s the matrix 7 510 nits too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent nlittle known facts about this film and its stars as of 1999 director robert longo never directed another fullfeature film nhmmm now nisnt that odd n writer william gibson immigrated from the us to canada in 1968 after being rejected for the draft nhe lived in toronto at first but since 1972 has made vancouver his home nhis 1984 novel neuromancer and its sequels 1986s count zero and 1988s mona lisa overdrive are generally considered to be the definitive works of the cyberpunk sciencefiction subgenre nthis film garnered keanu reeves a nomination in the worst actor category in the 1996 razzie awards n
in 1989 tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather nwas it deep nnope nhowever it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up nit was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was without the comic book uplift of the indiana jones and superman pictures nwhich was true nif what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic mans escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place nif those films were tom sawyer then batman was huckleberry finn nsome critics glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone realized that it was something special mr lovell gave it 12 and wrote that this is batman as batman should be nmr travers called it one of the ten best films of the year nthe praise was deserved from start to finish the film was enthralling exciting and superb in every respect nthere was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton nthe result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes nthe villains the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman take over and our epectations are always left unfulfilled when we wanted the penguin to bite off batmans nose he simply gets mad and when we want catwoman to slither over batmans body she gets pushed off a building ni admire mr burton for trying to do more then entertain but the result is a mess nnothing works out as planned it fails both to entertain and to enlighten nhints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast nalas these are only hints nthere are dont misunderstand me several moments of cinematic genuis contained catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said christopher lloyd is trapped by the penguin within a giant cage a small basket is dropped into a large river but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis na weak followup both career and sequel wise batman returns is sometimes dazzling but to often dissapointing n

can you say dated nyou can if youve seen rosemarys baby which like the exorcist was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release n mystery science theater 3000 has skewered the bad films of the past but let me tell you it could do a number on the good ones too nrosemarys baby stars mia farrow from the time she was actually goodlooking as an innocent housewife and her notsoinnocent husband john cassavettes an actor who takes an easy albeit evil road to success nit all seems so harmless in the beginning nmia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed n theres also a skull in the living room but its only for decoration ntheir elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming nalls well for about the first hour of this slowmoving film until mia eats some of the neighbors chocolate mousse and passes out nwhen she comes to she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big evil man raping her a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen nit seems like a dream and when she finds herself pregnant she almost forgets about it nand everyones helping with the pregnancy nthe neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink a goodluck charm for her to wear around her neck and the name of an obstetrician whos been in the business 66 6 nyears nmeanwhile mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight nbefore too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries nthats when you know your healths failing nthe only person in the movie whos the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend maurice evans who calls mia up to give her the bad news and immediately falls into a coma nby about the twohour mark i felt the same way nrosemarys baby is way too long and leads up to a payoff thats about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie ni guess someone put a spell on this movie n
you dont need to have seen the original species to appreciate how utterly lousy species ii is nwith few exceptions sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them but the fact that species ii is a followup isnt the only reason its so miserable nits the predictable storyline the cardboard characters the banal dialogue the failed attempts at humor the revolting special effects the gratuitous nudity all female of course the bad acting and the bland direction nthe plot simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle nthe slime well sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black nthat should have been the end of the movie right there nback on terra firma at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and as youll remember if you saw the first movie driven by a strong urge to procreate non a parallel track government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film now called eve again played by natasha henstridge and are keeping her around for some testing nthis apparently includes observing eves reaction to the dukes of hazzard tv show which she appears to enjoy neves biorhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk mates which we are forced to witness in grossout detail but otherwise there doesnt appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film unless it was written into her contract lets hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only neve finally breaks free of her confinesand her brafor the finale but the effects are so messy you cant really see whats going on npeter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams i told em not to go nat the top of his lungs referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle nmichael madsen reprises his role of press lennox so that he can enter high security areas flash a badge and claim to be press maybe as does marg helgenberger as dr laura baker the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns ntheyre both unbelievably wooden nwhats a talented filmmaker like peter medak the ruling class the krays let him have it doing directing this tripe i wonder nits an unfortunate trend this oncetalented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like species ii nlast year peter hyams gave us the relic no thanks necessary there nand the first species was helmed by roger donaldson who although certainly no genius behind the camera had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects nis it just that there are no better offers out there n species ii is worthless nworse than that its also exploitative offensive and insulting to the intelligence at every turn nits not that there isnt anything positive to say about the film nthere is nafter 92 minutes it ends n

for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters we recently went to a multiplex and saw undercover blues ni would give it one half of a star for guts nanyone in a movie this bad would have to have guts ni later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show nthe script was the worst part nthey had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh nthey had lots of great sight gags like two people trying to go in a door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door nturner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a game show nthe good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left nbuy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies ntell them the show is great and smile a lot n one of the top few films of this or any year na must see film n excellent show nlook for it n average movie nkind of enjoyable n poor show ndont waste your money n0 one of the worst films of this or any year ntotally unbearable nreview written on september 29 1993 nopinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employers n
in 1990 the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of abovethetitle stars patrick swayze demi moore and whoopi goldberg neight years later moore and goldbergs careers arent exactly thriving but they have had their share of screen successes since the same cant be said of swayze who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog nforget the mortal kombat moviesthis trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games ngood truck driver jack crews swayze must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey nalong the way jack and his crew of three run into a number of obstaclessuch as a highway weigh station evil truckers and deadly uzifiring motorcyclists nevery so often like at the end of a video game level or stage the main baddie pops up red meat loaf fresh from the triumph of spice world who wants to steal the cache of guns njust in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of whos driving what all of reds vehicles be it a pickup or a big rig are paintedyou guessed itred ni could go into more of the plot specifics such as jacks dream of having a nice home with his family the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license the fbiatf crew tracking the cargo but they are of little importance nall that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b but they fail at even this modest goal for none of the highway chaos as credibly staged as it is is terribly interesting let alone exciting nonce youve seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time youve seen it every time nas dreary as black dog is as an entertainment the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen its that swayze has to reduce himself to such work nwhile far from the best of actors he is certainly not horrible and he is a charismatic presence ni dont know if its his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog nregardless if he continues on this career track could a tv series be far behind n
movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good the bad and the despicable ni originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in 95 but i wanted to rewrite it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics nwe need to be warned about some truly awful films too nthis picture was so bad it inspired the description for my 110 rating see ratings chart below nthe only thing saving it from a 010 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno nso it does indeed have some plusses nin fairness elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff nand her ability to whine and irritate us even while nude was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone nthis character is not smart not interesting and deliberately nfar too annoying far too often nlike in 1998s bulworth when the movie was over i didnt care one little iota about the main character nat least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film though n showgirls is too stupid to make a statement nsome people claim that the story is based on the legendary all about eve of all things nif exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l mankiewicz was hed be well nhed be a good screenwriter ninstead this project may have sunk his career nhe wrote the ha ha nscript and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed nthe same team who created a good sexfilm in 1992 basic instinct struck out here with their occasional violence gratuitous xrated sex scenes and numerous and quite unnecessary lesbian overtones nthe predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer nafter the supposed streetsmart young lady gets conned out of her suitcase by a slackjawed yokel in the opening sequence she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the stardust hotel nnomi doesnt take advantage of this contact to break into the bigtime of dirty dancing right away nfirst she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club nshe sells her hot little wares at the cheetah for a short time turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience nhey i never said she wasnt a hot number nmaybe its that her body which gets her into the bigtime when the star of the stardust hotel crystal connors gina gershon stops into the strip club it certainly isnt her brains or pleasant disposition ncrystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend kyle maclachlan nhe also happens to be the pleasureseeking worm who runs the big show ncrystal gets nomi onto the stardust team and after an interminable amount of time nomi earns the role of crystals understudy nthe slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal nit was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that shes not a whore nthats a phrase we hear a few different times and its completely ludicrous nof course she is nshe sells her soul to make it big but in the end were supposed to believe that shes a better person than that nwere supposed to root for her nno way nshes a tramp and a backstabber who deserved nothingleast of all vindication in the ahem climax nshe is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is nthe subplot with a male dancer glenn plummer who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more nit sure aint character development nplummer also appeared in speed in 94 in a smaller yet better role nthis subplot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control nkyle maclachlan must have been promised a big payday or his standards have dipped since appearing in blue velvet nthat picture was weird but some critics claim its one of the best movies of the 80s nnow ol kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the 90s too nhis sleazy character is important to showgirls but we dont learn anything about him nhe uses people to get what he wants but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie nis he a villain nwho cares nultimately this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit neveryone must know by now about the softcore acts of copulation especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool nwhat few reviewers take issue with is how meanspirited this movie is neveryones either having sex exacting revenge or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge nits just too hard to take especially for over two hours nif we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world why couldnt verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers grunts and other sounds during the dance numbers nits hard to care about these people if we cant even appreciate what theyre capable of doing onstage nberkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body nafter all the world of porn is still an active dishonourable profession nperhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford noops theyre bad actors too nwell at least theyre not selfish and contemptable like good ol slutty nomi malone nuseless triviaironically elizabeth berkley played virtuous and holier than thou jessie on the teenybopper tv show saved by the bell before breaking onto the big screen n
i dont expect much from eddie murphy these days nfor the past four years the gods of cinemaor the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerateshave allowed him to make one bad movie after another nsuch films as metro doctor dolittle holy man life and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washedup hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures nthe biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film nutty professor ii the klumps nthe klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places nsherman has just invented a new youth drink that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time njanet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor and for the most ridiculous reasons nwith love on his mind sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego buddy love from the first professor who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers nwith some convoluted mumbojumbo about dna extraction sherman extracts the buddy love link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handydandy lab beaker nbut one night the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated nbecause every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy nthen the klump family all played by eddie murphy step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex flabby breasts a slew of fart and dick jokes and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes nand did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster nthe movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene npure and simple the klumps is a failure nits script was handled by not one but five screenwriters and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes nany sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process nits more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade american pie have their names stamped to this trash nhey guys quick note keep this movie off of your resumes nthe characterization of shermans family the klumps is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema neveryone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough nthe grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts nthe father is gruff is fired from a bluecollar job is sexually inadequate and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings nthe mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone nthe brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood nsherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to nbut the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy nthe family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct nand you got the feeling that these crass people couldnt act like this all the time nthe sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic nafter a while their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story nits also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line neven the best effects cant seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days nnow that i think about it the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make npeople will be lined up around the block for it nthe studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 neddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles but hell play every character in the movie ni just cant wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself n
since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993s steven spielberg drama schindlers list and directed 1993s intelligent searching for bobby fischer his new film a civil action should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career nwhat doesnt make sense is how such highprofile and superb actors as john travolta robert duvall william h macy and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project which is both dull and completely ineffective nthe film which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia certainly contains the type of story to be emotionallycharged but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings leaving us with nothing more than a poorlydone courtroom drama nbased on a book by jonathan hart which was consequently based on a true account a civil action is set in 1982 in the town of woburn mass where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann john travolta decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their childrens death from leukemia due to unknown causes njan originally decides to drop the case but when he stumbles across to corporate giants grace and beatrice foods who have plants located near the families homes he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which thus goes into the citys drinking water nsuddenly after hearing about the families heartbreak and personal stories he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery even though he is warned by his staff accountant william h macy that no money is coming in to them only going out nalso figuring into the story is jerome facher robert duvall beatrice foods corporate counsel who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his 20million offer to settle the case ncoming from such a talented writer director and cast not to mention one of the most interesting film composers danny elfman a civil action is an astoundingly emptyheaded drama one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience nperhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning nwatching the film i couldnt help but notice its similarities with 1997s far far superior film the sweet hereafter which dealt with a lawyer played brilliantly by ian holm investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children nin his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident holm interviews the grieving parents as well as the sole surviving passenger a teenage girl which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter a young drugaddict who has run away from home nnot only was the plotting similar to a civil action but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes nconsidering this it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful a sweet hereafter was not only concentrating on the school bus accident but delving deeply into ian holms character and his own personal demons as well as the teenage girl nin a civil action however i have no idea where the running time went since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness nwe do not get to know the parents very well nor any of the main characters nthrough its whole duration i did not learn one thingnot one thingabout travoltas lawyer character jan schlictmann who doesnt appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job nevery scene is tediously related directly to the premise and therefore there was no one for me to care about or root for nyouve got to work pretty hard actually to not get an audience to become involved in the parents plight since their children are dead but that is exactly what a civil action does nto be honest i would be fairly hardpressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked naside from one flashback to when a mans young son died on the way to the doctor i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes and more than once found my mind wandering ni could say the performances were good but whos fooling who nsince every character is onedimensionally written no ones acting abilities are challenged in any way ntravolta plays a lawyer well enough but thats about all he does nduvall virtually sleepwalks through his role apparently only appearing to give oneliners at every chance he gets nand what in the world is kathy bates doing in the pictures final scene as a judge nshe appears unbilled since it is just a cameo but why did she even agree to do it in the first place nfinally when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role the film left me with another question what was the point nabruptly ending without any susceptible momentum where none came before that to begin with a civil action seemed to me at least to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with n
i feel sorry for the financial backers of waterworld which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made at 172 million and is also one of the stupidest boy did they get ripped off nin fact this film is not really a movie but more of an amusement park ride with a plot nits not even just another case of cliches strung together well it is that too its something thats painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws nkevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half manhalf fish nhe is an explorermariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted nhes referred to as the mariner but they the meaner would have been a more appropriate title because hes cold rigid and strict and hes supposed the be the good guy nhe docks at a small floating village of sorts nhe trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters nfirst we meet one of the villains then the soontobe heroine a child prodigy a wacky inventor and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today but also some of the lowtech tools used by pirates and vikings nimmediately the films biggest flaw is apparent are these people primitive or highly advanced nit doesnt seem like anyone can read yet they have skidoos and airplanes nhow are these things powered nand if they have airplanes couldnt they just keep flying until they reached dry land nalso if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things nim sorry im all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us nthere was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology so why mix the two together nit doesnt make any sense nthere really isnt much of a plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything nthe only thing we learn is that the prodigy child enola mojorino has a tattoo on her back that is supposedly a map to dryland nwho put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out nwe never get an answer just a stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland nto make a long boring stupid and just plain bad story short the mariner escapes with a woman named helen tripplehorn and enola nthey sail for a long time encountering some strange people in the process and fight off the smokers as lead by the idiot villain deacon hopper who kidnaps enola nthe story becomes a overly grand adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons rescuing enola and bringing them all to salvation how original neven with all its special effects action and adventure this film is boring nnot a single character is likable therefore neither is the plot ndennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholsons joker while costner just plain rips nstill waterworld is professionally made with a good production design and an original idea but no substance to it ni just hope they dont make a sequel n
54 is dull perfunctory uninspired and boring na greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors ni however would rather cut to the chase n54 is dull perfunctory uninspired and boring nthere is nothing in it not a glimpse of depth nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight nthere is no electricity in any of the scenes or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots nand its underdeveloped and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think theyre in this years boogie nights nthey are so wrong nthe picture has been assembled by mark christopher nbased on this film i dont know how he got a job in the business n54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s ni dont know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas andersons brilliant work in every possible way from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography nwhat it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great depth intelligence energy fascinating characters and challenging themes n54 cant even measure up to the last days of disco which is flawed but still smart and entertaining nits remarkably bad timing id say to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind ni have exaggerated though there is one interesting character and one terrific performance nthat character is steve rubell played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves nsteve rubell is the owner of studio 54 and if christopher had focused on him then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself nalas we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ryan phillippe a goingnowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club thanks to rubells homosexual impulses nits here that he meets his friends the array of uninteresting characters his coworker greg brecklin meyer his wife anita salma hayek and of course the love interest julie black neve campbell nshane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning and he has a reasonably sturdy home life n some of the scenes with his father border on interesting while heather matarazzo who plays his sister pushes phillippe off the screen nbut he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs nwhy his friends push him into drugs is never really explained but the fact that they are friends is questioned only is superficial ways greg gets really mad at shane because hes been elevated to bartender status nthere isnt a single conflict that takes center stage except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works nmost of the film is dumb and most of the dialogue is inane ntheres a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black and in the next scene theyre arminarm without a bit of development nthen theyre kissing in a bowling alley nthis is five minutes of material thrown into the picture at the last minute well past the onehour mark and this isnt a long film to begin with ncampbell is a talented actress but she needs a role that gives her a little depth nthis one doesnt nand phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever this performance pales in comparison to mark whalbergs starmaking role in boogie nights nhe seems dumb and misguided and his voice never changes tone ni guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body but he seems pretty lanky to me nhes all wrong for a lead role but it doesnt help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters nby the end of 54 shanes most notable trait is his stupid fake accent nthe rest of the performances are wasted nhayek is an energetic talented young actress and does almost nothing here nmeyer is endearing but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard nonly myers by sheer force of talent manages to rise above christophers wadingpool of a script nrubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance nin fact myers is the sole reason to see 54 and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him nive read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail nfrankly i dont care nits easy to recreate something technical like this na fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task nbesides christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible anyway naside from myers performance 54 is a complete failure nits dull perfunctory uninspired and boring nsome may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair but theyre so obvious to me nin any event 54 is pallid without the contrast nit doesnt even

forget get carter ninstead nget me a cup of coffee nwhat the hell has happened to all good american action movies ndid i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere nwhen did all of the badass kicking butt and taking names guntoting crazed vengeful characters of the 1980s from such films as commando cobra predator raw deal first blood suddenly turn into innocent compassionate sensitive tearyeyed knuckleheads nthe only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east and i dont mean new york city nget carter the latest masterpiece from uberthespian sylvester stallone is a prime example of large and in charge 80s action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown nstallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up na few years ago stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey nthat role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland a strange film about redemption within a broken soul nstallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past ntoo bad get carter returns stallone to action but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges nget carter is a simple story nstallone plays frank carter a vegas bruiser for a loan shark played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore nwhen franks brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident frank feeling all guilty and mushy inside thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented carters way nhe talks tough with his brothers wife lends a helping had to his brothers daughter doreen rachel leigh cook and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee ncarter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultracool mcqueenesque mickey rourke a multimillionaire computer geek alan cumming and a strange foreign guy michael caine who speaks in riddles and talks tough ncarter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties nwhat a minute nthis sounds just like another film i saw last year the limey nbetter not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off nactually get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name starring caine in the title role and what with his cameo here the cleverness is astonishing nwhile stallone still carries his own weight here the movie lacks what the original did as well purpose nthroughout the film stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough while nobody is taking him seriously nhis oneliners fall flat and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions mental and physical required of his character nthere is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations in both fists and words nthe biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke nan amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs spousal abuse a boxing career and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character nhe may not win any oscars but he still ranks highly in my book nget carter has great directing strong acting by rourke and caine and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud nthe only thing it lacks as with most hollywood productions is a good script and proper casting nnever mind that it should never have been made at all n
the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film the world is not enough is its final frame white letters on a black background proclaiming james bond will return noh i certainly hope not nwith pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last goround as james bond 007 the world is not enough is the best example to date that enough is enough nin this the 19th chapter in the seeminglyendless franchise featuring ian flemings debonair british secret agent who likes his martinisand his nemesesshaken not stirred the subinspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups stunts and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original nweve got previouslyused speedboat chases ski chases and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines nweve got a couple of hottotrot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them nweve got a postcold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean lean panache nand as has been the case since 1977s the spy who loved me weve got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr fleming nweve also got a main title song by garbage to which with very little effort you can fit the lyrics to both songs from tomorrow never dies nwhile originality was never the series strong suit the films were almost always fun with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts ni cant think of one memorable setpiece in the entireand very dull the world is not enough nin addition michael apted yes the respected director of such films as coal miners daughter nell and the 28up documentary series takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich s nyou get the talking killer plot deviceyou know the scenario the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age nand you get a slew of highpriced assassins who cant hit a barn door at 20 paces in the films opening minutes of an endless 128 bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames and the leatherclad lovely fails to hit bonds soupedup fishing boat with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet of her nlater she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out nthese reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles vodka or credit cards nin and among the rampant product placements brosnan grapples with carlyle braveheart s sophie marceau as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king shes terrible wild things denise richards as a nuclear physicist lord help me shes laughable and judi dench as m dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to a series that has long since jettisoned its selfrespect about the time roger moore inherited bonds walther ppk nbrosnan goes through the motions with the grace and charm youd expect of the former remington steele star but even he has to be thinking theres more to life than an easy paycheck nhes given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver but only one of them i dont know any doctor jokes made me chuckle although i thought christmas only comes once a year is more in keeping with the series penchant for grownworthy puns n

this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation nbut lo and behold here comes switchback and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as kiss the girls and i know what you did last summer nbut switchback is an undoubtedly weak genre entry as the material it covers is old and tired and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting n switchback opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child shes watching nwe learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse dennis quaid and that the kidnapperkiller is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while nhe is promptly removed from the case but this conflict of interest doesnt keep him from offering pursuit nlacrosses most recent trek takes him to a bloodsoaked hotel room in amarillo texas where the local sheriff r lee ermey is torn between his reelection campaign and helping his new ally catch his man nin a related aside former railway worker bob goodall danny glover is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinupplastered even on the seatbelts el dorado nalong the way he picks up and subsequently saves the life of hitchhiking loner lane dixon jared leto nthis tangent isnt a random one as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself nor is the villain in fact lacrosse only pretending to be after the coldhearted murderer he knows so much about nin a sense thats half of the basic problem with switchback nfor its first hour the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator so were given little insight into who they are likely for fear that well learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction nbut switchback then decides to explicitly reveal the killers identity at its midpoint and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense nsome of the acting is a burdensome area as well probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves nwhat is danny glover doing here grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot nand dennis quaid n that monotone stop it nermey is solid in a supporting role thats more interesting than the two leads thrown together but the charismatic leto claire danes object of affection in my socalled life is a scenestealer tried and true nfrom a material standpoint switchback is pretty empty nbut even when firsttime director jeb stuart who wrote the fugitive and die hard doesnt know what to do he knows what he wants it to look like the movie provides some great visuals nthe setonatrain climax looks good even though the action is illogical and the beautiful crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor nstill thats not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond and more than the movies look will end up leaving you cold n
and i thought stigmata would be the worst religiouslyoriented thriller released this year nturns out i was wrong because while stigmata was merely boring and selfimportant end of days is completely inept on all fronts nits a silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess nfor a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best its extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up nfor the first time in recent memory an arnold action movie and batman robin doesnt count is no fun at all n end of days is a major stinker nthe movie opens in vatican city 1979 nsome catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation nif he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 1999 the world will be destroyed nthe pope orders protection of this girl though some priests believe she ought to be killed nin new york that very night a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy ntwenty years later we meet jericho cane schwarzenegger a suicidal excop with a drinking problem nnow working as a security guard for hire he is protecting a local businessman gabriel byrne who is actually possessed by the devil nan assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after christine york robin tunney nrecognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine including ownership of the same music box apparently jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her nthere are so many problems with this film its hard to know where to begin but how about starting with the concept ncasting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with nschwarzenegger is a persona not an actor so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea narnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions nin other words trying to give him dimension was a mistake nharrison ford mel gibson or even bruce willis could have played this role theyve all played noble and flawed heroes but not schwarzenegger nthere are several scenes that attempt to establish jerichos character one has him contemplating suicide another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christines location by offering him his old life back nnone of these scenes really work because arnie isnt up to the task nthe filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong confident character like the terminator for example the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before nthis one isnt at all believable the way arnold plays him nthe supporting cast tries their hardest and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all nas the prince of darkness hes suave and confident nhe acts like one would expect the devil to act nthe problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense more on that later and that undermines him as a powerful villain nbyrne outperforms arnold in every scene they have together including the aforementioned temptation bit but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable root for the devil nbyrnes speech about the bible being overrated actually starts to make sense mainly because arnolds attempts at refuting it mostly of the tis not nvariety are feeble at best nthe only problem is arnold has to win so in the end nobody really cares nkevin pollack plays jerichos security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides but like most bad action movie sidekicks he disappears after about an hour nrobin tunney isnt given much to do except look scared nin fact all of the supporting players are good actors but none save for byrne is given anything interesting to do nperformances aside it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it nthis being an action blockbuster its no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script which starts off totally confusing and when some of it is explained and not much of it is its utterly ridiculous nwhy is the devil coming on new years eve 1999 nbecause its exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil which isnt 666 it turns out nsome nutty priest accidentally read it upside down so the real year is 999 so just add a 1 to the beginning and youve got 1999 nif you dont buy this explanation youre not alone nits convoluted and silly at the same time nthe method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous shes christine see and she lives in new york see n n and if that werent bad enough theres plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isnt explained at all nwhy can satan kill everyone he passes on the street but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk excop hes powerless nis he impervious to only one kind of bullet nhow come he cant control jericho or christine nand how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies na clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this but its never actually explained nusually this sort of thing wouldnt matter in a schwarzenegger flick i mean dont get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting nthere are several predictable horror film clich s present in end of days complete with the old black cat hiding in a cabinet bit not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there nit gets so formulaic that its possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a boo will come ntheir predictions will rarely be wrong nthe more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless partially because we dont care about these characters due to the scripts pathetic attempts at characterization and setup and also because they too dont make any sense ntheres a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady nits good for a few chuckles but not much else nsupposedly were to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan but the script never sets that up so the scene is merely silly nnone of this is terribly exciting because all the action sequences are so badly framed that its often hard to tell why its happening in the first place not to mention that theyre edited in fullon incomprehensible mtv quickcut style nmost of them had me scratching my head rather than saying wow cool n end of days is not only silly and confusing but its also distinctly unpleasant to watch nthe devil apparently doesnt operate in the more subtle illconvincepeopletokilleachother fashion outlined in the bible but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight nthis doesnt only make him an awfully predictable sort but it also means that not a single scene in end of days goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence or the odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit that had me scratching my head nif violence is supposed to be shocking its not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb nscenes arent connected through any reasonable means so a lot of the time stuff gets blown up or people get killed and i had no idea why nreasons nto hell with reasons nlets just blow stuff up nisnt it cool nnope not by a long shot nthis film is thoroughly unwatchable nits dull interminable and unrelenting in its stupidity nperhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career because its not happening with hack peter hyams here n end of days might have had camp value if only it didnt top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobodys going to buy nif the movie is going to be serious the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script nif its going to be campy arnold shouldnt be taking himself so damn seriously i didnt actually see him put up on a cross did i and his character shouldnt be such a sad sack nas it stands end of days is just a bad movie and an awfully gloomy one at that n
certainly no one would rent ed woods glen or glenda nexpecting to see a good movie but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didnt know was possible nin fact woods infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison nwatching glen or glenda ni found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together as a result it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious nthe movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary with endless repetitive narration about transvestites how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriends clothes without being able to wear them how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals and how the main character glenglenda is as it reminds us probably half a dozen times not half man and half woman but man and woman at the same time nthe camera work is terribleoccasionally the camera lingers on say a closed door while the characters talk offscreen or inexplicably zooms in on someones ear or nose nwood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage which leads to voicedover nonsequiturs like yes our world is a busy and frightening place with so many people driving their automobiles nfinally there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankensteinstyle laboratory delivering pointless lines such as people n n nall with their own thoughts n n ntheir own ideas n n n nwhile lightning crackles quasiominously overhead nhad wood continued in this vein glen or glenda nprobably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horrormovie touch nunfortunately he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script n pull the string npull the string nannounces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears nthere is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns this time warning us beware n n nbeware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door n n n nit eats little boys n n nand puppy dogs tails n n nand big fat snails na bizarre nightmare sequence which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid ensues during which glenglenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen treein the living room nsomeone who is apparently intended to be the sinister green dragon but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series appears to be orchestrating all this though the film is far from clear on this point to put it kindly nnear the end of this sceneand here i must confess that wood lost me completelyis a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music nafter this scene ends not a moment too soon glen or glenda nreturns to its documentary style but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone nthe film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism but at that point it didnt matter much what happened nas soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over glen or glenda nhad pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen ni honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could it still might not match glen or glenda nfor sheer cinematic disaster ni am giving this movie an f but im not sure that quite does it justice n

note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned nits rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylors first feature film dream with the fishes when the plodding tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup nany hopeful expectations however are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatchedbuddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the films latter half nthe films central characters are terry david arquette a depressed lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident and nick brad hunt a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill nnick lives in the apartment building across from terry who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz kathryn erbe with his trusty set of binoculars but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a halfdrunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge unconvincingly vowing suicide nnick casually asks for terrys wristwatch and eventually cons terry into a trade the watch for a bottle of pills nof course terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch nlearning of nicks condition he only has a handful of weeks left terrys compassion kicks in and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement terry will agree to bankroll the dying nicks lifelong fantasies and nick will fulfill terrys death wish by killing him nthis is a promising premise and mr taylors film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters terry is a repessed mournful character who wants to die while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits and where the straightlaced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character nthis is bythenumbers plotting buddy movieroad movie redux nhowever dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline but by the characters which carry the story it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic if not likeable nunfortunately that is not the case here where both of the films leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits nfar from a romp this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond nmr taylors dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived witness such lines as you should have asked something more interesting like do you enjoy the pain n see thats provocative leaves room for further questions nthe film enjoys a few inspired moments the urn scene a session of nude bowling the policeman joining in on terry and nicks acid trip but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes nthis occurs particularly often during the films opening sequence as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital im realising that this is intended to be funny although nary a smile crept upon my lips which is probably due to the obvious fact that its painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nicks scheme of tricking him this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes nthe entire sequence is then clearly an exercise for character exposition with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability namong the cast coming off best is david arquette the current master in the portrayal of meek squirming stammering freshfaced characters he would have been terrific as the lead for george huangs swimming with sharks who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry nmr taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated as opposed to a bright crisp look for the smalltown scenes nthe charge of dream with the fishess protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters and indeed in many cases have i been in the minority supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult audienceunfriendly nature of their characters nfor dream with the fishes though i did find myself on the flip side of coin often hoping that the film would quickly conclude and that the nick character would just hurry up and die n
tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse nthe fugitive nnot quite this is the plot for double jeopardy another fugitive copycat without the action excitement and good acting that the original had nthere are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall clever huh noh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband bruce greenwood who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man nboth movies are on video nmake the wise choice and pick the fugitive nthere are so many flaws in double jeopardy it is laughable nwhile serving time in prison libby parsons judd discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice nlearning that her husband is still alive she decides to serve her time in prison find him retrieve her son and kill her husband if necessary nwhen the strict parole officer travis lehman jones stands in her way libby decides to break the rules who knows why and continue her plan despite the fact that if she gets caught shes going back to jail ndirector bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son nevery other scene we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture nin an action movie like this valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something nall that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend i miss my son nnothing more nothing less ndr kimble of the fugitive didnt look at one picture of his dead wife his primary concern was to save himself nlibby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough nashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this they will be typecast for the rest of their careers kind of like their doomed costar tommy lee jones nwinning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his idomyjobwhethertheyareinnocentorguilty roles npeople still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right nthough i dont think he will win another oscar again nthe ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons neven if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count nburglary assault grand theft auto are some of libbys slipups nthe message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as youre innocent of the major crime nhopefully criminals wont use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent nthat would just be plain stupid n
seen at amc old pasadena 8 pasadena ca in sdds npaul verhoevens last movie showgirls had a bad script bad acting and a plot i use the word in its loosest possible sense that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity nit stank nstarship troopers has a bad script bad acting and a plot that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore nit stinks nnobody will watch this movie for the plot but heres a brief synopsis anyway nsome friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve armed forces at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy nafter one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires the home city of the main characters war is declared nthis involves sending the grunts who include johnny rico van dien and dizzy meyer down to the surface of the bugs planet nmuch carnage ensues nthe troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer a distress call nmore carnage ensues nafter being rescued their plans are changed to capture a brain bug which is believed to be controlling the aliens battle plans look i didnt write this ok nyet more carnage ensues nget the picture ninterspersed throughout all this are brief ads from the federal network which present the picture of a neofascist state much like in verhoevens robocop nthere are many problems with starship troopers nthe plot where one exists to drive the movie onwards is silly nharris star of tvs doogie howser md is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie apparently so we will accept his ability to mindmeld with a brain bug later on nin addition the first thirty minutes of the movie until the characters sign up for service drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills 90210 nthe characters are onedimensional so much so that when dizzy is killed she says its ok because she got to sleep with rico ni had hoped that verhoevens use of a noname cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience but such an idea appears to have escaped him nthe dialogue is embarassing and isnt helped by the frequently terrible delivery i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice a few hundred people for the good of the species nfinally the fake ads become a nuisance nalthough they evoke the propaganda of the wwiiera movietone reels as presumably they are meant to their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect nsome people will say all of thats irrelevant the movie hinges on the battle scenes nso what about those battle scenes nwell i admit the effects are good the bugs move about quite convincingly especially when they have been deprived of a few of their limbs nand people have their brains blown out their limbs cut off and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways nbut this is my problem nthe entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore and its continous attempt to gross us out starting early on when richards character vomits onscreen nverhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success but fails spectacularly nwhile robocop had a message about the importance of being human and gave the bad guys some motivation starship troopers lacks even these simple features nwhen the brain bug sucks out a characters brain near the end of the film its merely an analogy for what the film has done to us nthis film is full of graphic violence and is not suitable for children under 16 n
 the 44 caliber killer has struck again nstarring john leguizamo mira sorvino adrian brody jennifer esposito michael rispoli bebe neuwirth nrated r nsummer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lees abilities nlee is a great filmmaker often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg nbut here he gets himself into a bind nhis latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work nthe summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city nit was the hottest summer on record nto boot new yorks first serial killer was on the loose calling himself the son of sam david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population nso it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout people went berserk causing billions of dollars in damage to the city nthe movies focus is on a group of twentysomethings during that fateful summer vinny john leguizamo a clubhopping adultrous hairdresser his benevolent wife dionna mira sorvino looking young ritchie adrian brody a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters nwe follow them through their roller coaster lives thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings nvinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him make him stay faithful to her nritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more eccentric and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend ntensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sams first murder looms the night he promises he will strike again na local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects nat the top of the list is ritchie nvinny an unwilling part of the said group is called upon to set a trap for his friend nas we watch these proceedings some of which are painfully graphic the dreaded so what nquestion springs to mind nfrom the way this movie is made id have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find nlee touches on so much the media the 70s punk scene the details of the actual killings as well as the characters very personal dilemmas but he doesnt bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement nall is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable ntoo bad summer of sam doesnt get any help here nfrankly its a bore a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesnt entertain beyond its first half hour nthere is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague nleguizamos turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny nthe script makes it clear that were supposed to believe that his character is flawed but still a good guy nyoud never guess from his performance nadrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better nsorvino gives a riveting touching performance in a banal movie im tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane her character is affecting and her emotions truetoheart nbrody too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for nsummer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film it looks great it has a few notable performances and i suppose its pretty well directed in a purely technical way nbut its also empty pretentious and boring nlike last years the thin red line its a movie by a director who doesnt know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway n 1999 eugene novikov n
paul verhoeven the dutch auteur who dragged his violent sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film has never been what id consider a thoughtful director though some of his films notably starship troopers have been lauded as artistic achievements but he is the kind of hollywood film maker whos managed to no matter what the budget make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils nstarship troopers was essentially a bmonster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange a great film thats nearly impossible to find on video yet showgirls is everywhere in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards who may actually be 45 silicone in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage nits not a completely successful film but as a failure its certainly an interesting and mostly entertaining one nmy favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores spetters a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the subculture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange havent yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ni believe his best hollywood film to be robocop a bleak superhero satire with a robotic hero thats as touching as schwarzeneggers in t2 nthat movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics nits violence seemed to be there for a purpose namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience ntheres a jawdropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him nhe tortures the officer by taking glee in his victims every fearful tic nits a startling moment of barbaric maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punknoir nin hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just wont shut up he impales a coworker drowns another and so on nbut why nhis character is introduced as a smug genius the kind whos always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place though once the character becomes invisible this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster nthe kind who just wont die nhollow mans protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda elizabeth shue acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm and her lover a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin whos saddled with the films worst lines ive lost cohesion again ntheyre a typical aaron spelling couple goodlooking but as vacant as george w bushs republican national convention speech i e nbush referring to clinton so much promise but to what end nto what end nthis actually got applause nsuddenly warren beatty doesnt look so absurd nthe rest of the films characters are all well past thirty though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained oneliners is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywoods new character developing technique nahh what a cynical time we live in nas the picture opens we meet cain kevin bacon an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentations project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility for what purpose is never hinted at ntheyve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine in a twist worthy of the films 1950s late show origins to impulsively experiment on himself ncaine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his coworkers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead nour mad scientist is turned invisible after several fxheavy complications then he inexplicably its hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures but this is never explored and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human nbegins raping assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger nit grows abundantly clear with each new release that its verhoevens films that have become hollow nlike the rest this one is cold heartless and full of contempt for humanity but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit insight and makes no statement other than audiences will pay for anything these days nits an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun thrillaminute ride nverhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care nthe previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick nhow can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self na couple weeks ago after seeing the trailer a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability nhollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa in a serious manner to boot nbut oh yeah it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway nverhoeven delivers the sleazy goods but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner here it just feels icky and uncomfortable nthe director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses caressing their breasts with his lens all while fauxpsycho music strains in the background nits plainly obvious that verhoeven isnt exploring voyeurism like in the classic peeping tom but exploiting it and not even doing that very well nits funny that with all the technology 90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a womans naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand nmost vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks nin fact its largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since by the end most of his potential victims don inferred glasses that track his body heat nas in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked nthe film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy nit happens when a lab assistant kim dickens who looks like she stepped out of playboy in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon suddenly pauses n are you looking at me she queries obviously haunted nits a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 the apex of the mad slasher craze nthose special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer nand theyre the only reason to check out hollow man preferably as a midweek bargain rental nyouve been warned nbut you probably wont listen will you ntis a pity n
 varsity blues is the best film of 1999 thus far nunfortunately it is also the first film i have seen from 1999 nit is another one of those smalltown sports movies that involves a flawed but goodheartedfrom 1999 nit is another one of those smalltown sports movies that involves a flawed but goodhearted protagonist a rough and meanspirited coach and the big game nby the end will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph nwill everyone in the town turn against the coach nwill the team win the climactic game ndo cats bathe themselves regularly nthe socalled hero in question is john moxin james van der beek a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the deadend town nat least hes got the right idea since west canaan texas is portrayed in the film as frankly pathetic with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming nheck in one scene the front page of the towns newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers big win the night before nwhen the teams star quarterback is severely injured tearing the ligaments in his leg john finds himself taking over as the teams leader but his few minutes of glory do not last long as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend amy smart when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ali larter nand after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics the team loses their secondtolast game putting john at feuds with the coach jon voight who like gary oldman is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the bad guy nworse yet the coach is threatening to ruin johns scholarship chances if the badgers dont win their final game nthe plotting of varsity blues is as old as the hills and contains every cliche in the book nadmittedly i was never exactly bored while i was watching it but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained nthroughout all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983s all the right moves none of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were least of all certainly not john who played by van der beek of tvs dawsons creek is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities nwhile i probably shouldnt blame this on van der beek since the inauspicious and bythenumbers screenplay by w peter iliff isnt of any help he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in all the right moves nthe story revolving around john meanwhile is extemely thin throughout particularly for its 104minute running time and it alternates between uninspired comic relief as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club and heavyhanded melodrama nthe romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot but we also learned very little about her which is unfortunate since amy smart whom i dont think ive seen before in past films is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence nsmart does not allow her character to become the passive girlfriend instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions nits too bad the camera didnt linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts nthe adult characters probably fare the worse of any since they all must play residents of a dimwitted town that cares about nothing but football njohns relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance nhis father is set on him becoming a football player at a university but john doesnt want any part of that nhis mother stands beside her big strong husband and is a passive female nfinally jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than onedimensional nsaving varsity blues from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences including one set in the sex education class which did get a laugh out of me nthe scenes of playing football were wellshot and thankfully didnt overstay their welcome as many sports films fall victim to nbut leaving the theater the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ni seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood ndo we really need another highschool sports film nno we dont and certainly not one of this lowcaliber which felt like a cutandpaste job of spare parts from much better but similar films n varsity blues no doubt is the first one however to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts n
a fullyloaded entertainment review website coming soon nhunter s thompsons fear and loathing in las vegas written in 1971 is already an american classic not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the postpsychedelia of the 1960s but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as gonzo nsoon after the book was written hunter s thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke nand that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas the movie nalthough the book is one of my favorites i now agree with thompsons own assessment of the novel as unfilmable nthe main problem is that the book although detailing wild drug use and trippedout adventures was not written on the road nit was written and edited by hunter s thomspons relatively sober at his home nso although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor nhunter s thomspon the narrator while always drugged out still has a grip on reality and can still tell with journalistic ability what is going on around him nnot so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas ndespite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped the movie is an exact duplicate of the book in terms of dialouge nunfortunately this can get annoying in the form of johnny depps who plays thompson excessive narration nand the characters while having vivid personalities are played as 2d characers on the screen dr raoul duke johnny depp the name raoul duke was an alias of thompsons and his riding companion dr gonzo benicio del toro who is a large samoan lawyer have no personalities or emotions at all save for stoned nthe film is very faithful to the plot what there is of the book in that dr raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400 and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs nfrom there one set of stoned adventures after another happens including one of the few good scenes in which depp high on acid watches all the people in the bar around him turn into literally lounge lizards nwhile the movie has its moments few it is almost unwatchable at parts especially towards the end ndespite a lot of celebrity cameos the stars never get off the ground nthe set decoration and costumes are great and probably deserve an oscar nomination nhowever as we all know its not sets or effects that make a movie its the characters and quite frankly these characters are no good n
she was the femme in la femme nikita nhe was the baldwin in backdraft sliver and fair game with cindy crawford ntogether anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make shattered image the biggest piece of hooey since the stallonestone thriller the specialist nthe film poses the question what if the life youre living now is really a dream and your dreams reality nits either about a woman whos haunted by a recurring and recurring and recurring nightmare that shes a hired assassin or its about a hired assassin whos haunted by a recurring and recurring and recurring nightmare that shes honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica nit doesnt much matter and believe me by the time shattered image runs its painful and pedestrian course you wont care nthese two lives with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig black emotionless eyes and black leather clothing in the seattlebased assassin scenes and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is its now twice as boring as it might have been nits not that complicated plots cant be entertaining nof course it helps if you have interesting characters crisp dialogue and a modicum of style n shattered image isnt complex its just stupid nand boring nparillaud and baldwin who arent exactly shakespearean material to begin with are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines nlines like n you dont beg you insist ni like that in a woman nthats parillauds character talking nto her cat nand n youre not the reason i couldnt care less about you nhuh nand this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film n if you give me a couple of minutes you know ill charm the pants off you n i dont have that kind of time ntalking of pants parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say point of no return nwe have come to expect this from billy baldwin but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first nbut theres nothing to learn nkaren is as interesting as a cereal box a someonesouttogetme crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone the stranger who sends her flowers maybe even her husband himself is her wouldbe killer nsiouxsie is the chromium cool toughasnails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the films meaningless stock title nbaldwin seems more interested in parillauds nest egg so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot than he does in her neach time graham greene shows up he gets killed nbarbet schroeder reversal of fortune coproduced and should be ashamed of himself nevery now and again its fun to watch a really bad movie nand every now and again as shattered image makes agonizingly clear it isnt n
even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality nlike everyone else dreyfuss has bills to pay so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies nconsequently while his career highlights include jaws close encounters of the third kind stakeout and tin men his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador let it ride and now krippendorfs tribe nlet me start out by saying that krippendorfs tribe is occasionally funny although never riotously so but thats about its only asset nthe best word to describe this film is asinine nthe target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes which are aimed at someone going through puberty nkrippendorfs tribe tries to be a zany offthewall comedy but the film makers have forgotten three important rules nthe first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist nthe second is that viewers should be able to identify with or at least care about a character or two nfinally and most importantly more than 5 of the jokes have to work nonce upon a time james krippendorf dreyfuss was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college nhe and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a lost tribe somewhere in the wilds of new guinea a goal which they never accomplished nshortly after their return from the failed trip krippendorfs wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children shelly natasha lyonne mickey gregory smith and edmund carl michael linder on his own nnow over a year later the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf which he has spent not on research but on things for his family so they send a new member of their faculty professor veronica micelli jenna elfman to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings nwhen he arrives at the college for the momentous event rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe the shelmikedmu nto provide video footage he films his children dressed in native garb nsoon much to krippendorfs surprise the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon nbut one disaffected professor lily tomlin is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud nthe only way krippendorfs tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters not to mention the viewers are dumber than dirt nunfortunately its impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this ndirector todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags nmeanwhile attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture i e how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend come across as feeble and derivative nthe acting in underwhelming ndreyfuss has definitely not given his all to the role of james krippendorf nalongside him jenna elfman the spunky costar of tvs dharma and greg radiates perkiness and little else nthis quality while fine for a 22minute television program quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a featurelength movie nno one in the supporting cast lily tomlin david ogden stiers natasha lyonne woody allens daughter in everyone says i love you excels ni know that a movies in trouble when its half the length of titanic but seems much longer nmost of what comes on screen is generic sitcom level material the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set nif theres any upside its that i dont see much boxoffice support developing for this lame illmarketed miscue nkrippendorfs tribe will quickly become extinct n

martial arts master steven seagal not to mention director has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights talks in a hushed tone and squints at any sign of danger nhes also the most consistent individual in hollywood today since all his movies suck nthey basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art that is martial art nim sure the guys good and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows although a tad haughty but these movies he makes are all the same a guy who is basically indestructable is maybe wounded supposedly mortally then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses although i kinda liked under siege nof course this one as a change has a message that is drilled into our mind of ncourse after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people nso why do i watch his crap ni usually dont ni will never and you can hold me to this i will never pay to see this mans movies unless and only unless hes in a supporting role i e n executive decision and id definitely pay if he dies i e n executive decision nbut this one has a special place in my heart nthis doesnt mean its good or that i even liked it nthis was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la mystery science theatre 3000 and this was a couple years before i had heard of mystery science theatre 3000 nin this one seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greasedup typical shallow villain this time played by an oscarwinner to give the movie some more clout michael caine nit seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land naround the 2030 minute point seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs what with his new fire down below another message film and caine has him bumped off or ndoes he nseagal is rescued by some inuits and falls in love with one of them played by joan chen who can act hypothetically but for some reason not here none of caines cliched henchmen played here with a lot of overacting by john c mcginley shoots the cheif of the inuit clan and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory literally nof course nat one point seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesnt have any options but blow stuff up nhe even goes as far as to say i dont want to kill someone and in the same breath he asks some guy where the arsenal is ni have no problem with violence nim a huge john woo fan but he paints his films with suspense skill style depth characterization and just plain cool violence nin the films of seagal the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly and him either wounding or killing them nat some points they use the cliche of the talking villain where the villain has the advantage can shoot seagal but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan or saying a corny line to which seagal says something hokey back and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them and does nthis would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didnt take itself seriously at all like in the case of this summers con air nbut seagal is serious about his skill and of course his message ni wouldnt mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence nbut seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle not pounded into the viewers mind nthe villain is totally shallow and cartoonish thus we cant take him and his motives seriously and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig and kills some workers who were just doing his job nthen at the end he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech just in case you didnt get the message from the trailers nwhat seagal doesnt realize is that no one takes his films seriously although maybe a couple do and any message he has is no only redundant but doesnt comfortably fit in his film which is filled to the brim with hokey violence crap suspense stupid melodrama and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish nas far as seagal and his acting hes rather boring nhe squints he kills nperiod nnothing else noh yeah theres corny oneliners im gonna reach out and touch someone nof course hes the star and were supposed to root for him and all so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks nmichael caine whos a great actor is just supposed to yell and look cold nhe does it well i guess but this is no alfie nof coure no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him nhis big henchman john c mcginley is kinda boring as well but is not horrible nand we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid r lee ermey from full metal jacket as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is just for the movie trailers and for seagals ego nand also look for billy bob thornton as one of ermeys assasins nanyway to conclude this all to judge one of seagals movies is to judge all of them except for under siege and executive decision though the latter is not really a seagal movie nthey all have this same formula they all have the same action same villain same plot but this one has that message which makes it more excrucitating to watch ni mean if you do rent it and i dont reccomend you do make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes nbut i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one nmy extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock n
the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john mayburys love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon nas always jacobis acting is impeccable but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque nthe movie convincingly argues that francis played by jacobi was a completely despicable and vain individual but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude nwhen interviewed by a fawning talk show host francis calls his style chance brushstrokes nstarting with a burglary of franciss flat the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie nthe camera shots are heavy on the avantgarde angles lots of wideangle closeups and distorted shots filmed through coloredglass reflections nthe director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man ndaniel craig in a lifeless performance plays the burglar and boxer george dyer nwhen francis lays eyes on him after the breakin francis promises not to call the police if hell stay for sex nhe stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed nhe thinks that franciss paintings have no bloody use and the movie presents no counterargument nwriter maybury barely outlines franciss character and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma nwe learn little of george other than franciss reason for liking him georges amorality and innocence nfranciss love of sadomasochism is shown early and often n boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match nas the fighters head is sliced open with a heavy blow the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood nfrancis appears to be in complete ecstasy nanother of franciss favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities nas the carnage mounts we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience nin a film that tries obsessively to shock one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident nfranciss mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother the father and the boy nsometimes the script throws us tidbits of franciss wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful n im optimistic by nature nim optimistic about nothing n loneliness is my only true companion nwe learn more details about franciss makeup techniques than about the man himself nhe prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth nfull of metaphorical interpretations the films best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom nmistaking franciss picture of a toilet for the genuine article he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly nlike a parody of a bad art house movie love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling nby the end the audience hasnt learned any more than it could have in a threeminute sketch nlove is the devil runs 1 30 nthe film is not rated but should be considered nc17 for violence profanity graphic sex nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers n
heres a concept jeanclaude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie nnow if that isnt enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie i dont know what is nall sarcasm aside it is certainly a different way to start a movie of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother so lucky us we get to see more of jeanclaude nvan damme 1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives nvan damme 2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after 1 gets killed in france nthe remaining twin the french cop goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death nonce there he hooks up with his deceased brothers girlfriend played by natasha henstridge and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are njeanclaudes acting abilities dont seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie nin other words just in case you missed the sarcasm his acting is worse than normal non the upside natasha henstridge is in this film and she does what she did best in species she gets naked nsadly this is probably the high point in the movie nshe is actually a decent actress but didnt improve as much as i thought she would after species nthis is the typical van damme movie with jeanclaude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents nnothing new here and certainly nothing we havent seen in every other van damme movie nsimply put there is absolutely nothing new about this movie nit has a retread plot this isnt the first time jeanclaude has played twins nhe still cant act nwe all saw natashas breasts in species although this is one repeat performance im not complaining about nthis is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in sub par n

the working title for no looking back was long time nothing new and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture neven though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics nwriterdirector edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasnt spent their life in seclusion ninstead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way nno looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful nthe most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide and the sooner the better nalas thats not the case and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio nand to further depress audiences burns has shot the entire film on cold rainy days in a gray new york state beach town npeeks of sunshine are few and far between nno wonder the characters are all so miserable nfirst of all we have charlie burns a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home nthat girlfriend is claudia lauren holly and after picking up the pieces of her life following charlies departure she has moved on shacking up with one of charlies old school buddies mike jon bon jovi nthe two have a comfortable relationship but its apparent to even a blind person that theyre not right for each other nclaudia years for some spice in her life mike wants to settle down and have children nthen charlie reenters the mix nso who if anyone will claudia end up with nwho cares nno looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that were not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle nso what if no one finds happiness these characters dont deserve it anyway especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time nthey arent real people theyre a writers construct stumbling through a tooobvious storyline nthey should know the ending as well as we do nand burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two nanother frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentiallyinteresting supporting characters nblythe danner is solid as claudias housebound mother connie britton is suitably highstrung as claudias neurotic sister and jennifer esposito is eyecatching as a bartender in search of a little romance nsadly all we get is quick glimpses into their lives although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell nnone of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes nedward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here njon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career but he could still use a little polish nthe worst case is lauren holly who presents a completely bland claudia nas portrayed here shes hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moments interest not to mention undying love nburns ex the monumentally untalented maxine bahns would have been hardpressed to do a less inspired job nwhen he released the brothers mcmullen edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival robert redford has apparently stuck with him the aging actordirector executive produced this mess ntwo films and three short years later the luster has faded nsome movie makers have only one good film in them nwith back toback duds like shes the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers burns is beginning to look like a member of that undistinguished club n
synopsis sullen julie james still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas narriving at the start of the hurricane season julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize theyve walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand ncomments i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series party of five ni am only vaguely aware of the shows premise and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i halfpaid attention to while watching the tube n party of five i do know however seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre nneve campbell scream queen of the 90s and star of scream scream 2 and the craft is a regular of the show nso too is jennifer love hewitt nlo and behold following in the footsteps of campbell hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own the i know what you did last summer line nthough the original film released last year was watchable enough this insipid sequel had me looking at the theaters glowing red exit sign longingly throughout njennifer love hewitt is a very goodlooking young leading lady however unlike neve campbell hewitt struggles with acting nshe just isnt convincing in this film and she wasnt in the original either nthis puts many young males including myself in a paradoxical quandary shes very attractive but the annoying spoiled valley girltype character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize exploitatively her figure nadd to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy another rising teen tv star and you get one frustrated male audience nive spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason ni still know what you did last summer though cashing in on the success of the original ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses nnothing else here is original or interesting nthis movie in fact makes other recent soso horror films like urban legend and john carpenters vampires seem like stunning works of high art ni still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches an isolated location a storm parentless teenagers false alarm nightmares lots of bluelighted darkness scenes a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere etc you get the picture nthe entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killers hook nthey may as well have huge targets painted on them nlike scream and its numerous knockoffs these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief nunfortunately i still knows characters arent all that funny nin particular one character a chainweedsmoking guy is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesnt die soon enough nthe death scenes by the way are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film nseveral of them are uncomfortable to watch and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser bloodline a truly sadistic movie nthis too did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for nand what is the deal with the slasher himself ni know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror ncome on the guy looks like the gortons fisherman and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate nthough his lightninglit appearances ellicited muchneeded laughter in the theater his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film and thats really saying something nso all thats left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy nboth prance about in tightfitting revealing outfits or in various states of undress yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene nhewitt however does do a postshower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite n n titillating nthis scene alone made this onestar turkey earn two stars under my rating system notherwise hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves nearly in the film for instance brandy wins the trip to the bahamas nshe and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever ni needed extrastrength tylenol after that part noh and the films conclusion talk about repetitive npeople who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still knows ending at least 5 minutes before it happens nboring ni saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater nadmission is only one dollar on wednesdays and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them nits usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience who dont seem to mind participating in a mass mystery science theater 3000 type viewing ni still know what you did last summer however produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience underscoring how bad it really is nif it werent for the main actresses revealing wardrobes id have had a very very hard time sitting through this lame sequel ni cant imagine trying to watch it on video horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation and wouldnt recommend it to people unless theyre horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy ni read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works nwhat a depressing thought nhewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act nrated r this film contains lots of violence several gory scenes and a couple nubile horny teenagersthough the sex act itself is always thwarted nid say this is unsuitable for kids but teens wouldnt have a problem sitting through it especially since they obviously compose the films target audience n
five years after his directorial debut based on stephen kings writings called the shawshank redemption 910 writerdirector frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king nunlike the latter film this one is a big long laborious bore nplot a sevenfoot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers ncritique this film is slow drawnout boring uninteresting unexciting predictable and topped with a couple of onedimensional evil characters nits only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles nthe real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about nof course much like all other death row cell blocks this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be misunderstood except for one cookiecutter crazy guy who is evil personified nand lets not forget all the guards on death row who also happen to be angels from the heaven above except for one cookiecutter crazy guard who is also evil personified and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates nam i supposed to identify with anyone in this film nor even more importantly am i supposed to give a rats ass about anyone in this film nwell if i was i sure missed that boat because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin nfurthermore there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyones life to present this story nin fact the story is empty within itself ni truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not nwow nhow interesting nthe plots utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie nwhip out those thinking caps kids nhmmm and i wonder what will happen to those two cookiecutter evil guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity nhmmmm now think hard here boys and girls nwhat a crock ni am guessing that this film was supposed to be some threehour exercise in spirituality but unfortunately for me it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging nin fact it was one big bore ni didnt see the point of the movie i didnt see the point of the story and i certainly didnt see the point in tom hanks big doublechin nall in all a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour john coffey ngive that man an award or something n
from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong nat reagan high four girls are sitting on top of the world ncourtney shane played by rose mcgowan holds the title of meanest most disrespectful soul in the school neveryone hates her but everyone envies her due to her popularity ncourtney is the leader of her clique which also includes julie played by rebecca gayheart liz purr played by charlotte roldan and marcie played by julie benz are the other three in the group nit is lizs seventeenth birthday and julie courtney and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her but the prank results in the death of liz njust like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else nand also just like in other teen directed movies one of the four dont agree with hiding it this time that character being julie nand finally just like in other teen movies there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth nthis time that character being fern mayo judy greer who is subject to many cracks from courtneys group as well as the entire school nfrom here jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge bad morals and at least trying to do the right thing nnot only is the script weak on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast njudy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional annoying character as she overacts every line she has nalso on the bad side of acting is julie benz almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers non the positive side of acting rose mcgowan performs well here but doesnt match her wickedly clever performance as tatum in 1996s scream nmcgowans role is annoying but this only adds to the film nshe is wickedly mean and even though she a wellwritten character you downright hate her nfaring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart who is always exceptionally believable as her roles nwhen the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character she turns it into three always putting strong emotion and power into her roles ngayheart isnt given as much to do here as she was in 1998s urban legend but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker njawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in nwe get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident and get into things that dont have anything to do with the actual film nthe beginning and ending are strong its just the middle that needs a lot of help nduring the body of the movie it is undeniably repetitive never progressing towards a conclusion nnothing to grab the viewers interest is around and the same extremely annoying song plays over and over again njawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless but falls flat nthe few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang nall in all a horrible disappointment nthe bottom line the tagline reads even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside nyes that is too true nno matter how good this film may have looked it fails to deliver n

soldier is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesnt have jean claude van damme in it ni could liken it to the scifi cheese that was the hollywood productofchoice back in the early 80s but that would be too much of a compliment nif there is a movie theater in hell this film is playing there 24 hours a day nthe story such that there is revolves around todd kurt russell an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a nottoodistant ultraconservative future is there any other kind nafter years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy nwho the enemies in these wars are is never revealed but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesnt matter because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys nafter ten minutes of this nihilistic trash yes folks theres more we see todd as a buff scarred adult now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat ntheres a new wrinkle though ntodd and his brethren are declared obsolete and a new batch of soldiers takes their place nafter losing a sanctioned battle with dragons jason scott lee the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying icecube tray well thats what is looked like on a remote garbage planet nif you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them youre way ahead of the game nthe renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you halfexpect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute nits surprising that soldier is the brainchild of blade runner cowriter david webb peoples nunlike that mindtwisting classic this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three doublespaced pages nadd into the mix the mortal kombats paul anderson inept direction and its easy to see how soldier turned out so bad nand the special effects nremember the flying steam irons in hardware wars ngary busey is in this movie nnuff said nsoldier is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults nthat this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all nnow if youll excuse me i have to go weep for the future n
so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful scifi films such as close encounters of the third kind 2001 a space odyssey apollo 13 and contact nwell whatever it is youd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange considering the disastrous results were left with here nthis is a film that takes a little bit of everything but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing nits like i said this nmovie sucks nplot a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet ncritique extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie nuneven would be another nthe trailer for this movie actually showed some promise the buzz around it had been soso and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes all leading you to believe that its actually going to go somewhere nbut it isnt long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherrycolored planet tries too hard to get us into the pain of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix nin a scifi movie nwell i dont know much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half only to figure out some big secret in the end a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement nultimately this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise joins the crew in their misadventures in space for the main crux of its journey and eventually settles down for one of the most anticlimactic endings this side of contact nmind you if you enjoyed that films shrugoftheshoulders ending you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well nof course i dont remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story nugh nwhat a friggin mess nfilms like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again ndidnt anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ndidnt they read the bad dialogue the cheezy lines the obvious derivative nature of the work mind you with a director like depalma at the helm that aint saying much nof course you cant really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry oconnell in this fine crew of thespians nnuff said nneither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the films musical score during the last fifteen minutes presumably in order to wake the audience up okay we get it brian this scene is supposed to be powerful wow yawn my nears hurt nso is anything salvageable in this movie nsure ngary sinise does another great job as does cheadle the film doesnt completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening and yes the sandtwister effect that you see in the commercial is well done nother than that ni guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies oops ndid i say admire i meant am disgusted nall in all this movie delivers very little in actual substance offers twobit dialogue masked in a lot of scifi mumbojumbo pretends to be deep when really its just sappy and eventually just settles into an ending which other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck ngo see the ninth gate now ntheres a great movie nand on a personal note i think its time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12minute uninterrupted film sequences and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting n
these days people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run n1970s nostalgia is already wearing off and now people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s nfew years in the future early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia nhowever i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period none of the reason would surely be films like national lampoons loaded weapon 1 that in many ways symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry lack of originality and ideas nbeing made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series this film pairs two l a policemen jack colt emilio estevez burnout alcoholic cop on the edge and wes luger samuel l jackson bythebook policeman days away from retirement ntwo of them following the murder of lugers ex partner must confront evil general mortars william shatner crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies nthe authors of this films whose director gene quintano worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects and that reflects in the lack plot characters and even original lines nthe plot or what goes for the plot in this movie is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years apart from lethal weapon series this film borrows its female lead from basic instinct nthe best gags are same as with many other similar movies shown in the trailers nthe rest simply doesnt work nonly those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh nothers would probably wince at the lameness of humour nsome would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while nbut at the end spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort nthe film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones nthe authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel n
in the continuation of warner brothers franchise joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow nwhat makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film navika goldsmans screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another nthis coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as the client is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke nsituations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another nthis is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstones batgirl who just happens to be alfreds niece nthe story of dr victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought nwhile working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife dr freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment nnow of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live nnow the logic of that little subplot escapes me nif mr freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth nthis is indeed a cold hearted man nthe development of poison ivy is no less contradictory nshe wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal nshe joins with mr freeze in his plan to start a new ice age destroying all animal life therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them nthe characters have no logic nbatman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films nnow that he has an adoptive son in burt ward robin bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships while at the same time not really

there was for nicole kidmans psychologist in batman forever between bruce and anyone other than alfred nand even that relationship is very reserved nrobin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series nnow hes just a spoiled kid nin batman forever burt ward wanted to be batmans partner and friend nnow robin is suffering from ego deficiency nrobins attraction for poison ivy is not believable except for a boy around the age of 15 nhis later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest even though they are not related in a traditional sense nchris odonnell once considered a rising star successfully burns up on reentry with this performance nhis robin needs nothing more than a good spanking nthe less said about alicia silverstones performance the better nthis talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film nshe was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it nthis brings us to the villains narnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday nthe most rediculous scene is during mr freezes imprisonment nthe guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film nits almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member numu thurman struts and coos her way through her part showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status nher poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in sextette 1978 nthe only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough nthese two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film nwithout going through the intricacies of the plot there is one question that always comes to mind with this series except for the first batman and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel nmr freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video nevery villain even the minor ones have to have a look no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume nwith this film warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to its tv incarnation nthe only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows ngwaaaas and clangs associated with the old series nyou almost wonder if william dozier producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film nthe special effects by john dykstra and production design by barbara ling are the primary stars of this film nand it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing nevery set from ivys lair the batcave to freezes hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come nthere is no one realistic set or set piece in the film neverything is set for maximum exposure nthe special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have nthere are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on the time machine the growing plant scene but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured njoel schumacher has directed the film with no flair ncamera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series nmaster shots pepper the action scenes destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had nmr schumacher is a good director none just has to look back on the films the lost boys cousins an underrated film and the client to know that nbut batman and robin comes off as a mated made for tv movie nthe film has no style of individuality nit is the cinematic equivalent to jello pretty to look at but empty nit is unfortunate that this film even with its surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warners thought tim burton would do with the franchise nkill it njoel schumachers batman robin is loud colorful action packed and ultimately nboring nstars n
i have never been so confused after watching a movie n meet joe black is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year with a cinematography music and cast that will dazzle most of us nat the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season nat first you marvel at the elegant direction graceful cinematography and sensual musical score nthen youll wait for something to happen for half an hour but when you finally understand whats going on youll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this nthe script is simply a silly and unresolved story which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture nit feels like an eternity nmost of the time it is a pompous soap opera filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and meaningful winks nthe film is based on alberto caesellas play death takes a holiday nthe story concentrates around bill anthony hopkins who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying yes nsoon he meets a young elegant gentlemen brad pitt who introduces himself as death nit is bills time nbut death has other plans nit has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive nour bill is chosen to be deaths guide and in exchange he gets time nbill introduces death as joe black who immediately becomes the center of everyones attention nbills business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bills side lives in his house and resides at his office nthat is not all however nbills youngest daughter susan claire forlani falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her nthis relationship is bound to have some serious consequences nit wouldnt be fair to say that this film didnt have some interesting moments such as the scene where joe is invited to join bills family for dinner nwhen joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love the experience is somewhat different nit is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure nits one thing to say wouldnt it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth nto create a motion picture out of this is another nfour screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic nit is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film non the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest scent of a woman nhopkins looks great in any role and no matter how shallow or hollow it is he will complete it nhis talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment nbut pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time nhow can you play death in human form nto me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters nthey are not creatures but phenomenas nsaying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form nhandling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work nspeaking in a calm soft voice portraying death as a lonely distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters nhe looks and acts more like an angel of death rather than a demon or a redeyed executioner nclaire forlani and others are also fine stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits nunfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery nin other words this is not what i expected from the director of scent of a woman nit could and should be better with such cast and crew nin the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera n
supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898 njohn patterson val kilmer the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation tried to rid his operation of the lions but fails na world renound hunter remington michael douglas is called in and the battle man against lion begins nthis film has a great soundtrack and wonderful scenery nthe acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin nwe only see one side of each character nkilmer is a bridge builder and thats all we see him as nthese lions kill dozens of his men and he doesnt even appear to be too upset about it nand the plot nits jaws but with lions nagain were presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should nit appears to kill men because it just likes too nwhy nwho knows ni guess there wouldnt be much of a story if it didnt nthe problem is that there isnt much of a story even though it does n
 gordy is not a movie it is a 90minutelong sesame street skit and a very bad one at that nthis movie is so stupid and dumb that its depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie nim sure children are the target audience of this movie but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it nit is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy voiced by garms whose family has been taken away to up north which we know means death nof course we can hear the animals talk to each other and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible nactually its almost funny in a way nthe only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears a little girl named jinnie sue macallister young who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him njinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it nwhat is the point of this nmaybe she is one of the producers relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something nwe then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce roescher who is sad because his divorced mother is dating nhe leaves the party and meets jinnie sue but he accidentally falls in a pool probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a 200 suit on nah didnt see that one coming nstarts to drown and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him nif this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hanks grandfather the original ceo dies and leaves his fortune to hank nand gordy nof course there must be a villain but even this villain donadio as sipes isnt that evil nhe never raises his voice or becomes angry and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story nits hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film or if the filmmakers are just this untalented and stupid nat times gordy is tolerable to watch thus earning it one star and not the dreaded z nbut its just so unbelievably boring cliche dumb unfunny corny and just plain bad it may scare children it certainly disturbed me n 42196 12997 61397 see also babe n
a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings nfamily breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in handwringing detail nstill i cant recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love nand after it i still cant nbye bye love is rarely funny more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tvmovie fare nonly a few moments which have nothing to do with the films main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion nbye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children ndave matthew modine a father of two is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend vic randy quaid is a foulhumored father of three about to go on a rare date donny paul reiser pines for his exwife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma eliza dushku nover the course of the weekend the three men face various crises including vics blind date from hell janeane garofolo and donnys growing estrangement from emma nthe three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality nrandy quaid is the best of the three bitter without being irritating gleefully spiteful without being frightening nhis runins with is exwife lindsey crouse are a bit overplayed though and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist rob reiner is gimmicky and implausible nhe does get bye bye loves best subplot a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo and he does a great slow burn npaul reiser really has only one character his slightly befuddled uptight nice guy mad about you persona but he does it well nas a personality he is appealing but as a character he becomes pretty boring here nmatthew modine is quite simply terrible nthis isnt a performance good enough to be called mailedin he even forgot to put a stamp on it nmodine lacks any charm in an appallingly underwritten role looks bored most of the time and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how its all his fathers fault hes such a cad ncarolcos executives whose entire future is resting on modines bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island must be sweating buckets right now nbye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids making it just another dating in the 90s movie nwhen the movie does deal with the children at all it is to have one of them scream out an accusation andor cry perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug perhaps not neven more confusing is a subplot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonalds and befriends a troubled youth nit is a sad end to flanders career getting caught up in a truly annoying overuse of mcdonalds as a location a plot device and apparently a major advertiser neven if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parentchild relationships it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family breakups and their effects on children nany way you slice it it is a bad situation for kids and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue nit is left to the dads romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is and it isnt enough nthere have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching nbye bye love is a genuine shame n

yeah yeah the advertisements didnt even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook sex nneve campbell and starship troopers denise richards getting it on nok nyeah its a decent two minutes of film erotica but even if thats your main interest in this film theres plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes nwild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however nnearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing or at least curious to see the next turn throughout the entire movie nbut this fastpaced razorsharp turning of events doesnt leave much time to enjoy the surprises nwe start off in a highclass california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making nguidance counselor sam lombardo matt dillon seems to catch the eye of every student particularly kelly van ryan richards daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts nright off the bat kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce mr lombardo nthe fundraiser car wash seems the opportune time particularly when you wash your guidance counselors jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure youll be soaked from head to toe when youre done non the weekend of the car wash kellys attempts at seduction fall flat and when they do she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day nnaturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations nbut the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a lowclass marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller campbell comes forth with a near identical story also involving her trusted guidance counselor npitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney ken bowden played by bill murray nyes that bill murray nsound like a good complete movie nyes that alone could have been but this is just the beginning nin fact the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film nit is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time nby the time the movie finishes you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable nunfortunately with so much going on youre not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about nthis is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it couldve been nthe 113 minutes fly by and although it never feels underdeveloped this pretzel of storytelling couldve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken nthe acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox primetime soap operas which no is not a good thing nand its not just campbell who happens to hail from the primetime fox soap party of five but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones ndillon who was so charming in his understated role in last years in out gives the best performance and murrays surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film nin fact if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy even if it was the exact same film i would actually give it a better grade nthats how cheezy it comes off nbut aside from these two the rest offer nothing more than some good eyefulls nin the right hands wild things couldve been a wickedly delightful scrumptiously twisted thriller but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting nand whats up with these people passing as high school students ni realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles but when i realized it wasnt supposed to be a college they were at i had to snicker ni wont lie this is definitely a guilty pleasure nas corny as it is its got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a b for effort nbut if you just want to admire denise richards go for last years starship troopers which was every bit as campy but a million times better nof course if seeing her breasts is your most important goal youll be right at home with wild things nperhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters n

studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that its a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring cliched individual not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldnt be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio which they did according to this film nare we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it n 54 belongs in the elite group of films known as the big disappointments the films that attain so much hype andor so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished ni was heavily awaiting 54 not the least because ive become fascinated with the infamous club which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary thats been running all summer on vh1 which is weirdly enough much more intriguing and engrossing than this edgy film nperhaps more importantly 54 is part of the blossoming subgenre the 70s nostalgia film which has been picking up mighty steam what with boogie nights and the last days of disco coming out within the year and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period but brought us interesting and real characters like scotty the tragically gay boom mike operator from boogie nights and charlotte the ironically clueless and bitchy coprotagonist from the last days of disco not to mention several others n 54 deals not so much with the timeline of the studio how it began how it was run how it ended thats all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale but more interested in the characters who populated it nthis is a definite plus nheres a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases economy problems and perhaps worst of all reagan all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening nthe story of the studio is tragedy in itself lets look at how it all affected the people nbut this film doesnt let that happen nit gives us a halfassed protagonist named shane oshea ryan phillippe from i know what you did last summer whos chief character trait is the fact that hes from new jersey which also happens to be his chief character flaw i guess nhes dimwitted into being part of the scene and soon finds hes become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars a nbit like saturday night fever cept no travolta and no real interest put into him npoor poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting but all he is a halfassed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been nshane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club like anita salma hayek a wannabe donna sommers and her young hubby greg randanzo breckin meyer from clueless who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame nalthough he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster sela ward an exec of sorts he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black neve campbell and thus the boring romance subplot thats all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film nthe films sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the alltoo necesary personage of steve rubell played by mike myers you heard me nrubell the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation but the film thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers makes him out to be more than that nnotice the scenes sole shocking scene where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene and a couple others that some of us whove only seen him on tv never saw and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails nfirst time feature director mark christopher proves that hes a better director than a writer though not too terribly much nhis story is trite and shallow as are his characters and his direction is shockingly flat especially for a film about this subject nits as if he had a great story to tell but instead opted for the easier route nthe studios recreation is amazingly accurate though and very impressive but his direction is never captivating enough nsome people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in despite the films tone i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellinis la dolce vita and when i watched 54 i didnt particularly want to stay n

for his directoral debut gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent alcoholic husband and father and the various lives he affects nbut while the characters places and events may have special meaning to the writerdirector the audience is left in the dark nthe center of this tale is the abusive raymond ray winstone and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him nhe spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars nthen he returns home to his pregnant wife valerie kathy burke and their fiveyearold daughter nraymond demonstrates his violent tendencies and his paranoid delusions early on when he accuses valeries brother billy charlie creedmiles of stealing nraymond then proceed to beat and bite him to a bloody wreck nbut these are the least of billys problems nbilly is a heroin addict on the downturn and it doesnt seem that hell last much longer nbilly and valeries mother janet laila morse is raymonds nemesis nshe disapproves of him and he of her but is powerless to do anything about it nshe merely struggles on hoping her children will survive their respective torments nif this description seems bleak i havent told the half of it nthis is not a cheery movie and most of the time its downright depressing nwhile at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him in the end its not quite worth it nthere are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose ntake for example the extended sequence where one of billys scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy nthe film is filled with these character moments that never really achieve anything ngranted there are a few genuinely powerful and sickening moments in the film but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us nthe actors do a fine job particularly in the central roles nthe good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into nthe bad thing about an actor turned director is that theres no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices na good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience noldman got it about half right n

a new entry in the revisionist history genre of filmmaking dick suggests that two nottoobright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nations biggest presidential scandal nkirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlenes watergate hotel room accidentally stumble across g gordon liddy played deadon by harry shearer and the infamous breakin nwhen they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip they are ushered into a conference room questioned as to what they know and leave as official presidential dog walkers nthe girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with nwhen they discover that nixon another deadon performance by dan hedaya who actually favors nixon slightly unlike anthony hopkins has been abusive to checkers the presidential dog thanks to the conversations that he always recorded they quit and become disillusioned nduring a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein events are set into motion that eventually lead to the presidents resignation nthis film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry kingtype talk show featuring a cameo by french stewart about revealing the identity of deep throat nfrom there we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad dick joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy nat one point the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial nthe band manages to stop right as dunst screams you have to stop letting dick run your life nmuch to the horror of everyone standing within earshot nseveral other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film nif this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault its juvenile bathroom humor but its not nthe film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audiences throat in the least subtle way possible ni dont recall oliver stones nixon having to pander to its audience but of course that film wasnt a comedy aimed squarely at a 1320 yearold film going audience nthe only redeeming thing about this movie is its remarkable supporting cast ni wanted to see more of ferrell and mccullochs woodward and bernstein nthose two characters are the sole basis for my rating ni wish they had been given more screen time but unfortunately they are only relegated to the final halfhour ntheir constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight especially mccullochs constant thwarting of ferrells attempts to gather information from the girls who in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsys brother nthe other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters but are given nothing to work with nid like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities nas for the two leads dunst and williams can definitely do better nthey come off as what could best be described as romy and michele the early years in this particular film a highly dubious distinction at best nstay through the first half of the end credits though to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie nan excellent idea marred by poor execution dick could have been a great movie nless of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds nas it stands though dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as dick and poopie jokes nand that to me does not make a funny movie npg13 n

ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film i have a problem even regarding it as a film nits more of a show a big commercial for ted turners world championship wrestling wcw nthe movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page goldberg and sting nthe story is very minimal and basic nthere are these two guys gordy david arquette and sean scott caan nthey are two twentysomething wrestling fans from wyoming nwhen they go to a live event for the big match up there favorite wrestler jimmy king oliver platt is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus joe pantoliano ngordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus plans non the way they meet some people have some fun and clean up some portopotties nsounds great huh well its not nthe movie makes many attempts at humor only a few of them work nthe jokes that make you laugh however do not outnumber the films many duds nthere is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa nthe cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back ni especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquettes tag team partner is macho man randy savage nthey wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor nthe other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan nmcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl the cheerleaders of the wcw nshe becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowans breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face nnow what didnt work in this movie nthat would be the rest of it nthe flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets nthe two lead characters work for a portopotty cleaning company and when they crash the truck the excrements spill all over the road nits not funny its pathetic and brainless nthe film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way ni watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie nthe main characters in the film actually get to wrestle like that would happen to any fan especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set nalso i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily they just walked right in ni like wrestling ni watch it at home and laugh nits continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldnt watch it nthis movie wasnt even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv nthe only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew nthe funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently nthe movie was too dimwitted to be funny nit is possibly the most useless and underdeveloped film ever na recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film detroit rock city nthat movie was interesting well done and continuously funny unlike this film nthe acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh nnow that the scream trilogy is over arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1800callatt ads nat least he has a hot wife in courtney cox nhes in the funny parts of the film but there arent enough to make him look good nthe music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rocks bawitdaba and cowboy nmartin landau has a great cameo as a classic hardnosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne nscript is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin na fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it nat times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real nthe wrestlers form alliances go to peoples houses and beat them up nits utterly ridiculous nthe whole film was a wasteful dumfounding experience nthe movie was made to pay homage to the fans telling them things that made wrestling not the wrestlers nthe wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a pottyhumor movie nthe wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic twohour commercial to watch it nif youre going to watch wrestling watch wwf its actually entertaining nthe wrestling is betters theyre funnier more diverse and have better entrance themes noh and the girls are hotter nis this what movies have become 2 hourlong commercials that you have to pay to see ndont waste your money n
adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy the wedding singer nunfortunately that also has the effect of softening his edge nhes nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore not that it was much of one nhes certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot nthe year is 1985 letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia nadam sandler is nice guy robbie the titular wedding singer who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits nrobbies life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee linda angela featherstone leaves him at the altar nhowever things are looking up when he meets julia drew barrymore a waitress at the hall nshes the perfect woman but for one small flaw shes engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king glenn matthew glave nso most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love and his attempts to stop the wedding nas far as plots go its a pretty thin and tired one nto fill the gaps the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia nfrom boy george to michael jackson from miami vice to dallas from the first cds to the last rubiks cubes this film revels in all the minutiae nand then theres the music nlearning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank and romy and micheles high school reunion this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow nas a result most songs get maybe a lyric or a half but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives eyes the wedding singer vols n2 3 and 4 nwhile the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring at least they distract you from the plot nat least last years my best friends wedding stirred up the standard keep your true love from marrying someone else plot by making the rival a nice person nhere glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what julia saw in him nbarrymore on the other hand is simply charming as julia nwhich leaves us with adam sandler nhes at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception nwhen hes in full niceguy mode hes more pathetic than endearing nthe film boasts several cameos most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz nbut none of them work well at all nbuscemis role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous nlovitz on the other hand as a rival wedding singer makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live where he was actually funny nthe only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker during the films finale surprisingly one of the only plotrelated scenes which actually works nadam sandler still has some work to do before he can become a dependable leading man nwhile he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer the end result is no net gain n
director luis mandokis last film was the superb serious 1994 drama when a man loves a woman but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture message in a bottle which is the worst type of romance a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up neverything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times beforeand much betterso theres an absence of suspense and the film ultimately moves at such a very very deliberate pace as if it is trying to make great meaningful statements and plot developments that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through n message in a bottle begins with theresa osborne robin wright penn a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day ninside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and to her objection finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper nsoon a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks a boating town in north carolina to find out the specifics of the message nof course garrett turns out to be a handsome rugged man around theresas age and played by kevin costner nshe is immediately charmed by him but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there and finds that catherine was garretts late wife who died a few years earlier ndo you think you know where this is headed nmost likely you do and i wouldnt call it giving away anything to say that by the pictures end the movie has fallen into deep artificial melodrama that i didnt buy for a second nif there are any positive things to say about message in a bottle it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman as garretts stubborn but loving father are far above par to be in such a wasteful shaggy dog love story and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast and paints chicago as an equally alluring city nmeanwhile costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the lessthanstellar films that he has made recently nit seems that with such bad luck he wouldnt want to make another movie set near water but here he is again with one of the main and most ridiculous centerpieces set on a stormswept sea nthe other actors are all sadly wasted including illeana douglas an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the friend roles here playing penns confidante and coworker at the tribune nthe first half of message in a bottle plays like a humdrum trite television movie for the lifetime channel as theresa spends a great deal of time getting to know garrett with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining nusually i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogueladen sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt written and not as if people were really talking nwhen the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other and are not particularly interesting themselves you know immediately that you are in trouble ni swear that while watching message in a bottle i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater heck in actuality im not even familiar to the novel this is based on by nicholas sparks nalways one step ahead of the characters the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the triedandtrue hollywood melodrama the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing nnobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresas secret and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after nthis same exact problem occurred in last years very very similar watch this and you will realize just how similar i mean meg ryannicolas cage romantic drama city of angels nalthough theresa is deeply touched by the heartfelt letter that she finds in the bottle perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own preferably before filming began nit should have read memo to screenwriters use you brain n
therere so many things to criticize about i dont know where to start nrecommendation turn off your brain dont be like me decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much na comet is about to strike earth causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event e l e that wiped out the dinosaurs nwhat follows is the story of a presidents bid to think for the good of his people a rising reporter the love story of two teenagers one of whom discovered the comet and a team of astronauts on the ship messiah to save the world nfirstly there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film nor is there anything outstandingly good about it but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid nto be honest i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself which isnt saying much nmimi leders followup to the peacemaker is equally incompetent with all the big stars wasted n perhaps im just annoyed that the release of the peacemaker in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller the assignment nit is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives nhowever the film simply fails on that note nthe effects are wornout the substandard screenplay limited the acting and the director continued her sad run in terms of goodfilmmaking credentials nshes still making good money though nt a leonis unfortunate character the news reporter is the foundation of the story and of the cast nbut the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored nrobert duvalls aging astronaut is lifeless and morgan freemans president is restricted to well a righteous president which means hes not interesting at all nleonis character is the only appealing one and is played with reasonable conviction but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters nwarning spoilers included but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway nplot holes plot holes plot holes nnow e l e nis threatening to exterminate more than 99 of the human race and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there nwheres the logic nleder could have at least made it plausible with 20 nand then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish and those less selfish ones the ones that stayed at home were the victims nthe film was almost mocking them telling them they had died for nothing ni also fail to see how two teenagers carrying a baby would be the first to climb up the mountainhill even with a motorbike for a headstart nits unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle but that doesnt really matter nbuilding caves was a strategy mentioned in dr nstrangelove which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years nnow that is a more practical use for caves nwhat is the point of living in caves nthere is no unlike dr nstrangelove any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure nhow do plants grow nif humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves theres no reason why they cant do it in the open nthe president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves nobviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago and you cant be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media nin an important mission like that of the messiah for that matter any mission it is impossible that isnt sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres needless to say tens of kilometres nthis is not deep impact its a frivolous cheap impact nbut even with all that some overacting and a 3 4 rating its still watchable just dont think about it nokay n
 americas sweethearts has an intriguing premise and a great cast but it isnt nearly as edgy or funny as it should be nalmost all the problems with the project can be traced back to coscript writer billy crystal who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while cohosting comic relief charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg two other paragons of selfindulgence ncrystal ignores a simple but crucial rule for a screwball comedy to work the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous n americas sweethearts takes place at a press junket where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters nits a promising setup but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules thus dissipating the tension of the situation nby the end of the film all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed njohn cusack and catherine zetajones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector hank azaria a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp nof the last nine films eddie and gwen made together six crossed the 100 million mark but the prospects for their final effort a space opus titled time over time are far from rosy nwhile eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup gwens solo films have tanked nto make matter worse the director of the movie christopher walken a visionary who purchased the unabombers cabin and had it moved to his backyard is withholding the film from the studio insisting that the first screening be held at the junket ndesperate to win over the press the studio elects to hire lee billy crystal a recently fired publicist to salvage the situation nlee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation nhe enlists the help of kiki julia roberts gwens sister personal assistant and whipping girl nwhat lee doesnt know is that kiki is in love with eddie a fact that could temper her effectiveness npress junkets are a haven for control freaks nstudios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel with food and drink always at hand ngenerally on the evening of their arrival writers are bussed to see the featured film then ferreted straight back to the hotel nthe next day writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews nevery 30 minutes or so a producer director writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things nthe atmosphere is one of cordial oppression writers are free to ask what they want but understand that if the studio dislikes a question they may not be invited to future junkets nrepresentatives from tv stations face even more restrictions nthey get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew with the studio filming the exchanges nthe reporters are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars but to play it safe the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs nplacing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired but the screenplay undermines the conceit nthe junket is moved from the handsome but highly confining four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas nfor most of the film the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds completely safe from the eyes of the press nwhen they do deal with journalists the it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters premise is declawed ngwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and at the screening of the movie everyone connected with the film goes nuts all without any repercussions nlee certainly isnt bothered by any of the infantile outbursts in fact he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids nis the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors nhell no they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie nall of which underscores how billy crystal and cowriter peter tolan screwed up their own premise the comedy in americas sweethearts is based on barelyincontrol people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters except that it doesnt matter because any publicity is good publicity nand thus the very setup for the film implodes leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter nso what about the cast njulia roberts at her best playing the underdog is utterly charming here although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit and not a very convincing one by the way ncatherine zetajones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic nby casting himself as the publicist billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on comic relief stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks nin supporting roles hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed too broad nseth green is amusing as a toadie stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair though he has little to work with ncome to think of it little to work with is the operative phrase for this movie nas a hollywood satire americas sweethearts is toothless nas a romance it is at best a minor pleasure nsuch a good cast such a waste of their efforts nhad it not been taken long ago a better title for the film would have been much ado about nothing n
when i arrived in paris in june 1992 i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks fire walk with me since the movie wasnt scheduled to open in the u s until late august nhappily the filmthe prequel to david lynchs cult television serieswas playing in a fancy thx theater nunfortunately the theater was far more impressive than the movie which absolutely stinks much like a french lavatory nworse actually nfire walk with me directed by lynch will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read laura palmers secret diary nfor twin peaks junkies like me the movie is only marginally improved nthe plot is jumbled and illogical not to mention excruciatingly sluggish nthe first 30 minutes which have almost nothing to do with the main story line feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a murder in portland oregon nthe movie then stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper nlynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks washingtonone year later nah twin peaks familiar territory you think to yourself as angelo badalamentis distinctive musical score chimes in nwrong nthe movie proves that you really cant go home again or at least lynch cant nonly about a quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie leland palmer bobby briggs james shelly leo the log lady and a few othersmostly in meaningless cameos nthe rest of the twin peaks cast is nowhere to be seen and consequently lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tvs most enigmatic town ncast members michael ontkean sherilyn fenn piper laurie and richard beymer are sorely missed not to mention lara flynn boyle who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna nthe movie concentrates solely on laura palmer sheryl lee as she suffers through drug abuse prostitution and incest during her miserable last seven days on earth nthe night of lauras death which is truly terrifying is the films only remotely effective sequence nwe finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere nher murder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series which is gratifying for faithful twin peaks viewers nbut its an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful movie n

some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning a liveaction version of mr nmagoo being a prime example nthe cartoon figure mr magoo the bumbling blind man can be quite funny but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images nif you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls you are right but there is an even more astonishing selection nfor a director they tapped hong kongs stanley tong whose resume consists mainly of a handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan nthe story such that there is one is about a large stolen ruby which looks a woolworth reject nmr magoo gets it and of course does not realize he has it nmayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased nlike home alone 3 but without any class mr nmagoo can only be described as painfully bad nfifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity nthe movies humor is pathetically lame and the pacing is way off nwhen one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture one looks for some solace nmr nmagoo provides only three such moments nthe movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character who exudes his usual charm nthe only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus the sweet little bulldog nangus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture nfinally the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked nrather than attempt to adapt mr magoo to a noncartoon movie nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon nhe has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny nmy wife managed to get some sleep during the movie but i was not so lucky nhopefully this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not nmr magoo runs 1 37 nit is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages nmy son jeffrey age 8 said he thought the movie was good and really funny but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie nhe said he liked home alone 3 much more nhis friend maxim age 9 said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense nhis other friend nickolas age 8 said hed give the movie 12 but that it was really silly n
senseless r marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life nalas moments are simply that moments which are not enough to lift this fantasycomedy above its onejoke premise ngranted that one joke is initially amusing nwhen wayanss darryl witherspoon an economics major at stratford university hits some dire financial straits he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses nafter some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm nat this point the film sounds more like senseful than senseless but through some turns of the plot darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once essentially leaving himyessenseless nthis sets up some showcase moments for wayanss gift for physical comedy especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely hilariously limp nbut these gags and the gag behind the entire movie quickly grows stale nonce darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses instead of exploring any new comic territory director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness nwayans approaches each goround with gusto but by this point hes simply treading water for the rest of the films unfunny duration nsenseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didnt strive to be anything more than a comic trifle nhowever the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity ndarryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cashstrapped family and this serious angle seems to come from an entirely different movie nunlike wayanss last starring vehicle the surprisingly effective and serious the 6th man the emotional content of senseless is forced and unconvincing nany attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzlesdarryls romance with janice tamara taylor a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself does not generate sparks of any kind nonce his wb television sitcom the wayans bros comes to an end the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising bigscreen future ahead of him nbut if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless his film career could go the way of his oncepromising older brother damon who is now set to make his comebackon television n
ive always been a kevin kline fan silverado fish called wanda pirates of penzance and even his hamlet on pbs great performances nthe minute i saw the trailer for this film i resolved to see it nbesides the fact that kline starred it looked like a hilarious film ni got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent however as i also thought wow if theres this much funny stuff in the trailer there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film n oops i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo my name for our local multimultiplex nthe film began nthe film concerns an englishdrama teacher at a suburban high school named howard brackett nhe loves poetry and great literary works but his class is more interested in his famous former student played by matt dillon n id put in his name but my wife wont let me take notes during a movie and ive forgotten it nthey continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him nbrackett has been engaged to another teacher played by joan cusack for three years and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her nthe wedding however becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual nkline spends most of the first twothirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isnt nthe whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference nhis closest friends dont help matters bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party nthere are some genuinely hilarous moments one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity nkline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations nthe movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding nkline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows nif you want to be surprised dont read i am going to reveal the ending n instead of saying i do in front of his parents and most of the town and even some cameras he says im gay nthis is where the movie in my opinion falls apart nmost of the humor in the film had come from klines insistence that he was straight while at the same time loving poetry and being a senstivie guy dressing well and occaisionally acting prissy nit reminded me of the effeminate heterosexual sketch from saturday night live nit was funny it was sustainably funny and klines performance made it doubly so nhowever after the wedding the film drags on nthey should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion but it then gets into the serious side of what hes done nhe reconciles with his parents and his friends some of which had turned on him nthere are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time the scene with his mother and her friends which was hilarious seemed pointless and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless nfinally even though i am not catholic i found the scene with the priest to be condescending nthe preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship proclaiming to brackett in the third person hes gay nit got a chuckle from the audience but i was distracted by it and began to tire of the film nby the time the wedding had come and gone i found myself hoping it would be over soon n much like this review you are saying noverall if i have to quantify it i say rising action gets and climax and falling action gets nsee it in economy time n
look the new version of psycho came out and the world didnt end ni guess gus van sant really isnt the bringer of the apocalypse nunfortunately though that psycho didnt end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it nvan sants controversial retelling of alfred hitchcocks classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere even before it premiered nwithout benefit of an actual viewing many have said that the film will at best suck nbeing an almost good critic i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film at best sucked and that concludes the use of the word suck and hopefully the thoughts that i am a braindead orangutan ndirector gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it shotforshot using the same exact script with a few minor alterations nthe inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time nsuspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original nsadly that did not occur nit is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin from the original psycho but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen nin moores case the film would have been helped if the x files gillian anderson had been cast instead especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression nfrom the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence moore is scully nmortensen who i liked in g i njane opts to play sam loomis as a cowboyhick which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point nsam has a twang and a cowboy hat but thats about it nmortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory nanne heche in the janet leigh role does a few good things in her brief time on screen nat least her marion crane has a little life in her which cant be said for most of the rest of the cast nthe best work though comes from vince vaughn as the demented mamas boy norman bates nhes not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins but he is effective both in being naughty and nice nthe best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn where they simply talk nthere is some solid acting there something that is not carried through the rest of the film nvan sant has made a boring film nall the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 arent as eyecatching now nwhat passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they dont impress or excite nvan sant in what i assume is a grasp at originality decided to put some streamofconsciousness images into a few famous scenes was that a lamb in the middle of the road nthese images included with some questionable editing choices took away from the scenes themselves and caused at first bewilderment and later laughter ndefinitely not hitchcocks intention nat least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmanns original famous and terrific score nif a film like psycho does not frighten then whats the point naside from norman the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience nthere are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting nin the end however the new psycho is a noble attempt but alas a dismal failure n
you think that these people only exist in the movies but trust me theyre as real as life ni once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual persons brain with microwaves nthen i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections ni even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted nthese people had what are known as conspiracy theories ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public na little imagination goes a long way nin richard donners conspiracy theory jerry fletcher mel gibson is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything nhis latest that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle might sound outrageous to us but is all in a days work for him nhe combs the newspaper looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goingson behind the scenes and from there jerry draws his conclusions nupstanding citizen that he is he tries to convince alice sutton julia roberts of the justice department that the president must be warned nlucky gal alice who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since nwhat she doesnt know is that jerrys interest in her is far more than well professional nhe goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment nbut when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerrys ideas and his limitedcirculation conspiracy theory newsletter he finds himself in danger and in real need of alices help none of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an actionthriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action nor a significant number of thrills npart of this is a result of the films slow pace nit takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice and even once that is over with the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement nat over two hours this film could have been significantly condensed and had its running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour but even then the action scenes would not be able to save the film ninstead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces were treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite black elements black helicopter men in black action suits and body armor black vehicles you know the drill nthey come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time nbig deal weve seen it all before nwatching the film i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination but i was out of luck nnow when i say it took forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice i completely mean what one person is relative to the other and not romantic involvement noh donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring nyou see there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies also directed by donner than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory nthe two just dont click and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether like finding out hes been stalking her the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced nthe script in general also seems forced like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it then took it and forced it upon us ndialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable to the point that i almost stopped listening neven gibsons usual gift for ad lib couldnt punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest although one of jerrys theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing nunfortunately much of whats discussed in the film is not inherently important to whats going on but instead filler that starts out with potential but ends up just being extraneous because its never followed through nfor example jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station nhe even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break hence the water in a subway station and that the coroner should check the mans lungs for chlorine nthis is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him nyou know what happens then nnothing zip nada nno followup whatsoever so whats the significance nokay heres another one na couple of well known real life assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j d salinger novel the catcher in the rye njerry also has a bunch of copies nwhenever he goes into a bookstore he has to buy one nleaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin were never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin nnot when we find out about his salinger collection not when he goes to the bookstore not later on when we get the answer to our first question nthe point becomes totally extraneous noh did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film nyeah he plays this government psychiatrist named dr jonas who may or may not be a bad guy nthats about it nfor all the presence this usually marvelous actor has hes nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory nyou can just lump him in with the supporting players with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi nthis guy was really likable and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time nokay heres my theory nthis really started out as a great film but some of its jokes were actually true nthe government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security and this was what was left over n
a suave cool collected rich uptight bad guy cliche na clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs cliche na bad guy who owns a wild animal cliche na crooked chauvinistic law enforcer type cliche nat an intense moment our main character tries to get away but the car has trouble starting cliche ncomplaining about cliches cliche nok ok nso we always hear about cliches nbut if there was ever to be a prime example the real mccoy is it nnot one uttered word not one frame of film not one character in this whole movie isnt a cut and paste example of everything weve ever seen nthey might as well use this as a training film how to make a bank robbery film in the 90s nkaren mccoy kim basinger is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a sixyear stay at the state prison nshe wants to make things right and go straight especially with the fact that she has a sixyear old son out there who doesnt even know shes alive naware of mccoys bank robbing expertise sniveling bad guy jack schmidt terence stamp uses the same sixyear old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past nhe wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18 million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier which by the way is somehow due to schmidt nand if she refuses nwho knows what hell do to the kid n cue sinister laughter nthis movie is so pathetically pitiful that its hard to know where to begin nthe aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant ni cant stress enough how every single element whether it be a character the dialogue a plot twist etc is so damn generic that youll wonder if anyone is working behind the scenes let alone in front of the camera nbasinger is absolutely vacant nand where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her nheres someone that spent their time robbing banks and now as she heads onto the street were supposed to feel sorry for her nas she confronts her son who doesnt even know who she is are we supposed to break into tears nespecially when neither basinger nor zach english who plays the kid has any depth or emotionalradiance whatsoever ni suppose i should mention val kilmer nyeah thats right hes in it nquite sadly too seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name nand he got second billing nto be fair i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j t nbarker nunfortunately the script doesnt allow much room for improvement and when his character is used like bookends he never shows up in the middle of the film nwe have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project nthe real mccoy just cant keep its head above water and soon very soon sinks into a cliched mess of movie nthe actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer and the dialogue particularly schmidts trite dialogue falls like the niagra nthis is definitely one to avoid folks nthe real mccoy is anything but n
these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes nbut only a few years ago before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers nsequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south nthe way to regain popularity and prestige they thought was the use the same formulas characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place none of such celebrity was eddie murphy black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade nin order to return to the spotlight he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film beverly hills cop 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 nseven years later for the third instalment he used the directorial service of john landis another fading star with whom he successfully collaborated twice in trading places and coming to america nthis time however third time wasnt the charm and beverly hills iii was failure neddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback neddie murphy here plays axel foley fasttalking streetwise detroit policeman who raids illegal chop shop nthe routine police action ends in tragedy when the criminals kill foleys boss ndetermined to bring the killers to justice foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald timothy carhart nwhen it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles foley goes back to los angeles nthere with the help of his old friend local policeman rosewood judge rheinhold foley would clash with money counterfeit ring nten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different nin this decade the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film simply doesnt work nscreenwriter steven e de souza provides another conflict this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and businesslike professionalism of the bad guys nsince foley belongs to the former his character had to watch his language and the tone of the film in general is more infantile nunfortunately this film still belongs to action movie genre and there is too much violence for little children nnice example is the humorous scene in the beginning which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath nunlike donner with the lethal weapon series landis simply cant balance the comedy with regular action and the result is a film that fails in both aspects naction scenes are sometimes interesting but not too spectacular at the end scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself humour on the other hand falls flat nto make even worse some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure especially art expert turned into arms dealer played by bronson pinchot nin the end although the film provided some entertainment viewers at least critical ones would probably be happy to know that there arent any plans for beverly hills iv n
 desperate measures is a generic title for a film thats beyond generic nits also a depressing waste of talent with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles not to mention oncecool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of notcool flicks this thriller is more before and after than reversal of fortune nthe movie is a big disappointment and yet its somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it the premise is both promising and intriguing ntoo bad the executions all wrong though because the setup of desperate measures boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use nsan francisco cop frank connor garcia is a single parent with a troubling dilemma his son matt joseph cross is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission neven worse the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe michael keaton currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society nconnor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery hes at first reluctant but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital nwhen he does make a run for it connor offers close pursuit but for different reasons than his superiors including the crusty brian cox they want to take mccabe down while connor needs to keep him alive or all hope is lost for his little boy none misstep desperate measures makes is in its underdevelopment of matts illness nwhats needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow ntake for example a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital nthe police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him and what does connor do nhe shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight nconnor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son nwhatever nto be fair though the lack of story background is the least of the movies problems nfirst and foremost is how cheaply desperate measures trades the potential of its opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour nonce mccabe escapes the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills nthere are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away nalso the movie is so intent on giving you a hootinducing lipsmacking villain the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter natch that it completely casts garcias frank connor by the dullsville wayside desperate measures appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist and the movies headscratcher of a sendoff confirms this nthere is some good to be found amongst this mess particularly in the acting department ncast against type michael keatons understated menace is highly effective nalthough hes not given much believable to work with andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord njoseph cross as garicias ailing son is surprisingly unsentimental and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos nthis cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending but most is lost nit goes without saying that desperate measures needs an operation of its very own n
 the red violin is a cold sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached nits a movie that seems almost clinical as it traces the 300plusyears history of the legendary musical instrument of the title nopening in the 17th century the story shows how violinmaker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son nbut when tragedy strikes the violin becomes the personification of its makers grief nfrom there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery nagain tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph nwe follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in maos communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz samuel l jackson who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity nthe violin becomes morritzs obsession just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it nmorritz however is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creators intention n the red violin could have been a touching inspirational story as soaring as a beethoven symphony nhowever director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer nhere is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact ngirard for some unknown reason uses mostly master shots keeping his camera and thus us at a distance nwe get no feel for the miracle that is the violin nits resonance its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression nnor are any of the performances memorable nits as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin n the red violin promises much but delivers little nit is dull at times a bit pretentious and a might murky nthe movies music soars over its story and performers nand that is its only saving grace n

adam sandler vehicles are never anything special but continue to make a load of money nwhich really goes to show the sad state of cinema today nwhile good comedies like rushmore to choose a recent example gets limited release and doesnt make a lot of money big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash nits also nothing special and doesnt deserve the money its making nbut i digress nsandler plays sonny koufax a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age nhis girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him either wise up and get responsible or shes leaving him nby a strange set of events koufax ends up with julian played by twins cole and dylan sprouse a five year old kid nafter a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child koufax decides he wants to keep the child nhowever social worker mr brooks mostel finds out that koufax isnt the real father and wants to take julian back nkoufax along with his new girlfriend layla lauren adams fight to keep the child nbig daddy really isnt that good nmany of the jokes revolve around toilet humour and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny ntheres the occasional good one liner but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour nthe film after all these silly gags then suddenly turns sentimental and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous nthe court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable and not helped by the soppy overacting nits a poor attempt to win over the audience nadam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films except the wedding singer njoey lauren adams is much much better and deserves a far better film than this trash nsteve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo and his scenes are pretty funny nrob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man nthe two twins who play julian are o k they start out rather well but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn all american wholesome goodness at the end of the film where the tear juice is turned up high nbig daddy is really nothing special and is not even worth it for a few chuckles nalthough it is actually well put together with nice direction good production design and even some montages this professionalism cant help the fact that the script and characters are trash nbig daddy is for die hard fans of sandler and thats about it n
dear god this is a fantastically bad film nregardless of what i say about knock off you cant grasp its awfulness from my words nyou have to see it and experience it for yourself nheres the kicker though i suggest that you do so nyes this is a bad film easily one of the most incompetent films of the year but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure nin fact i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story ndont get me wrong im not excusing knock off nit reaches an unacceptable level of badness its so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was nit also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon michael wong paul sorvino and of course jeanclaude van damme nit does however have the entertaining presence of rob schneider and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark nas i watched it i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness nnow in retrospect it seems clear that it wasnt but its still a fascinating kind of mess ni dont like writing plot descriptions it is by far the most boring part of writing a review but in this case im off the hook there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off nfor the sake of comparison i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing ni paid closer attention to knock off and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray and is accused by the cia i think of selling knock off products knock off products are of course products that look like namebrand materials but are generic and cheap ni dont know what any of this has to do with martial arts but there are lots of martial arts in the film nray is good at martial arts so when he has to beat up bad guys theres no problem nrob schneider plays his sidekick although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film nlela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once nin fact every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do nin that order knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense nbut what a strange mess it is nit was written by stephen e de souza who also wrote die hard and 48 hours ncan this be the same man ni dont see how unless of course huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time nknock off seems to have an interesting premise as far as action films go but theres no semblance here nfor instance van damme is introduced and then seconds later hes running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong nwhy nwho knows nwhat are the implications of this ni have no idea nmost action films abandon depth in favor of action and this is normally a problem nknock off however is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut nthe acting is embarrassingly bad rochon in particular delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity nsorvino in addition deserves better than this nvan damme is bad but hes charming in that bad way and so i cant say that hes hard to watch although i rarely understood what he was saying nthe only exception is rob schneider who is actually quite funny a lot of the time ntsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison ntheyre all pointless gimmicks though such as shots of the innerworkings of a knock off running shoe nbut his action scenes are never boring one particular piece inside of a fruit factory a fruit factory is wellchoreographed nlots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy such as our heroes first encounter with the rochon character nbut did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ni hope he did for the alternative is a frightening thought nknock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania nif it were boring id give it zero stars nbut its not boring its loud and excessive and completely incoherent nits also funny even when it isnt meaning to be funny na bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesnt deserve to be fully lambasted ni recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness but i cant deny its zany useless charm noh i know theyre just action scenes looking desperately for a real story but theyre fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts nits fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this but that doesnt excuse the fact that it is indeed awful n

this movie is based off the wildly popular videogame series of the same name nbefore this film the game had a few spinoff cartoons which were ok nbut the idea of doing a movie is insane nit should have been animated if it should have been done at all ninstead the people do the best they can with a talented cast nyet it still fails nthe plot is completely different from the games plot im not complaining about that nthe story involves the mario bros having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company neventually they find a construction site by their nemesis which happens to be enviromentally unsafe nso due to luigis john leguizamo girlfriend princess daisy they go and investigate nthey get transported to a blade runneresque world lead by king koopa dennis hopper nsomehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic megacity jumbles in nthe plot is fine better than the movie deserves nthe acting is ok nthis seems to be more of a visual film nthe special effects are good especially on the robotic yoshi nhowever the film drags and is no fun nand it leaves itself open to a sequel which probably wont ever be made nthis movie begins sort of promising but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth nso if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper then watch super mario bros nthe movie nyou could do worse nbut you could definitely do better n nstreet fighter the movie 1995 starring raul julia and jean claude vandamme nthis movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called street fighter 2 it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot nit is more like a movie than it should be nyes its watchable nraul julia does a good job considering this was his final film nwhile the game had nonstop fighting sequences this movie is a hodgepodge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time ndoes it work nsort of nthe plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m bison raul julia nguile jean claude vandamme takes his troops to attack bisons main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over nin a short amount of time the movie introduces several characters well nit catches your attention nbut it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like theres chun li nor look at that fireball ryu did at vega nit hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets but goes no further nthis movie needed more action in the first place nthe action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting nif you like lighthearted action flicks or if you liked the game watch this one nit is even worth watching if you want to see raul julias last performance or if you cant get enough of van damme nother than that you could find better action flicks n n

girl 6 is in a word a mess ni was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film nthere was no sense of where the film was going or any kind of coherent narrative nif there was a point to the film i missed it ngirl 6 by the way is the way theresa randles character is addressed in the phone sex workplace all the girls are known by their numbers nthe plot such as it is theresa randle is a struggling n y actress and eventually takes a job as a phonesex operator nshe begins to lose contact with reality as her job consumes her nalso she must deal with the advances of her exhusband isiah washington nhe is an ex con thief and she tries to keep him away while at the same time its clear that she still harbors feelings for him nher neighbor jimmy spike lee functions as the observer mediating between the ex husband and girl 6 nhe also functions as a point of stability as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex nthe soundtrack consisting of songs by prince was jarring nit kept taking my attention from the film not altogether a bad thing ill grant you as what was transpiring onscreen wasnt that riveting nfor parts of the middle of the film the music stayed blissfully in the background nin the opening sequence and one scene later in the film however the music was particularly loud and distracting nof course ive never really cared for princes or tafkap if you like music nprince fans might love the soundtrack but it will probably be distracting even to diehard fans nof the performances the only one that stood out was spike lees buddy character jimmy nhe was excellent as the alwaysbroke neighbor of girl 6 nhe should have stuck to acting in this film nthere are several sequences that gave me the impression that hed like to be oliver stone when he grows up nthere are scenes shot with different types of film which are purposely grainy and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stones natural born killers nin that film they worked to propel the narrative nin this film they just made me more confused nthere are some amusing moments and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phonesex industry the multibillion dollar industry that it has become nother than that though nothing much happens nthere are a few intense moments as when one caller becomes frightening but even that is rather lackluster nim not the biggest fan of spike lee though id agree that he has done some very good work in the past nin girl 6 though he seems to be floundering nhe had an interesting idea a fairly good setup and seemed to wander aimlessly from there ngirl 6 earns a grade of d n
200 cigarettes takes place on new years eve 1981 nmonica played by martha plimpton is having a huge new years party neveryone in town is trying to get there but some are caught up in other things nthis is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes nas we meet the characters headed towards the party we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal and not interesting at all nthis disappointed me greatly nthe film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion nlucy played by courtney love is with kevin played by paul rudd nthe two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship but starts to blossom into something more than that nthis subplot is extremely boring and dull and i am getting quite sick of plots like that njaneane garofalo is involved in another subplot dealing with kevin nshe plays ellie an exgirlfriend of kevins nthis subplot is completely a waste of garofalos talent nthere was no point to it at all and it was hardly even in the movie nwhen lucy runs into a bartender played by ben affleck another subplot is formed nthe bartender is invited by lucy to come to monicas party nat the bar he runs into two more girls nthe girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker but unfortunately due to the terrible acting of both of them i dont even remember their characters names nben affleck is a good actor but his character doesnt go anywhere so he doesnt have much screen time to give a good performance nfeatherstone and parker are horrible in their roles and they are part of the reason the film is so bad nchristina ricci plays val and gaby hoffman plays stephie nthe two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost nthey meet some guys and end up going around with them all night nthis subplot was alright but it was quite annoying with stephies accent nhoffman did an okay job of acting but ricci did good nshe was underused considering she is such a wonderful actress nanother subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy played by goldie hawns daughter and jack played by jay mohr njack is an actor who doesnt care about the girls he goes out with he just likes dates for one night and the next day he doesnt nkate hudson is a huge klutz nshe gets herself into very funny situations that are the funniest parts in the entire movie nthey are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well nthis subplot could have been used more mainly due to hudsons performance nmohr wasnt good but he wasnt bad nhe was just alright which i didnt find acceptable nthere is not much to say about the performances in the film nnone of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not nthe only performances that i can judge are christina riccis as always good performance kate hudsons funny role courtney loves mediocre performance and paul rudds annoying and overused performance ni was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr ben affleck casey affleck gaby hoffman dave chapelle and especially out of janeane garofalo nthe two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes nmartha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981 nthe soundtrack is full of 1980s tunes ranging from i want candy to tainted love nthe songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s nduring the film i often found myself asking the questions is there a reason to this nis there any moral story nis there a point nare any of the events going on in the film necessary ndo i care what lucy and kevin are going through nthe movie is extremely boring and by the time they reached elevenoclock one hour before midnight i could not wait for the movie to be over nthe plot is okay but the subplots make it terrible nmaybe if the film was about the party not about the people at the party it could have been a lot better nthe bottom line just like a slasher movie this 80s comedy is just one too many n

i want to be involved in show business one day nand i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse nthis movie proves it for me ni was a little worried about the last batman film as i thought joel schumaccer taking over from tim burton would screw it up ni also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne nthey didnt nkilmer did a good job and the cast was left to carry the movie which they did even jim carrey as the riddler and i cant stand jim carrey because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles nthis film is different nthe cast is still impressive but here not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction hes one of those directors whos good with actors terrible with camera angles but writer akiva goldsmith doesnt really give an impressive cast anything to do nthe cast is impressive clooney is a surprisingly good waynebatman odonnell is a crafty robin as usual they couldve casted somebody better as batgirl my friend likes neve campbell but silverstone is not bad and thurman is a good poison ivy nthe major problem is schwarzenegger who is a terrible freeze nhis accent is so heavy you cant understand what he says and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act and they know it but they figure that if they flex their muscles say a limited amount of stuff and kill a bunch of guys then they figure nobodyll notice nthats the trouble with me i notice nschwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney or as much money as he got for this but hollywood thinks he does npatrick stewart was the person id heard that was considered to play freeze and he wouldve been so much better nor sean connery but not arnold im not an actor but i play one in real life schwarzenegger ni realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film but it wouldve been nice if theyd casted a star that had talent for the role nakiva goldsmiths screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film nin a regular batman film theyd concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more but elle macphersons julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is nthere is talk of a fifth batman movie nmy interest to see it is low but i hope its better than this nif you dont want to waste your time rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster nany other n
the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and couldve been effective nsuch is the case with urban legend the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks nthe idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends nexamples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house nthe killer wears one of those l l bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up so you cant see the face ni guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days nanyhow the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric nits a very good setup that promises more chills to come nunfortunately the film never takes off from there nthe movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus nlike most slasher flicks this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac or in this case an axe wielding maniac nive always wondered why these killers dont save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill nafter the fine first scene the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying youthoughtitwasthekillerbutwasjust someoneelse scares nthese are always accompanied by loud bursts of music ni guess sudden sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days nthe actual killer will attack at about every third music blast nthe slasher appears attacks the victim is eviscerated and the tedious cycle appears anew nfalse scares should always be used in moderation nsomeone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just arent as scary as they used to be nthis movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commitits not frightening nremember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in scream and scream 2 nthis movie still adheres to them ntons of illogical moments about more than i really have the inclination to list nand i dont mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense nthat type of illogical can be fun nthis film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember nthe last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that youll be laughing more than youll be screaming nactually you wont be screaming at all nat its best the acting can barely be called adequate and the script couldve definitely used a rewrite or two nthe film still manages to have some strong points nthe killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans nthere are some intentionally funny moments n these were exceeded by the unintentional ones nthe film is well made from a technical standpoint nbesides the first part there is also another good scene a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station nif there had only been more sequences like this that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music urban legend mightve been worth your money n
 be warned nthe following review contains some harsh language nthe blair witch project nquite possibly the least scariest movie of all time nif you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy nmy colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more nand this worked for him nwell im sorry but nothing nis nothing nnothing is not more nits nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ni do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing n nothing is free available all around the world at a location near you ni am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary ni could just discount them and say well i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow nbut i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesnt hold water nthere must be some other reason n then again maybe my first thought is correct i think ill try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction nwhen i hear people praising this film i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97 of this movie three kids bickering with each other about being lost nthey only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time nthis being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout josh nover and over nthis film should not be called the blair witch project it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost nand argue with each other noh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting josh nand if you thought that was scary wait till you see a pile of rocks and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear noh yeah and some goo on one of their backpacks nyouve never seen terror like this folks and you dont want to nthe chevy chasegoldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film n for current films i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience nthis film is an example of marketing with no substance nthe marketing was brilliant and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film nthey want this film to be good nand i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they dont have anything else to praise nthat wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along but this is not it nthis film could have been so much better njust think if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff ni saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it nshe was sold on this film nand then at one point during it she turned to me and asked are nwe supposed to be scared by this nive heard one opinion that you have to use your imagination to create the fear in this movie nwell i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do nuse their imagination and create a good movie ni mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it nbut even if you like this idea then what are you imagining nan entity called the blair witch nsome rednecks fucking with these kids nare either of these things really scary when you think about it nive heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something nwell sure thats scary in real life but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting nyou could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary but in a film it wouldnt be nand no a movie does not need a big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy nactually the less the better see the equally awful remake of the haunting nbut you have to do something nyou cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary if it were real nand by the way about the shakycam filming in blair witch narent these supposed to be filmmakers who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly nim not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified thats justified nim talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they cant seem to shoot anything smoothly at all nminor quibble there nthere is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers nthat the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank nand i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves what was i thinking nbut if they dont then thats fine nif it works for them then thats okay i guess ni just lament that by making this movie a hit we are going to be subjected to more of the nothing is more approach npretty soon were going to get some movies like this just a still shot of a prison jail cell nfor 90 minutes nand well have to use our imagination and think to ourselves my god wouldnt it be scary to spend life in prison nthis movie is the scariest movie of all time nor a shot of a coffin with some funeral directors arguing with each other n man do you know how scary it would be to die nnow this is the scariest movie of all time nr n
there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been nthe scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 where a onetime cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets fists stuffed into coat pockets nto one side of him residents scavenge for food in the street to the other side german troops beat a group of jews njakob however never stops moving nits an efficient effective setup for the character who is clearly nobodys idea of a hero at the outset nhe is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them excising his moral peripheral vision nthe setup is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior nafter a visit to a german commandants office and a moment alone with a turnedon radio jakob learns that russian troops are quite near nwhen he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews they become convinced that he must have a radio which is a punishable offense in the ghetto nthe good news brings hope to the ghetto the everyday specter of suicide vanishes na private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive nthis promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting the ordinary person in question jakob heym is played by robin williams ni am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his serious roles with every passing year ncompare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams and see how much more mannered he has become or at the very least how much less sensible at choosing material njakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions but williams always looks like hes struggling not to craft them nwhen he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10yearold orphan lina hannah taylor gordon he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky noh yes and then theres that little girl nsome viewers will undoubtedly consider the heros fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful but those scenes arent problematic because theyre familiar ntheyre problematic because theyre jarring and distracting introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldnt have been about cutesy relationships njakobs character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others but there are plenty of others without poor little lina nevery scene with her feels contrived pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people nit is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywoodized holocaust combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways ndirector peter kassovitz working from jurek beckers novel crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople and draws solid performances from armin muellerstahl as a oncerevered doctor and bob balaban as a barber drifting into depression nthere are just too many things going on that prove distracting whether its the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter or williams incongrous presence or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl njakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling and has too compelling a central character to waste nand after one wonderful early scene you can see the film wasted and fumbled away n
it rocksactually lots of rocks fly at us or from us in slow or fast motion at several points in the film nthey seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward and when they landonce in a while when we need a break from the space sequencesthey cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like n nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur nthey also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon a steroid users answer to deep impact nbruce willis stars as harry stamper a famed oildriller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond zero barrier and destroys our planet nwhy an oil driller nthey require someone experience with deepcore mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid n in one unintentionally nhilarious sequence nasa asks harry to inspect a deepcore driller they built based on his blueprints it is poorly constructedharry criticizes almost every aspect of it nwe trust nasa to build space shuttles nharry assembles the obligatory ragtag bunch of cowboys including a blond guy a fat guy a black guy a wiseass and the man who is sleeping with his daughter affleck nonce they reach space we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrongperhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes nwhether or not they save the day i will not reveal nnor will you care ni will say this you know youre in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope nwillis has barely a chance to come alive ditto for affleck ntheir big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act in a last minuteand futileattempt to inject warmth into the material nsteve buscemis characterthe wiseassis exceptionally problematic n rockhound as hes called is sarcastic and foolish so they tape him to a chair where he spends most of the film nso why did they bring him up there to begin with nrather why write him into the film give nhis almostwitty oneliners to serious willis who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig nim guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel at least in my world where the sky is blue nliv tyler is pretty and humourless as always suspiciously four of her fathers bands aerosmith songs grace the soundtrack ndirector michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick like ketchup eventually drowning the movie onscreen n the middle hour is a nonsensical pyrotechnic assault on the average primates brain nwhenever someone dies in this movie a crew member inevitably yells out we lost insert dead persons last name here ni must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oilguycumastronaut from a live one and closeups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance as their skin was often covered in fake blood narmageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla nit looks nicer and has fewer plotholes within its equally ludicrous framework nit has a vivid soundmix nbut at almost twoandahalf hours i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story nthe love story has been played up in the ads perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanicfever nbollocks nthe lovers in the film are miles apart throughouterase all thoughts of nude sketching or carsex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a mooncrawler nremember a little film called jaws nin this film three independentminded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark nthey didnt much like each other at first eventually they started to respect one another none of jaws great scenes involved the wouldbeahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories nthis is the sort of malebonding foreign to bay or his producer jerry bruckheimer who throw too many characters into the mix and expect well care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end nnot once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintancesid be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before action was called na male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who dont bare their souls who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chestbeating bravery nto this i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic nor brave nor smart even this team couldnt build a birdhouse nand if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailera trailer for a movie written by a team of bodybuilders and greeting card authorsive never been a prouder wimp my whole life n

ive heard it called jaws with claws and thats a fair summation of the plot though that tag line does little to quantify quality ndirector stephen hopkins blown away predator 2 and screenwriter william goldman maverick misery would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century ntheyve stacked the deck with two big stars val kilmer michael douglas a bigger production design beautiful photography by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music nthe movie doesnt make a lick of sense though either as an epic or as your basic boofest nin fact some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think youve stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000 the movie nhow about the three guys with rifles who trap a lion and then cant even hit the damned thing nor the hamonwry acting of michael douglas who chews more scenery than the animals ever do nor my favorite lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops n

capsule in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace nthere is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise njohn carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films especially assault on precinct 13 that the new film comes off as his homage to himself n 0 4 to 4 njohn carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes nfor a writer and director of horror films supposedly an expert on horror it is a very bad mistake to make nghosts of mars is called a horror movie but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly lowpowered alien menace nin addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars carpenter would have grounds to sue nthis film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 the thing and prince of darkness nit is in fact surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way nbut that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience nghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 nmars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear which is good for the films budget nit is never mentioned but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earthnormal again making it easier to film nsociety has changed a bit by that time but it has advanced surprisingly little napparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control nand from carpenters view women have really made a mess of things nsociety has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten nthe basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 yes precinct 9 has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony ninstead of having the criminal napolean wilson this film has the criminal desolation williams ninstead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face well ghosts of mars nbecause the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner but they essentially behave as human savages in another lapse of imagination nthe story is told in flashback flashback within flashback and flashback within flashback within flashback nghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red yellow and black ncarpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat nsadly what follows is not really up to the buildup nthe terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss nhis idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring nthese are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience nsomewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights nwithin a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars red planet and ghosts of mars nafter mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by ni rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale nfollowing the movie i showed my wife who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did carpenters classic assault on precinct 13 nher comment is that it was seeing the same film twice n
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies nluckily my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta ni knew it was going to be a bad print with only halffaces and poor sound quality but i couldnt help myself ni got it nwell after watching it it indeed was a bad print i was glad i didnt dish out 7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie nthis movie really sucks nit had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy nfor example how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days njackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail nthe songs are bad the acting is bad especially deepti bhatnagars and the direction is the worst of all nthe comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up ni didnt even finish the movie ni couldnt take it anymore nnote but if anyone out there liked aatish by the same director i guess youd like this movie nits practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff naditya panscholi is the sidekick again n i was going to give it a zero but i personally like jackie shroff so i loosened up a little nhe looked fresh wore good clothes as always and his performance even though it wasnt his best was the only saving grace of the movie n
 tarzan and the lost city is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while nnot only it is poorly written badly acted and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid nunfortunately its not bad in the way great colossal misfires like heavens gate 1980 or ishtar 1987 were bad ninstead it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with which begs the question of why it was made in the first place nwith all the good scripts lying around hollywood unproduced how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen nof course tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history he has appeared in over forty films which have ranged from the very good 1984s greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes down to the really bad 1981s tarzan the ape man with bo derek nmost of these films were just cheapie bmovies made in the thirties and forties starring exolympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps ntherefore if another tarzan movie is to be made one might assume that it would have something new to offer a different angle an original storyline anything to set it apart from all the others n greystoke added a neverbeforeseen level of realism to the pulpy tale and even tarzan the ape man at least had the misguided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo dereks bare breasts n tarzan and the lost city on the other hand has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue nthe script by bayard johnson and j anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come ncomic books have better plots than this nthe movie is so bad in fact that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summers comedy george of the jungle ndidnt the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs nthe story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established a quick opening narration tells of tarzan casper van dien being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage nwhen the movie starts in 1913 he is a civilized english gentleman without an english accent and he is to marry jane jane march in less than a week nhowever when a wicked archeologistgraverobber named nigel ravens steve waddington begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar one of africas last great secrets the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle nat first jane refuses to go pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her apeman nonce the film gets going in its own sluggish way it delves into a series of jungle adventures as tarzan jane and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city nmost of the socalled adventures are cheesy predictable and unexciting with no pace tension or action to speak of nthere are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies ranging from raiders of the lost ark 1981 to the goonies 1985 nwhen the movie is running short on action it includes a few greenpeacefriendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals releasing a baby elephant from a trap and throwing ivory tusks into the river nthe movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality nfor instance when tarzan who was raised in the jungle is bit by a cobra he doesnt even attempt to suck the venom out like any semiexperienced weekend backpacker would do ninstead he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival nof course one cant help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is nnot to ruin the ending or anything but there is no lost city nthere is however a lost pyramid which i suppose is all the resourcestrapped fx department could come up with the special effects are not worthy of a madefortv movie nwhich also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid when its sitting right out in the middle of an open field nstrictly speaking tarzan and the lost city isnt even bad enough to have camp quality although casper van diens laughably stiff performance comes real close nthis movie proves what starship troopers only hinted at he cannot act but he sure looks wellgroomed even in the deepest heart of the african jungle nvan dien is much too much of a prettyboy to be an effective tarzan hes a calvin klein model in a loin cloth ni also wondered what the makeup department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa1983 steve perry haircut nwaddington makes a decent villain although hes like a charmless version of belloq from raiders of the lost ark as jane the exmodel jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan nshe does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two but whenever a snake comes into the picture she is reduced to a hysterical mess nhowever amidst all this complaining i do have one piece of good news n tarzan and the lost city is so lacking in ideas both new and old that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid nso we can say this much for it at least it had the decency to be short n
 shagadellic groovy baby n smashing nadorn the 14 page ad for this movie tabbed as the 1 comedy in america as of may 8th ndid we attend the same movie nat 87 minutes it seemed overlong like a snl skit on steroids and at any length it seemed unfunny nyes the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills and yes the concept dealing with a 60s secret agentpop icon played by myers awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle his arch enemy dr nevil also played by myers in the present day had a great deal of potential nfun costumes and scenery and potential do not a movie make so lets throw in a hefty dose of bathroom humor ndont get me wrong i like a good bubbles in the bathtub joke as much as the next person but to have this type of humor be the funniest thing about your movie is a waste of yuor talent and my money nbut the way things work these days in the movie business all a film has to do is call itself the funniest and people will believe it ni do give this film stars because of the sets costumes and sadly unmet potential n
starring ben stiller elizabeth hurley maria bello janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz npermanent midnight is a pretty bad movie though it took me a few days to conclude this nthe film is more masturbatory than bleak with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity n he has a 6000 a week drug habit nultimately as adapted by veloz jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve you are less mystified by his selfdestructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself nben stiller plays stahl a young author who arrives in l a with ambition and a nasty drug habit nhe eventually gets a gig for 5000week writing for a sitcom called mr chompers a thinly veiled standin for alf chompers looks just like alf except hes blue marries a producer hurley so she can get a green card and hooks up with a spanish mother liz torres who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons ninsert proverbial downward spiral here npermanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback with recovering addict bello meeting stiller at a fastfood restaurant where stiller works the drivethru as part of rehab taking him back to a hotel and between bouts of serious screwing listening to his life story nive spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractiveworse ive been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive nas stahl stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect posttheres something about mary of either the actor or a comedy writer nwhat separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punkjunkies it seems is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy nwatch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby nwatch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smackfueled babble nstiller gives a technically flawless performance the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie nbut permanent midnight is mostly soulless nwhen the movie poses the question will stahl be saved nand then answers it in the form of bellos character basically a shrink in black panties could a person care less nin the film version of his autobiography of the same name stahl doesnt need saving he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself nif you learn anything about the other characters in this movie its that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywoodtypes known to man n stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs nis this hollywood california ni learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead nof course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems nso basically his drug habit got him a book deal a movie based on his life and now hes apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects nso much for the moral of that story ntemporary midnight is more like it nbill chambers september 1998 n

plunkett macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott brother of ridley and tony nnaturally this got me worried nwould jakes talent be inherited from ridley or tony nif it was from ridley than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in nif it was from tony it would be wham bang drivel nunfortunately the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm ncarlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen plunkett carlyle who is poor and unruly and captain james macleane miller a clean cut gentleman nas the tagline clearly wants to make known they rob the rich and nothing else nthe film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca tyler nhot on both their tails is mr chance ken stott who wants to see them both dead nplunkett macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose nalthough undoubtedly slick and fast paced theres very little merit contained in the film ncarlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair although their characters are criminally undeveloped nit appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes but not on the script nthe five screenwriters three credited have produced an still born movie theres very little development in the story nalso major events such as mr cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are are so rushed that they barely happened nthe story is a bit of a mess frankly nthe performances arent bad carlyle and miller are typical lads but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest nher irritable stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on nshe looks nice though nmore interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character he hams it up well nken stott is suitably evil as chance but again he is nothing but a flat character ni didnt particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived nalthough a disappointment in writing and a minor success in acting the film certainly look lavish with good costumes and wonderful sets nbut production design alone cant save a movie especially a movie as bad as this mess njake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty with f ck this and stand and f cking deliver splattered all over the place nthe mtv editing and direction are flash enough but in the end decidedly empty nplunkett macleane is a massive disappointment nalthough somewhat enjoyable during parts its so light it could float off the screen if it wasnt just images on a reel ntheres no thought no development no plot just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to genxers nalthough its a great idea update a period drama to the mtv generation its execution is awful and would more likely bore than excite nsloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless its hard to recommend plunkett macleane as a movie but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video ngive it a miss n

if you have ever seen fox tvs special car chase programs youll have a good idea about the content of ronin the new action thriller from director john frankenheimer nthe film involves a mysterious briefcase that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on nan irish women dierdre played by the truman shows natascha mcelhone hires a group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase namong the people she hires are sam robert de niro vincent jean reno and gregor stellan skarsg rd from good will hunting ndierdres groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it nthey accomplish this task but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again nthe briefcase stays on the run as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed nthe writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie but failed to understand that just because there are surprises it doesnt add too the credibility of a senseless script nthe plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on after the apparent climax of the film nbut to add to the excitement as i mentioned earlier there are endless car chase scenes nthey are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story ndont get me wrong i love car chases but they were overdone and too long here nwe never do find out whats in the briefcase but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller n

i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago ni guess my memory really sucks nthere is very very little that is funny in caddyshack nthe laughs are few and far between and what there are really arent that great ncaddyshack as the name implies more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club nmichael okeefe plays said caddy nwhy they cast this unknown fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me nthe movie doesnt seem to have a real plot just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera nthe only real story if you can call it that was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper bill murray who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course nmost of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera with painfully limited success nbill murray is slightly amusing in places but fairly wasted nthe biggest waste of all is chevy chase who didnt even crack a smile on my face with his characters lame zenlike approach to golfing nthere are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie ni guess thats what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid nim not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper nnothing about this movie works nit wouldnt have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasnt going to fly nmost of the scenes just couldnt possibly be funny nits as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world nim sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny nin reality they were painfully embarrassing to watch nthere is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the hot babe of the movie walking by in her bikini nolive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl neverything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned nmaybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny nbut for the rest of us stay the hell away from caddyshack n
synopsis the president of a company wants to test his selfappointed successor whos psychotic and thinks its a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall ncomments tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it nstrike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotapes sticker in black marker not typically a good sign when you rent a film nstrike two came while the previews played ndid you ever get a sinking premonition about a movies quality or lack thereof while watching the trailers that come before it nwell the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows and they all looked bad definately not a good sign ntracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout nabout the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery nto be fair the first halfhour or so promises at least a watchable thriller nwolf larson who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the films title njames brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten nbrolins character for some inexplicable reason thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin practically isolated with lebrock and larson whom hes decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company nby the time the characters arrive at the cabin this film begins to become tedious napparently brolins successors test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing which dont seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city nbut then again what do i know about business ni do think though that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch nlarsons character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill nthis leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters which really isnt enough to sustain it nthe films writer must have taken a cue from stephen king as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and geralds game nlarson and lebrock fight and torture each other the tables get turned a couple of times while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help nsome old guys around too just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film nthe old guy however miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous its worthy of a chuckle or two noutside of that chuckle unfortunately tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors for some reason become increasing obnoxious nif youre in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey dont nmake tracks to a far superior suspense film like misery n
tomb raider nfun nexciting nchallenging ngiven the unprecedented popularity especially among teenage boys of the video game that sports an uberbuff pistol packin babe who raids well ntombs you have to believe its these three things and more n lara croft tomb raider the big screen variant of said video game which features a pumpedup angelina jolie the oscar winner for girl interrupted no less in the title role is however none of these things nit isnt fun it isnt exciting and the only challenge is seeing how long you can stay in your seat i suffered through to the bitter bitter end the wife opted for barnes noble at the 45minute mark ndirected by simon west with the same subtlety he brought to con air tomb raider is an emptyheaded big budget bore nthe story borrows unintelligently from that mother of all turkeys hudson hawk the same hokum about planetary alignments and sacred stones that when brought together well nwho the heck cares and it makes super mario bros bob hoskins illadvised career move look like rocco and his brothers that classic of italian neorealism nill go out on a limb here and say i suspect theres actually more character development in the video game than the movie proper nthis is where the jolie defendersvideo game nuts jump in and say this movie isnt about character development its about kicking serious butt or bum since ms croft hails from englands green and pleasant nwith lips breasts and biceps all inflated to the max lara croft is all about posturing and jolie has a hard time simply standing still without trying to look tough nok lets forget challenging nshouldnt tomb raider be at the very least fun and exciting nshouldnt our buttkicking heroine also encompass the sophistication of say james bond with the wit of indiana jones ntheres no humor to be found anywhere in tomb raider even though it tries hard from time to time neven the mummy returns didnt take itself too seriously nthe villain here is noticeably lacking the special effects are ridiculously overblown and unnecessarily complicated and the script is nonexistent nto liven things up perhaps jolies live father jon voight puts in a few minutes as laras dead father lord croft talk about a stretch none thing i hadnt expected from the film is that jolie affects a slightly better english accent than her pa although i suspect that thinlooking moustache hes forced to wear gets in the way some nunsuccessful not entirely nif anything lara croft tomb raider makes you want to check out the video game itself to figure out exactly what all the fuss was about n
out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey a cold uninvolving confusing new thriller nthough the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard author of out of sight as well as jackie brown get shorty and pulp fiction after you watch it you realize that its not nearly good enough nin an aggressively nonlinear fashion the limey li mey noun an english gentleman tells the story of wilson terrence stamp a british excon just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery nhe has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny nhe doesnt know much about the circumstances of her demise all he has is a name terry valentine nvalentine was jennys former boyfriend a wealthy and corrupt record executive nhes played by peter fonda in his first major role since the terrific ulees gold in 1997 nseeking valentines reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson nhe finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party nhe winds up breaking his cover eventually setting off valentines head of security and valentine himself who decides to run for it nwhat a mess ni have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time pulp fiction which twisted time every which way was a masterpiece but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer nthe limey does exactly that nthe plot is permeated with flashbacks flashforwards and what can only be described as random timetravel without any evident purpose nthere is no method to this movies madness nit uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably nthe plot isnt particularly interesting in the first place traditional mildly hackneyed and not very involving nthis is a sort of brooding film our protagonist doesnt speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude ni felt like the director wasnt very interested in the proceedings himself almost like he made this film for a paycheck nditto for the editing which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant nsixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal nhes not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here npeter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor hes shy quiet but always effective nhes adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression his feelings dont always show on his face by you can always tell what they are nthis is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion nwhy soderbergh couldnt just parrot down and tell a story i dont know but what he does do certainly doesnt work nthe result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil even the action scenes dont work n1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one act two act three storyline but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it nshall we go back to basics n
a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature beams itself onto a russian science vessel nwell this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable scifi thriller nanyhow this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the virus known as man nthe original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it nno more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies the movie is that predictable nthe story is full of very shallow characters that dont do much other than subsist nthe captain of the tug played by donald sutherland makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age looks to be in his 60s nto add to this were shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks nsome of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific in a typhoon no less nnone of the characters seem to work together at all they are always bickering and vying for some form of control nthis makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable nall the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects nthe waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves nit looks genuinely fake granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish nalso on the topic of flaws the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly why nif this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics should it not be able to create them move faster nregardless the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it nas to the actual casting for the movie finally there is nothing to complain about nthe actors were superb but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles nhaving the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe nwatching these actors act this story out made it bearable if barely nthe one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening nso if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre scifi thriller then you wont be too disappointed nas the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect nthis movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv n
director andrew davis reworks his fugitive formula and the results are about as exciting as his last film the dreadful comedy steal big steal little was funny nkeanu id rather play music than play another action hero reeves is the grad student on the run who along with his superfluous sidekick rachel weisz has been framed for a sabotaged science experiment that vaporized eight chicago city blocks n the mushroomcloud explosion is a knockout and easily the best part of the movie nor as one audience member succinctly summed it up whoa nfalse information implicates their involvement and boy and girl are soon on the run fleeing over open drawbridges across icy lakes and through the corridors of power at a topsecret underground energy facility naiding and abetting is the teams shady mentor played in an excellentbutso what performance by morgan freeman n brit brian cox is also about as the behindthescenes bad guy nhe has some fun fiddling with a southern accent nunfunny overscored and without a single shred of suspense chain reaction is the summer movie to walk out on nif you make it to the end a mess of crosscutting involving another imminent explosion youll hear somebody say i guess its time to go nheed that warning n
who knew that in 16 years eddie murphy who made such a brash raucous bigscreen splash in 48hrs nwould become ncuddly nthe disconcerting trend begun in this summers cutesy largely laughfree doctordolittle continues with this earnesttoafault dramedy nalthough he is topbilled here murphy is merely support for jeff goldblum who plays ricky hayman the programming director at a home shopping network nsales are way down and rickys job hangs by a thread until he meets g murphy a mysterious spiritual guru whom a desperate ricky puts on the air nwhile sales skyrocket and g becomes an overnight sensation the reinvigorated rickys greed grows endangering his budding romance with a goodhearted media research consultant kelly preston nwriter tom schulman has some promising ideas satirizing home shopping and infomercials and the nature of instant celebrity nbut these ideas would have more bite if stephen herek had invested any energy into the direction of the film nthe sluggishly paced holyman is not only slow and overlong 113 minutes but an unfunny bore and murphy can do little to juice up the proceedings cleansed of both the attitude and comic sensibility that made him a star g is for the most part a straight man he is a curiously lifeless presence ngoldblum is actually quite good but its hard for the audience to sustain much interest in his character and spiritual journey when the director doesnt seem to be much interested either n
well as i check my score card for what ive done this holiday weekend it reads good ideas 0 and dumb ideas 1 ni dont know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie nbut in my defense i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him nthe film that im talking about is a night at the roxbury one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit nwayne and garth these two are not nrather we meet doug and steve butabi the actors names are not worth mentioning two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city the roxbury ndriving in their dads bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club nhave you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change ntheir second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pickup lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl let me see that label njust as i thought made in heaven says one of the brothers nand like the losers that they are they fail to do either for much of the film nhowever as fate would have it an accidental meeting with whateverhappenedto richard grieco gives them the allimportant ticket to get in ntheir sad lives take on a whole new direction nthey make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene nand they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women nbut their newfound popularity does not impress their father who has other plans for them nthe unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a onejoke movie and the brothers are the joke nactually theres about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff nalas too long for tv and way too short for a featurelength film nthus there just isnt enough material to sustain the 83minute movie ntheres no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaways europop song what is love ni was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash nto take up more film time there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug nthis creates not only friction between the brothers but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well nshes educated and a forebearing witch nmeanwhile doug is a complete loser nhow did these two ever get together ni suppose that if i can ever figure out the answer to that question ill have figured out why i decided to go and see this movie nif youre looking for entertainment you wont find it at the roxbury n
i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stones any given sunday nits an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rockem sockem profession of pro football nunfortunately the director seems to have only one priority on his mind sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers nin altering each frame with quickflash photography and dizzying inyourface editing stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics nwe see glimpses of greatness but any given sunday has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledygook nit grows tiresome and monotonous nyes stone has pulled a brian depalma nmatters of importance are pushed aside right from the getgo ntony damato al pacino coach of the struggling miami sharks finds his team stuck in a losing rut naging quarterback cap rooney dennis quaid appears to be losing his touch and damato cant seem to ignite any passion in his squad nwhen cap is injured on the field and after a patch of unlikely events occur thirdstring qb willie beaman jamie foxx is brought into the game nonce in the huddle and this becomes an ingame ritual beaman horks all over the field nnerves you see neventually though the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates sparking his rise to fame in the football world the endorsements the music videos etc and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behindthescenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like nand i believe it nthere is some intriguing insight posed but in the big scheme of things stone fumbles the ball nthe problem with the directors visual approach is this he uses extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have been appropriate nfootball is an exciting game to watch but stone seems to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the adrenaline rush ni guess he is mistaken nany given sunday is a visual kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor more frequently than it excites them nmany football fans including one i attended with are liable to be disappointed with the ultrastylish way stone has decided to present the game nin return a threestar film becomes unfortunately degraded due to the directors tampering nin welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes to a break this actually shows decent character development and interaction nfor instance heated returns between damato and feisty young owner christina pagniacci cameron diaz are enjoyable to watch nthere is also a solid performance from jamie foxx who experiments with great success in his first trek into dramatic territory nthe stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine aaron eckhart lauren holly annmargret and charlton heston in an extraordinarily brief appearance nunfortunately too many big names are wasted a typical demise for a film with such a large and experienced cast npacino makes some interesting progress with his character nyou begin to identify with coach damato and the morals he is striving for nbut i often felt he was just another play thing stone could weave in and out of his editing dynamics nany given sunday is a watchable but disappointing sports film in which plot and characters take a back seat to excessive filmmaking technique nand a very distant back seat at that n

adam sandler isnt known for appearing in deep thoughtprovoking films but hes still a really funny guy nmost of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out nbig daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandlers comic performance and its a miserable failure nsandler plays a thirtysomething loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy played by cole and dylan sprouse nas one might expect from the synopsis director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say goodbye to one another in addition theres a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself ntheres a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters and the film features passable performances from sandler joey lauren adams as the love interest and the two young boys but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny n
for better or worse the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated oversexed underwritten thrillers napparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesnt change a thing since body of evidence wasnt written by him but has a puzzling eszterhasish presence all over it nin other words its a really dirty and b really really stupid nmadonna first warning sign stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around seminaked presumably for the edification of the shrimp nshes been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover nalready two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless shes under thirty or at least looks it and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men nwhats worse is that the movie confirms all the above and wallows in them as well nmadonnas character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition n and yes there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy nthis movie leave no scummy stone unturned nanyway willem dafoe very good but completely wasted also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonnas sexuality nhow do we know this nbecause his character is set up with the token wife and kids nhow obvious is it that hes gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up nand get kicked out of the house nand get welcomed back anyway ndont skip to the end yet were just getting warmed up ndafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie nmost of it is about as erotic as openheart surgery since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax always the kink of choice among screenwriters who dont know the first thing about really kinky sex and smashed light bulbs ndont ask nanother thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story its insanely dull nwhats worse is that body of evidence is dull everywhere not just in the sex scenes nthe stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninthhand from other bad courtroom drama scenes nthe thriller business itself is ridiculous it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor nand the ending another homage to eszterhas maybe n is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact frame where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in nthe director is uli edel all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f everyone has to eat i guess but this isnt a meal ticket its leftovers n
as a hotshot defense attorney kevin lomax keanu reeves has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients nhe is also an excellent judge of character knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witnesss testimony nand on top of that hes a damn good trial lawyer nin the opening scene it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty but it doesnt hamper lomaxs desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt thereby getting an acquittal nhis unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country headed by john milton al pacino nhe is brought to their headquarters in nyc where he immediately impresses milton and is subsequently offered a fulltime position as head of their newlycreated criminal law division nlomax is soon given the case of his life nhe must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide nthe draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell nhe works late defends the guilty pledges his soul to his firm and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife mary ann charlize theron nbut what starts off as a promising john grishamlike story about consciencestricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story nit begins like a typical parable where a smalltown boy makes it big but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money power and greed nbut milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm nquite literally he is the devil in disguise and as the movie progresses he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago nfreaky and frightening things begin to happen and after much of the film has elasped miltons horrifying intent is finally revealed nthe movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts nthe first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a bigcity trial lawyer nthe second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax nunfortunately the two never mix well into a cohesive story and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere ngranted the film is very handsomelooking nyoull enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino nyoull also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties nyoull also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away nthis was one of the better storylines but unfortunately is only a subplot nas with all things involving the devil you can expect nothing but the worst nin the first few scenes reeves anchors the film but then slowly drifts into the background nhis path from selfvanity to selfconsciousness is never fully explored nhis actions seem arbitrary and his reasons for them not fully known npacinos comical portrayal is spirited but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie nthere is another plot or two that is introduced but never gets revisited nthe focus seemed inconsistent throughout and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap nthis movie tries to be horrifying thrilling and dramatic all at the same time nhowever while the devils advocate strives to get noticed ultimately it makes very little impression at all n
when walt disney pictures announced a liveaction feature based on the 60s cartoon series of mr magoo special interests groups representing the visionimpaired let out a cry of dismay nmr nmagoo they claimed would be an insult to the men and women they represented nin fact they were wrong nmr nmagoo is not just an insult to the blind and nearblind its an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny 90 minute atrocity nits stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas nlook at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases and youll see a shocking list of retreads including 101 dalmatians george of the jungle jungle2jungle that darn cat flubber and now mr nmagoo nthe best of these george of the jungle was mildly entertaining nthe worst mr nmagoo exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be nthe first problem with mr nmagoo is the script ndespite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft mr nmagoo is comically barren nfrom beginning to end theres not a laugh to be found nevery attempt at humor and there are lots of them falls flat with an audible thud nyoud think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film at least a few would work but thats not the case nive had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures nthen theres leslie nielsen who looks sounds and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character memorably voiced by jim backus nin the past nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun nlately however he has been getting lazy taking parts in the likes of dracula dead and loving it spy hard and mr nmagoo neven if nielsen was in top form it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo especially since were reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film but top form is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here nthis is strictly a takethemoneyand run operation nthe story which like many disney stories can be described in one long sentence magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum and as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own the police mistake him for the robber nthe cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky who take their lumps early and often nthe bad guys are kelly lynch who does a lot of martial artstype kicking nick chinlund and malcolm mcdowell who has the good sense to look embarrassed nmatt keeslar portrays one of magoos sidekicks his nephew waldo nthe bumbling mans other more interesting companion is a dog named angus nmost of mr nmagoos humor comes in the form of failed slapstick nthe cartoon violence level in this film doesnt approach that of home alone 3 or flubber but its still pretty acute with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices ntheres a nonviolent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better but compared to mr beans recent similar misadventure it doesnt hold up well nthen there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoos near blindness such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby nim willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack ntong a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market has helmed several jackie chan movies including first strike rumble in the bronx and supercop nhis chief talent that of choreographing martial arts fights is wasted here despite some high kicking by kelly lynch nlike john woo hard target and ringo lam maximum risk before him it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream nit is worth noting that unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under10 crowd while driving parents to distraction mr nmagoo appears to bore viewers of all ages nthe screening i attended was walltowall kids and for the most part they didnt seem to be enjoying themselves nwhen the film was over i asked one little girl what she thought of it nher pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words nmr nmagoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer sight unseen n
edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back and like his previous two it is a workingclass relationship picture nhowever unlike his previous work the film dwells on a more personal story and with a female protagonist nand in no looking back he stumbles making a slow boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work nclaudia lauren holly is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life nshes at a turning point in her life and feels as if shes going nowhere nher boyfriend michael jon bon jovi is broke and in a dead end job nif she were to marry him shed never get a chance to escape this town nenter charlie edward burns claudias old flame nhe skipped town several years before without any explanations even nfor claudia nhe has come back to town to see her and suddenly she is torn nshould she stay with stable michael and never escape her hometown or nshould she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again npart of the answer lies in the character of her mother blythe danner who fell for the wrong man and has spent her life pining for claudias father to return nnow it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes nat only a little past ninety minutes no looking back is rather short for its genre nunfortunately it seems much much longer nthe storyline is simple and uninspired and theres a lack of energy to the whole proceedings which makes the entire drama rather tedious nedward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame ntheres no one to restrain his ego which reigns unchecked nhe walks into the room and lauren holly swoons yeah nright nlauren holly does what she can with her central character nbut we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions and nwe never really care nbon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie nhis acting talents are much greater than they might seem but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with ntheres not much to recommend in no looking back nits not that the film is bad its nsimply boring ntheres no zest in any aspect of the film and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it n
when a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart it could mean one of two things that the recently overworked individual is due for a welldeserved rest or that either of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the timing is merely a coincidence nthe latters the case with john mctiernan and the thirteenth warrior which finally hits theatres a year and counting after its original spring 98 opening and fast on the heels of mctiernans the thomas crown affair remake a flick that got good reviews nyou dont have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that thirteenth wont be so lucky nreportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton whose eaters of the dead novel provides warrior s source and its initial title this messy melange of cultureclash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish sorta like braveheart without any of the passion nbut the bloodshed certainly remains theres enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness nthese circa10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside nthe good guys are loud crude often unintelligible and judging from their highly icky hygiene habits pretty smelly to boot which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador antonio banderas who tags along quite reluctantly ntheyre also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises nyoull wince youll groan youll grouse havent we seen this guy killed twice before nbanderas stands confused amidst the chaos partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animalskin fashion run amok nhes not the hero his soulful eyes and lean build dont exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions and the thirteenth warrior wisely doesnt pretend he is allowing his foreign and physically imposing costars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough nlet the characters interaction sans swords and shields however and theres still a struggle for the audience to follow or even care about the story nit isnt the end until audiences have witnessed a halfbaked romance murky political intrigue veteran actor omar sharif funny girl dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic indiana jones and the temple of doom esque chase through the villains underground lair nall this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr but the collaboration between die hard helmer mctiernan and jurrasic park creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights graphic action and unintentionally telling moments nheard during the thirteenth warrior s final scene a dog whimpering nhow appropriate n

according to the publicity material with this movie the directors hope to restore good oldfashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness nhmm nyou never know they just might be on to something nwhat with the rise of geek chic lounge music and seventies fashion the evercontrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own nbut then i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it nits cheesy all right but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch nthats a shame because in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more nwoody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise roy munson nthe movie opens in the fifties with roys dad dishing out the readers digestgumpian wisdom in scoopfuls shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever nthe sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken nits thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good he gives the wry derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy nmccracken dupes munson into a hustling job then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roys hand nthen its fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand nhes hopeless until he meets ishmael randy quaid an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege nso together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno picking up pretty hustler claudia vanessa angel on the way nwith the exit of bill murray the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go and thats ndumb and dumber nyes indeed kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour peter and bobby farrelly the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle nso prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands distended nipples ridiculous hair and bull semen nget set for stock fishoutofwater situations when cityboy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking striptease and unchristian neighboursocking nnow dont get me wrong theres nothing wrong with cheap humour and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy nthe trouble is that these jokes arent bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction nit lurches from sports movie to amishmocking to roadtrip to sentimental melodrama pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack never quite getting it all together nsome gags fall flat from a lack of buildup while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply dont do anything nwhy the long unfunny fight in the car park nwhy two of these nwhy does that guy wear mascara or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it nthe film is full of these halfthoughtthrough ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying wouldnt that be funny nwell no actually nthe actors dont do the movie much favours either nwoody harrelson comes off okay plausibly acting dumb smart cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham and vanessa angel has no talent like schwarzenegger she seems more convincing playing a computercreation than a human take the tv series weird science please n neven murray hams it up when he reappears in the movies climax nall in all a fairly useless attempt at comedy and a certified nohoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance nwell have to look to a reinspired john waters or perhaps somebody from down under strictly bowling anyone for the definitive bowling comedy nthe flying inkpots rating system wait for the video n a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha n pretty good bring a friend n amazing potent stuff n perfection nsee it twice n
one of my brothers favorite movies is h b halickis 1974 cult flick gone is sixty seconds one of the best products of the carchase genre that provided drivein fare during the 1970s nchase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue but they had a strong visceral appeal nalthough it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars the remake of gone in sixty seconds is relatively weak and dull nrandall memphis raines nicolas cage is a retired car thief who runs a gocart track nhe got out of crime so that his younger brother kip giovanni ribisi would not take up boosting cars nhowever kip became a thief anyway and now hes in big trouble nkip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri christopher eccleston by the end of the week ncalitri expects memphis to fulfill kips bargain if he doesnt come through kip dies nmemphis gathers his old crew angelina jolie robert duvall will patton chi mcbride and vinnie jones and kip brings his boys t j ncross william lee scott scott caan and james duval nas if calitri breathing down their necks wasnt bad enough the team is pursued by a cop delroy lindo whos still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster rap star master p who wants to take over calitris clients nwatching gone i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one nmaybe thats why the first fortynine are fairly easy and the thrills are saved for eleanor a 1967 shelby gto a model that has always eluded memphis nbut the big chase doesnt live up to the long wait ni had high hopes for gone because it is director dominic senas second film n kalifornia his 1993 debut was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience nin that movie sena took a simple thriller plot a couple gives a serial killer a ride and successfully endowed it with deeper significance nin gone he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who cant communicate with each other but that goal just doesnt mesh with this plot n gone either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough nits not light enough to be fun or mean enough to be intense nthis chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it nthe lack of action is a waste of the premise which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever nthe weak script is a waste of a talented cast nin a newsweek interview last year sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies nmuch as i like cage for every good picture he does leaving las vegas bringing out the dead there are two major stinkers snake eyes con air 8mm city of angels nthat ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast but cage has real talent nits a shame to waste it in glitzy superficial tripe like gone in 60 seconds n
about an hour or so into the jackal a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out i hope she gets killed now nat that point it hit me i didnt care for any of the characters being played by actors i didnt really like nwhen the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because hes being played by sidney poitier you know somethings rotten in the state of denmark nevery year a couple films like this are released nyou know the cheap action packed international espionnage film featuring a semipromising premise some bigname actors usually bruce willis and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago nthis was the third one of 97 following the very lackluster the saint which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe and the surprisingly fun the peacemaker featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain n the jackal tries to mix both elements nand you thought the saint was bad n the jackal is loosely very loosely i hope based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that ive yet to see the day of the jackal which featured apparently a suave hitman called the jackal played by edward fox trying to assasinate charles degaule nwell welcome to the 90s where a sorta suave hitman also called the jackal bruce willis trying to kill the head of the fbi or nis he nafter being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother killed in the opening scenes the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere from helsinki to virginia setting up an elaborate scheme wherein hell be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion nand like the saint the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people nthe agent working on the case cater preston sidney poitier yes that sidney poitier working with a russian agent valentina koslova diane venora lady capulet from romeo juliet gives up early on and meets with an exira man declan mulqueen richard gere putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of 97 whos in a massachusetts jail but who has apparently seen the jackal who has been eluding the law forever nsoon hes out working with the two untrusting agents and trying to help them catch him nthere are numerous problems with the film and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on nthe film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller but save a couple moments the film never achieves suspense or even a sense of intrigue nsure the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register nthe film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience or even an entertaining one nit doesnt help that the plot is designed to be complex but falls into so many problems like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances nthe script of the jackal is a complete mess mostly because it cant decide what it wants to focus on nis this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer nis it a film about a nasty amoral hitman whos in everything for the money nor is it a combination of both n the jackal aims for the latter but never focuses in on either character nthe connection between the two feels completely edited so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan you wonder how he recognized him so fast nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend isabella mathilda may given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then nthe supporting characters are worse nsidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role that of a man who is just stern sometimes and other times more giving and likable nwhat is poitier doing here nhes one of the best living actors ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ndiane venoras russian character is almost as bad with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth and a plastered on expressionless facade nits not that anyones bad here its that they have nothing to do nthe plot is a joke feeling like it was pasted together by someone in postproduction who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain nthere are several times where hes in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill ntake a scene where hes being followed by some agents into a parking garage he quickly sprays his car another color and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it ndoesnt killing someone attract more attention than it does distract nand does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ngeez nis there anything good here nwell a ncouple things ni did like williss icy expressions he may not have been real suave or anything but some of his looks are worth a chuckle nrichard gere has a couple of good moments making his character as likable as he possibly could have nand a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous completely inane but fun kinda way most notably a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder jack black and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man which has its share of a couple good jokes most particular a kiss by willis nbut none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go theyre just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is the jackal ndirector michael catonjones who directed the far superior rob roy has made a film that is made very couple months one that is unentertaining unintriguing and pretty much cold but will nevertheless make money because hey the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retroclancy kinda way nevery now and then the filmmakers get it right clear and present danger which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way but the jackal is an example of when they go completely wrong n
often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into the call of the oboe o toque do oboe is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray nmany elements of the film are solid and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know but they simply dont convert into a solid work nalthough a setting is never established it becomes apparent nthe film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day nthe community is a dull one where every day is a downhill slide from the last nover time the people have taken to themselves nthe town cinema is closed no tourist has passed through in years and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger nso what happens when a tourist paolo betti does arrive one day nhe sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock nit is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby nwhen he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years nit is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages nthe woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner leticia vota who also happens to be engaged to the towns police inspector a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiances involvement with this musician nthe rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray nit features a character who literally rises from his grave a woman who has a phone conversation with god and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character to an almost humorous drunk ntechnically this film is a nightmare nthe music score is poorly edited into the film so it is often choppy rough and abrupt nthe lighting is poor at best which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases nthis translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words nin addition the pace of the film seems uneven nit opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test ones patience nthe film then moves into a faster pace that again slows towards the end as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark nthere was however potential for this film nit is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music and the reunification of people nthese are all topics that could easily fill a movie nperhaps if there were no freak show and the technical aspects were to improve there might just be a thing of beauty at the end nmost importantly though the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours arent such a bore nuntil then there seems to be little more hope for this piece than that boy has by simply crying out mommy while he wanders astray in a park n

this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disneys live action george of the jungle ntarzan and the lost city the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burroughs legendary hero to the big screen is one of the most inept and illtimed of any tarzan adventure so far nbadly conceived and poorly executed tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves ni have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan its not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie nfurthermore its even more curious that this film is rated pg which by definition rules out any sex or explicit violence nand while im not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production nof course no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city since the films troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line nimagine george of the jungle stripped of all intentional humor and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like nwith its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences the film barely registers a pulse nanyone in search of a relatively entertaining family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book which uses the same basic elements to much better effect nthe only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery which unfortunately includes the two lead actors nthe film doesnt attempt to retell the origin story the thinking is that it has been done often enough ninstead tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a k a john clayton a k a tarzan the ape man casper van dien several days before his marriage to lady jane porter jane march nhe is living happily in england enjoying the benefits of being a landowning noble nmeanwhile in central africa the dastardly nigel ravens steven waddington a selfproclaimed scholar and explorer believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar which he calls the cradle of civilization non the way there he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things like burning native villages to earn the wrath of the locals none shaman determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal sends a mystical message to tarzan for help nwith lady jane following close behind he returns to the jungle where he was born nits patently obvious that casper van dien one of the prettyboy heroes of starship troopers was not hired on the basis of his acting ability nwith his plastic facial expressions monotone voice and complete inability to make convincing animal noises his range rivals that of steven seagal nhis pecs however are impressive and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off njane march on the other hand has to keep her shirt on which may be a first for her nsome six years ago march give a solid performance in jean jacques annauds steamy the lover nsince then she made the careerkilling decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night which exploited her every acting defiency ntarzan continues this trend nmarch may be attractive but at least judging by this performance she cant act nmeanwhile steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy ninstead he turns out to be little more than a nuisance nthe story line is pure formula which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies nthe problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless nthe romantic elements are all contrived in fact lady janes presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance nthe special effects are truly bottomofthebarrel including some laughably bad men in ape costumes apparently animatronics were too expensive for this production nand of course as with all jungle movies there are the obligatory cute animals nover the years the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material nthe most famous ape man was johnny weismuller but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part including gordon scott who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role nweismuller made 12 tarzan features van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number nand having seen tarzan and the lost city i would argue that the moviegoing public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 n
after enduring mariah careys film debut glitter im reminded of a bit from chris rocks bigger and blacker nin response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man rock says you can drive a car with your feet but that dont mean it should be done nto that i say you can give mariah carey a movie but that certainly dont mean it should be done nsure there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there from the beatles a hard days night to the spice girls spice world but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter neverything about this complete tripe is ludicrous nstart off with the story which as gruesomely predictable as it is is the least offensive part of the movie nthe film is inexplicably set in the 80s a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers nworse yet everyones speaking late 90s hiphop slang in what should be 1983 nmeant to be partially autobiographical carey plays billie frank a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother ninfluential club dj julian dice a k a lucky 7 max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro hears her sing on a track and decides to make her a star nin predictably rapid succession billie and dice fall for each other she starts hitting it big dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass and suddenly billies on the roller coaster of superstardom nin the meantime billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom ni wont give away the ending but honestly just think of unicorns and rainbows nyoull figure it out nthe movie screams to be made with camp and that couldve been fun nbut the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better nwhat a mistake nthe brief attempts at comic relief as in a scene where an effeminate russiansounding director gets wacky with filming billies first music video go over like lead balloons ninstead the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariahs most dramatic scenes nwhich brings us to the performances of which theres nothing good that can be said nmariah is primarily seen with a wideeyed deerintheheadlights look frozen on her face nshe actually looks scared during her one love scene nbut you have to wonder if the writing isnt even worse nso much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for careys virginal target audience that its probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb neven the characters couldnt have been written more absurdly ntheyre all members of a barbie playset the important film director who swoons billie id love to put you in a movie im making and the bigtime record executive who takes billies demo tape and says oh ill make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning neveryone in the film is a device and its painful to keep watching just to see another one appear nto say more would be a waste ntheres so much wrong with this film nand it pains me that mariah carey with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays will have to suffer through all the negative reviews shes likely to get nbut then again i had to suffer through her movie n

it was with a huge lack of something to do that i decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon when the only good things on tv are the secondrate movies they show some are good they showed total recall before this one nif you know me i think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live nand this includes keanu reeves nwhat do i hate about seagal ni hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and nonthreatening situation the squint ni hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around bullying people up saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynolds hairpiece in boogie nights ni despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights ni hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain ni hate his nonsatirical messages in the beginning of this one he slaps on a quote from arthur miller which has nothing to do with the film except its about brooklyn where this film takes place nand i hate how hes so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing during the end credits he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him nsure the guys probably a nice guy in person i actually found him very nonthreatening when he was on letterman not too long ago nbut the guy makes worse films than reagan did nso whats the plot of this shitterpiece nwell something nabout him trying to catch a stupidass crook william forsythe who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight ni couldnt believe how bad this scene was the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ahem nand forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off nim sorry did anyone ever hear of concealing ones self nso in comes exbrooklynite seagal who dedicates his life to catching this guy nand i just wished he had caught him in the beginning then ended the film nbut noooo this drags on as he bullies forsythes family members including a stupid barowner and none other than gina gershon as his other barowner sister nand forsythe more than once threatens his family nat one point he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a nonthreatening nicholson in the shining complete with them all hiding in the bathroom but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away nseagal paints himself as a lovable person with a son and a fiancee nhe even shows him hanging with his son checking up on his homework and then about to take him out for a bit of catch when hes conveniently called away on assignment ni dunno about you but playing catch with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares nhe also shows him as that badass he wants to be with scenes of him bullying crooks around and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after hes unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue nserves them right nthis film as some of his do has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented but dont appear to be in this film ni already mentioned gina gershon whos pretty horrible in this one as well as william forsythe who overacts terribly ni know this guy can act he was awesome in raising arizona as goodmans partner in crime nbut hes just awful here njerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down nwhy is he the only one who gives a good performance nwell because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility nhe seems to be in here just to give it a cool law and order feeling even if its not a cool feeling nand in cameos are brated eroticthrillercinemaxstyle stars shannon whirry as terry malloy which is more of a bad joke than a clever one and athena massey noh nand er s julliana margiulles has two scenes n out for justice just proves once again that american action films just suck ni know that theres such a good thing as good action hes called john woo nbut if youre in the mood for some good old nobrainer funyetdumb action dont bother watching this nits so stupid that its boring n
 the following review contains spoilers n its just nthe way nwe are n a rapist matt frewer responds to supergirls helen slater query as to why shes being attacked an example of the mindnumbingly bad dialogue in supergirl nill admit it ni love superman iii ni know its hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor but i still think its a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise nsupergirl a spinoff film of sorts from the series same producers alexander and ilya salkind doesnt even rival superman iii in terms of quality let alone superman or superman ii nsupergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time nas the film begins we see the residents of argo city a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in inner space go about their daily lives nok nwhat nso these are exiles from krypton which blew up right nwere they living there before krypton exploded nhow do you get to inner space nthis whole inner space notion is never explained particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world nhow do they know where superman went nhow do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet nthese kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me nargo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron none day the founder of argo city zaltar peter o toole gives the omegahedron to supermans cousin kara helen slater for use as inspiration in her art nkara uses it to create a buglike thing which immediately crashes through the layer of whatever that protects the city nin the chaos the omegahedron sails out through the opening dooming the argonians to death nin three days time or something nkara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world nthe power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minorleague witch named selena faye dunaway who immediately before her dip was ruined announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel peter cook nselena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans and she sets out to achieve world domination nselena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth and that shes arrived as supergirl complete with appropriate costume nsupergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives nok nhuh nwhy does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake nattention movie explain yourself nim sorry i can only suspend disbelief so much ni cant buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to nknowing that she needs a secret identity supergirl basically wills herself into a school girl outfit complete with a different hairstyle picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school nshes given her dorm assignment and who happens to be her roommate nlois lanes sister lucy nok coincidence is one thing folks but were getting really contrived now nwhat follows are some generic allgirls school hijinks ncomplete with evil bully girls mean for no reason of course and even a shower scene nbest moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks nat this point im rapidly wondering why im bothering with this nonsense nthere is some credit to give to the film however none lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an evil bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its prey is very well done nalso its commendable to see genders reversed in the film whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools nhart bochner die hard is particularly fun as karas love interest a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena although he is unfortunately part of one of the films more ridiculous moments when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some menacing bumper cars nthen there were numerous little things that bothered me nthe flying effects are never convincing for a moment nits all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires ninstead of having her look like shes flying the filmmakers wanted her to be graceful so she poses a lot and does ballettype maneuvers nalso who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth na pair of truck driversrapists who immediately attack her and then meet a wacky demise nthere is also some rampant product placement in the film most notably for popeyes tylenol and aw root beer with the latter actually putting its logo on the tshirt of one of the rapists nfinally just one word monsters nfaye dunaway and peter otoole ham it up unmercifully however when otoole overacts hes entertaining and when dunaway does it shes annoying her character actually says the line seize them nat one point ndunaways henchmen played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro fare much better with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beattys otis character from the first two superman movies nhelen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent naive character shes written to be as shes able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable nbelievability aside though its still annoying nnow despite all this negativity and im not alone here supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested but excited about its release on dvd nthey have released two separate editions of the film on dvd to the delight of many people including myself nyet im still unclear as to why since this movie is so awful nthe first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u s theaters nthe movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 35 1 is enhanced for 16x9 televisions and has been remastered in full thx glory nextras on the disc include a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and special project consultant scott michael bosco the excellent 50minute documentary from 1984 called supergirlthe making of a feature dig that workout montage 5 trailers 3 tv spots talent bios indepth storyboards accompanied by score from the movie and assorted still galleries nthe transfer on this international version is incredible nyoud think you were watching a new release nimages are sharp colors jump off the screen and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts nonly some special effects sequences show the wear of time and there just isnt much that can be done about that unless youre obsessive like george lucas nthe new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places however youll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score which is completely unrelated to john williams classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films golanglobus production nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that theres no dead air on the track nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation nalthough at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc and is surprised when he doesnt get that response nwe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track most notably the almost appearance in the film by christopher reeve ngreat detail is given about supermans proposed role in the original script before reeve wisely dropped out nas it stands superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission nfor the sake of brevity i wont even get into that one nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds and everyone else agreed that supergirl needed to stand on its own replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy whimsical fantasy nonsense nbosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office nagain for the sake of brevity i wont even get into that one nanchor bay has also released a limited edition only 50 000 copies pressed twodisc set ndisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release ndisc two features the never before seen directors cut of the film which runs 138 minutes long nthe additions mainly consist of scene extensions which dont add much of note except for a few moments which lengthen peter otooles screen time particularly during his latter appearances nthe print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono but fans of the film wont care none question though nshouldnt the directors commentary be on the directors cut of the film nid never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd ni was nine when it was released to theaters and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it nso when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect ni knew the film wasnt beloved and i never had any interest in it before but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc nas the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong ncome to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo nso i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started nat the end of the film supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron and flies back to argo city nugh i give up nim surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once not twice but three times to review these discs nsupergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package but a very lousy movie npg

i suppose its unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since its 1991 release nmichael lehmanns actioncomedy was quick to win the title biggest box office flop of all time or close thereof nthe movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk whos just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation let me put it this way he explains i never saw et ngreeting him is his old friend and partner in crime played by danny aiello who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes nthese are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences nit appears as if director lehmann didnt know when to stop all the absurd silliness and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line nif at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldnt get goofier youll soon be eating your words nbut im inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as its box office numbers suggest nits fastpaced and entertaining if youve got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor nfor the first portion of this review im going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk nwish me luck nfirst and foremost bruce willis is a good sport nwhile im not entirely sure what he was smoking when he cowrote this script willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big fat ugly joke nhe constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and outofplace which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions nanother plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character nthey meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican and their relationship escalates in interest from there nits unfortunate that mcdowells onenote character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plottwist and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis nbut now im rambling on again about the negative things arent i nenough of the charade for the most part hudson hawk is an excruciating experience nits stupid pointless and repetitive ni can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater because this film really doesnt have the potential to please anyone naction fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90 comedy and even the action sequences are skittery rushed and poorly edited nand those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headacheinducing hijinks ndont get me wrong this film is not devoid of laughs nits too bad most of them are unintentional or just plain forced nthe impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed nits understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn im not entirely sure ncoburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie nespecially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film nthings get more bizarre when were introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless cardflipping kitkat nif thats not enough for you theres richard e grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover ntheir crotchbiting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here nwait maybe the only big laughs nim not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk ni cant even begin to start about the films absurd plot but lets not get into that ni suppose theres some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise if they were that desperate nbut hudson hawk never even has a clue of where its going from minute one and from there its 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck n
to put it bluntly ed wood would have been proud of this na totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor hokey drama zero logic and a crap screenplay nalso a beautifully anticlimactic ending nnot to say it didnt look intriguing when i saw the previews nso much for truth in advertising nroland emmerich whos later independence day would look like the 400 blows compared to this cowrited and directed this inane scifi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens nin a useless opening sequence men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it nit wouldnt be till present day 94 till they would actually figure it out ntheyre decipherer na slightlyneurotic scientist nice twist dr dan jackson james spader doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare whos life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word nwhy do they use him to decipher what no one else could nso there is a hokey ending nduh nhe figures it out in about a minute nyea nand then they get a suicidal colonel or something jack oneill kurt russel with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flattop that would make howie long snap into a fetal position nwhy a suicidal colonel nfor the ending nyoull get the hang of this nthey open the stargate a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad nafter an overdone special effects thing theyre inside a goddam pyramid nso they went to egypt right nwrong ntheyre on another planet that was filmed in egypt nthey discover a cilvilization ruled by ra the sun god the androginous jaye davidson with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma and there are fights explosions and a kiss between two people nyea nalso melodrama stupidity hokey scenes and a bizarre language nan anticlimactic ending ends with stupid lines say hello to king tut asswhole n the quintessential line lemme tell ya and some convenient pesudopseudopseudocharacter development nby the end you just wanna go home and watch i dont know the outer limits or something nthe scripts terrible nthe special effects are okay but nothing great nthe storys so weak that its almost opaque nthe whole experience just isnt worth it unless youre so bored that youd consider watching a full house marathon or nthis nid pick this obviously but still its just not fun at all nand i cant wait for it to premier on mst3k n

im guessing and from the available evidence its not a great guess that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess stupidity ego and powermongering nif so the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history nit has already been welldocumented that the original title an alan smithee film became a problem when miserable test screenings forced recuts against the will of director arthur hiller prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors guildmandated pseudonym of alan smithee nthat left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor nand you could just smell the disaster brewing nif youre unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn youll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up nostensibly its a pseudodocumentary account of a director named alan smithee eric idle who loses control of a bigbudget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone whoopi goldberg and jackie chan all of whom appear as themselves nwhen the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called an alan smithee film which of course it already is smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it namong the parties interviewed are the films producer james edmunds ryan oneal and studio boss jerry glover richard jeni who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them nits bad enough that burn hollywood burn has literally not a single laugh for its entire blissfully brief 84 minutes nwhat makes it even worse is eszterhas insistence upon telling every bad joke not once but twice or even three times nmichael ovitz references showgirls references oral sex references whoopi goldbergted danson references all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas stockintrade nthe reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency notably with the hilarious use of the word feminist as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film nby the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent filmmakers the brothers brothers cleverly identified as bad a and badder a among other unprintable things you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified nthose documentary captions for all their leaden obviousness allow the best insight into whats so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn nnot content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears nthe producer is a liar who slept in the white house the media are maggots and leeches working for publications like the new york slimes and newsleak with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you dont miss the joke nit doesnt even matter that eszterhas tags penile implant after his own name when he makes a cameo because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign selfdeprecation nthis is a petulant schoolboys idea of satire pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth nthe last stomachchurning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with outtakes over the closing credits the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away nperhaps it was just a final desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career npity everyone involved with this excessive egodriven satire of excess and ego nits too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this notherwise you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees n
i had an epiphany today nit occurred to me while i was watching house on haunted hill nit is as follows if a trailer makes the film its advertising look like a trashy stupid movie well guess what nchances are there is truth in advertising ntoo bad i didnt trust my own instincts when somethingortheother possessed me to see this movie ni blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of sleepy hollow nthat and dogma started too late in the afternoon for my schedule nan hour of angel or buffy is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face ni wish id seen it when it was halloween nat least i would have been forgiving nhey tis the season nthe movie was scary albeit very confusing dizzying and nauseating at first but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasnt going anywhere nnow i truly appreciate films like scream halloween or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic nthats what spooks people out the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know nthere has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with nsure utterly unpredictable is good too but thats different from utterly nonsensical nhohh house on haunted hill on the other hand n n nwell lets just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they ohsocleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago nriiiiight nyknow that just sends chills down my spine nyeah njust like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil nooooooo nhint blood and guts only work a few times nsooner or later people start to tell themselves that its just ketchup and props and youve got to come up with something better than that nthere were just too many things in this movie that weve all seen before from the inevitable plot developments of strangers unwittingly trapped together strangers turning against each other the evil manifesting itself the dead coming back for a last scare neach was more predictable than the last nwhy didnt these fools just stay together in one place anyways nsheesh nwas i grossed out nyes ndid i get spooked a few times nyes nbut why ni get really disturbed when there is no why nwhen there werent random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect which wasnt that good either trust me and the scare the film was filled with drab laughable dialogue nthe characters were incredibly flat and cliched nnot to mention downright annoying nyouve got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives of course theyre dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night njeez i thought no one fell for those you may already be a winner things anymore nand of course all three gals are babes ni wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of shine ended up in this movie nkeep that up geoff and youll qualify for the next batman venture nthe only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because well he just cracks me up nand famke jansen sp nbecause she reminds me of the delectable brosnan npierce brosnan hey i willingly endured dantes peak three times for him nall right i concede nthere were a couple of things i enjoyed nthat perverted little amusement park at the beginning ni probably wont ride a rollercoaster for a while nand the machine they used to drive geoffreys character mad see i dont even remember their names nthe machine not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it ni kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie nit wouldnt have redeemed the film but at least it would have made me feel better nbut no they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending nthank god they didnt add a kiss at the end or i would have puked ngod there is no hope n
the scene at the end of 1989s dead poets society when robin williams english students stand up on their desk and say captain my captain gets me every time nunfortunately the court room scene near the end of robins newest film patch adams doesnt have anywhere near the same impact nfrom the surface patch adams looks very promising nits a story about a not so young man patch adams robin williams who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people nwhen the film opens we find patch depressed and suicidal checking himself into a mental hospital nin a few scenes strongly reminiscent of one flew over the cuckoos nest he ends up helping the patients through their problems and its here that he finds how much he loves working with people nso he checks himself out of the hospital and heads straight to medical school nright from the start patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable nhe continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry nshortly after joining medical school he meets and falls in love with carin monica potter nthey along with patchs dork friend truman daniel london start a medical clinic for uninsured people nonce the dean catches wind of the clinic he tells patch he cant graduate and kicks him out of school npatch like what any true american would do takes the school to court nits here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place over whether or not patch can become a real doctor ni have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it nit seems more like a series of short sketches rather than a fulllength movie nconsidering it runs almost two hours much too long for such a light film it could have flowed much smoother nnot to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama nrobin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels nbut those moments are rare and in the end patch adams is barely average n

this movie stinks nalthough it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss ni knew i was in for trouble when during the opening establishment shots we see a detailed closeup of warrant officer paul brenners john travolta military identification card and it is the wrong color nthis might seem like a minor detail but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow nand what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training nor what about when brenner tells a suspect that because he is in the military he doesnt have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision nhow hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts nnow details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through nfor example at the beginning of the film paul brenner an undercover army investigator gets into a gun and knife battle at his offpost houseboat and windsup killing an arms dealer he had been investigating nthe local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing nbut instead of arresting him or at least take him into custody for further questioning they release him nduh nultimately brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding generals daughter a young captain also assigned to the post nwhen brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the generals daughter does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects nno his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing neventually brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier ni wont even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the armys suppression of this horrendous crime ni will just mention one final flaw nbrenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia nthe rape occurred in west point which is in new york nhe is under a very tight and totally implausible 36hour deadline to solve this case nhe needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point ndoes he phone the doctor nno he travels via some unexplained very fast transport to new york to question the psychiatrist in person and then he returns to georgia again by the miracle transport without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline nyou have been warned stay away from this one n

fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade ntragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies but the quantity nmost of those movies were produced by cannon group company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus nthose two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman b movie mentors of future hollywood legends nunfortunately that didnt happened and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal nsadly for bronson that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead and lowering his own reputation in process non the other hand bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself none of such movies that seriously marred bronsons reputation is death wish 3 third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 nin the original movie bronson played paul kersey mildmannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence nthat movie was far from masterpiece yet in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry nunfortunately six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels even the presence of its original director didnt stop the rapid decline of the quality ndeath wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend living in the urban wasteland of east new york populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out nbefore the reunion kerseys friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker played by gavan oherlihy probably the only noteworthy role in the film nkersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade while the police inspector shriker ed lauter ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime nbronson the main asset in this movie plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine nalthough bronsons charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower the lack of emotions or bronsons own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film nthe movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness so they added romantic interest for their hero public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kerseys crusade non the other hand emotions are much better played by confronting lawabiding yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey nunfortunately michael winner doesnt know how to work out the plot and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations ends this movie with a bang nthe big showdown at the end that turns east new york into the sarajevolike battle zone is probably the worst part of the movie because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget nin short this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia n special note for trekkies marina sirtis the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife n
the 13th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canines least appetizing residue nthe best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector nmy vote goes for the ending credits where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you nibn fahdlan antonio banderas is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another mans wife nhe encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men nfahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter nthe movie proves to be a new low point for banderas whos acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying gay man in 1993s philadelphia than that of a warrior nin the films supposed pay off scene he exclaims i was wrong these are not men na line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production nunfortunately banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chases career look like oscar material nthe film based on michael crichtons best selling novel eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three years ago and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow nat the same time the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions nquestions like why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark n why does no one ever have blood cover both sides of their face but rather just one side nand finally will the manager give me a refund n90 minutes into the 103 minute film a man invites of the warriors come with me there is a woman who can help nunfortunately there is nothing that could help this film nthe most appropriate ending would have been for the 13 men to join hands form a chorus line and break into a rendition of springtime for hitler n
im a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamsons work nhe always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain nwith teaching mrs tingle his directorial debut williamson has reached the end of his rope nwhat used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here nthe components are all there including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to nbut where are the thrills nthe laughs nboth are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge nand what a shame that is ni loved the scream films heck i even enjoyed the scifi goofiness of the faculty nkevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office nteaching mrs tingle a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers may put an end to his reign nor perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties ni still have my faith but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past nthe title character of his pet project is a vicious uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously overthetop by british actress helen mirren nmrs tingle is basically every students worst nightmare a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hardworking of her pupils nthe principal michael mckean is horrified of her and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members ni enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way nmirrens performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink nin other words its a poor substitute for williamsons best work nthe plot is a big problem here nmaterial that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director nthe likable katie holmes plays leigh ann an overachiever hoping to get a college scholarship nbut typical mrs tingle says her history project which she worked on for countless hours is laughable nlater on while studying in the gymnasium a classmate barry watson offers her a photocopied duplicate of mrs tingles final exam nleigh anns best friend marisa coughlan encourages her to use it nalas the old hag herself finds the three scheming and snatches the test and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning nin the morning nhow convenient nthe three students head to mrs tingles house attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh anns name nthings get out of hand and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle nthe plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her nof course not everything goes entirely to plan nbesides pointless subplots involving the football coach jeffrey tambor horribly wasted there is little by way of actual progress nthere is no urgency to the situation little tension or laughs are involved nthe humor is completely inconsistent nafter many of the jokes the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze nyou continue to await some momentum in the story something that could possibly revive the slow pace na moment like that never arises nwilliamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players including the talented mckean and larry sanders vet tambor nand the beautiful vivica a fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor and then williamson disposes of her character entirely non the plus side holmes and coughlan are admirable with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher nwhile everything is pretty lifeless teaching mrs tingle remains watchable nthere are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script nmirren is easily the best reason to keep watching nshe is convincingly evil and fun to watch but even her gifted delivery cant save individual scenes that flounder in boredom nif there is one word for the movie surrounding her it would be disappointing nbasically kevin williamson is his worst enemy here nhis uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated not that his writing here is especially good nwe will see when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas whether williamson is for real n
movies like six days seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford anne heche and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents nthe script was written by michael browning and he decided that instead of thinking up new ideas hed rehash a lot of cliches omit even the slightest bit of character development and then throw in drugdealing pirates to provide for a few highlevel action sequences and explosions nthere are good scripts out there that highprofile actors can make see the truman show for instance nsix days seven nights is simply a waste nlets see n n nwe have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island nso how do we do that nwell well make her a feisty magazine editor and well make him a crusty old pilot nbut wait she has to have a fianc e that can be david schwimmer nbut wait if she has a fianc e how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone ni know ntheyll get to their vacation spot and then shell get called back nyessssss nso theyll crash on the island and that will be funny for about five minutes nshucks noh ive got it nwell throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo and then he can feel guilty nthen when anne heche kisses harrison ford they have to kiss because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie it will be a vindicated action because her fianc e will already have cheated on her nthen for no obvious reason theyll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them noh yes ni feel so good about this story ninstead of using characterization to propel the events it will be completely random and yet totally predictable nimagine that ndont get me wrong six days seven nights is not a boring picture ford and heche both do a great job nthe sparks fly between them and so most of brownings inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors sheer force of talent n almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen and i found myself laughing pretty hard nschwimmer is also funny and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get nand reitman who has made some good films at least tries to make things exciting neven though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences nits just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces nthe picture feels like its been hacked to pieces i wouldnt be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely nthe ones that are here are as bad as they come i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships and id just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream why did you pick this awful script nthe film is outright stupid but some of the elements are subtly horrifying nfor instance take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo and then feels really guilty nthis is a serious problem in real life but six days seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford nin a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story nthis is summer movie season but that doesnt mean our movies have to be dumb n1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters nwhen i was in line for six days seven nights i heard the woman in front of me ask for two tickets to that new harrison ford movie n why didnt she know the name of the film ni suppose she just didnt care n what bothers me even more is that the people who make these bigbudget pictures dont realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves ngood actors should sign to good scripts and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash they least they could do is assume that wed like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents n
some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time nplaying god asks just one simple eensy teensy thing so it can fully entertain you its accomplished in just four easy to follow steps crack open your skull scoop out your brain squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one ncongratulations you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing nsome movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie others are simply good ideas that are badly executed nthen theres playing god which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of ripoffs or homages as they like to call it from other better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet nharsh maybe njustified nhell yes nthis is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes nfor example a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away nthis does look moderately kool but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling oooh look look njohn woo ntwo guns blazing nslooooow motion nand if that wasnt enough you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie npoor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines you have to admire the effort he puts into it this guy deserves better nunlike most movies this one does not suffer from stupid bad guy syndrome just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes nexample duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages nnow the bad guy is like stoned man so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero n term used as loosely as possible nsurvival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun which our hero does but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds neven when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger nmind you ive never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs be he stoned or not nsome will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct the hell with that ntwo fbi guys have just been shot in front me along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second nsolution nboom nill take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much nanother prime example of the idiot hero syndrome nour boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her nhe knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers nhe still has his shotgun bring it along you say nno thanks ill just ditch it in the back of my car nand the real kicker is this when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised nwhile we are on the subject of getting shot why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door nive got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door nask mr wild bill the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life nthis is the major problem with this movie any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better nis it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters nfor instance nour heroes hide at duchovnys summer home now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment nok this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time nbut see our hero is a drug addict and guess what nhe chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt noh sure hell be really impressive when the bad guys come calling ngoing clean is really honorable of him but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun nfor an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton plot holes the size of godzilla getting our intelligence insulted and several oh come on nmoments n

 knock off is exactly that a cheap knock off of an action movie nits also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year ni figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 but alas it has already been found njeanclaude van damme stars as i think a designer jeans executive who discovers his halfbrother has been supplying him with cheaper goods nrob schneider plays van dammes partner and rochon plays nactually i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be nshe just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there nmany things are not explained in this film but i do know that for some bizarre reason van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick nwhere chan comes off as endearing in his normal guy character seen in many of his films van damme just comes off as a wimp nwere never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions nto be more clear i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie and even then it was not made too clear nthe film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong ntsui hark who directed van dammes last movie the bad but not nearly as bad as this double team never lets the camera rest for a second and thats no exaggeration nwe are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van dammes foot entering a shoe nfabulous nseriously though i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions as long as they dont get carried away nfor example look at sam raimi n army of darkness one of his best movies features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story nthats a concept that tsui cant seem to grasp nthe special effects and outrageous camera angles rule knock off to the point where the audience doesnt have a clue as to whats happening any more nanother problem with the film is that it looks cheap nthe film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night nand for some inexplicable reason everyones voice seems to have been dubbed neven the stars nand even the special effects seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about are inconsistent nfor example there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window nthe car slams into the ground and the left wheel is completely destroyed nseconds later the car drives off at full speed nhey i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie but a line must be drawn somewhere nfinally the acting nnobody gives a good performance in this film nvan damme an actor i usually like is way off the mark playing everyman nand schneider here to provide comic relief i assume is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene neven the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly overthetop performance as nonce again i have no idea who he was supposed to be nin case i havent yet made it clear enough knock off is the worst movie of van dammes career and possibly the worst movie of the decade nand its not even one of those movies thats so bad its funny nits too inept to be funny nthere are no redeeming factors in knock off and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased n
this film is extraordinarily horrendous and im not going to waste any more words on it n
confucius once said governing a nation is like cooking a small fish dont overdo it nhis maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make ngranted mike judge writerdirector of the workplace satire office space isnt exactly an amateur his most infamous work the mtv series beavis and butthead was pure gold for its network nbut unfailingly judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground nthe iffiness in judges plot a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss is not in its appeal nin fact based on the popularity of scott adams cartoon dilbert which will soon have its own television series a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood nunfortunately the concept lends itself to skitlength sequences which would be more at home on the set of saturday night live rather than a fulllength feature nthe most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space which feature almost all of the movies top content this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated nother evidence of office spaces failure to work are its lack of good jokes nthe comedy is marginally funny at best but not enough to get a packed house of theatergoers to laugh out loud nthe material in the movie is onkey for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting and this could partially explain his work here nhowever the movie is loaded with too many misfires including the token plot to allow for any excuse nthe plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers headed up by peter gibbons ron livingston at a company named initech nafter the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech the movie introduces us to two consultants john c mcginley and paul willson which are in charge of downsizing the companys payroll nwhen peter and his gang learns of this as well as the reason behind it so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh gary cole s stock will go up they set about creating a plan to see his downfall nthe circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but na sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer anistonasloveinterest subplot are all that keep this one together but its definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent n
a sensuous romantic comedy about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom nthere is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out its the kind of stuff ive seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny nthe film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen lope cruz who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot but who cant get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story npen lope was wonderful in pedro almod vars all about my mother but here she is so visible in such a stale story where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking that she somehow looks ridiculous as if she got egg all over her face nthe best you can say about her is that shes not to blame for this picture being so off nthis exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex is in my opinion worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will nthe story is all about the love motion sickness and cooking ability of isabella cruz who is born in bahia brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents cook nto cure her motion sickness her parents tried every remedy until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure nshe is able to control it now as long as she doesnt drive a car ride elevators follow in dancing and is the woman on top when making love nin other words she has to be in control of things nin her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter toninho oliveira murilo ben cio and marries him nthey open up a successful restaurant where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it even though hes a loafer none night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco nwe dont see her in flight so i cant tell how she handled her motion sickness problem unless she flew the plane nshe visits her friends apartment monica harold perrineau jr who is a crossdresser blending right into the san francisco scene nto cast away her love for the irresistible toninho she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell freeing her from ever loving him again nher luck changes when a local tv producer cliff mark feurerstein gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show nyou can really write the script from here on by yourself as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had but things continue to go bad for him there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village there is no chef to replace his wife as the restaurant is about to close for good nso he comes to san francisco figuring he can charm her again nhe brings along with him his guitar playing musicians the ones he used when courting her when he serenaded her under her window nhe sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick the yuppie tv producer chasing after her and sees that she is no longer charmed by him nwhen he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her the ratings go up and hes hired as a regular on the show nthe show gets so big that the network honchos come onboard taking it national nbut they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show get rid of monica because hes a freak have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses and they change her ethnic dresses to lowcut vanna white type of sexy dresses ncliff her wouldbe boyfriend acts creepy and sides with the network bigshots even though he loved everything she did nthese tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos they were revolting nit was an insult to ones intelligence nim sure that im not spoiling the ending for anyone when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again nif the film wasnt terrible enough monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers nit was so awkwardly done that it had no sense of truth or humor to it nthis film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film because it doesnt look or feel like an almod var film the type of film it aspired to be but more like a film that was interferred with from above nits more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic as it searches for box office heaven n
funny how your expectations can be defeated and not in good ways nthe ghost and the darkness promised at least it seemed to me to promise a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature nwhat it delivered was mystery science theater 3000level material an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters n get new jobs nwas one line if i remember correctly nat the end of the 19th century col patterson val kilmer whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda nhe is having immensely stereotypical problems the natives are restless his boss is a jerk and now two maneating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off npatterson tries to handle the situation himself incompetently and then turns to charles remington michael douglas a hunter of world reknown or something like that nthe movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions they should have gotten top billing and costarred with siegfried and roy nthey are nighinvulnerable as one comic book put it and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature ngive me a break nthe movie hasnt got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas its just trying to find convenient ways to stall us neven the lion hunts themselves are idiotic nget this remingtons big plan is to build a large scaffoldlike structure in the middle of the savannah sit on it and wait for the lion to show up nhe does this and then gets knocked off by a bird nby the end of the movie the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand nthe acting is forgettable ndouglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow but its nothing he hasnt done before nkilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else somewhere else and the rest vanish into the cinematography nthe camera by the way sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent nwhat did i expect from this movie ni dunno nsome real excitement i suppose na sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation nno such luck ni dug out my tattered copy of hemingways the short happy life of francis macomber and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind n
there is a rule when it comes to movies na sequel is never as good as the original nthere are very few exceptions to this rule and texas chainsaw massacre the next generation is not one of them nnow if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie and that this isnt even the first sequel to it you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience ndont be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey a time to kill and renee zellweger jerry maguire nthey made this movie before they were stars njudging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons nits a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey napparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger napparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day nand i dont blame them they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them nunfortunately for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character nwhile mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control n hey dont say i didnt warn you nto make matters worse leatherface the chainsaw wielding maniac who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times has now become a full blown crossdresser and spends the entire movie in drag nthere is a plot to this movie but it isnt worth mentioning nlets just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man mcconaughey and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving halfwitted sidekick nman i cant get over just how bad this movie is nthis film has absolutely no redeeming qualities neven the obligatory topless babe shot wasnt enough to hold my interest for more than 2 seconds nthe writing is bad the direction is even worse but both of those things look good in comparison to the acting nthis is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch na guarantee you if criminals thought that they would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again n
dirtywork has a premise of deliciously meanspirited potential nmitch weaver norm macdonald and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna artie lange are losers in life they were constantly picked on in school and now they cannot hold regular jobs nbut as the trailer goes there is one thing mitch weaver is good atrevenge nso he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in gettingeven schemes into a marketable revengeforhire business called dirty work inc nthis should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy but for a film called dirtywork what ensues is rather clean of spirit nin fact what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine but rather a more sappy reason sams father jack warden needs a heart transplant and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list his compulsively betting doctor chevy chase asks the guys for 50 000 to pay off his bookie nso for all the scheming that goes on beneath every underhanded plot isgasp a nheart which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise nnot that there isnt a lot of nastiness on displaythere is but of a different sort nthere are frequent sexual references most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sams impotent fathers ongoing lust for them nand for a film rated pg13 director bob saget yes that bob saget of fullhouse and americasfunniesthomevideos fame and writers frank sebastiano fred wolf and macdonald himself stretch the boundaries of good taste rather fararguably a bit too much so was not one but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary nbut the issue of course is not so much of taste as it is humoras in is it funny or not nthe answer is a resounding no nits not that macdonald isnt a funny guy nhe was one of the more consistently funny performers on saturdaynightlive before his muchtalkedabout firing and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen it also doesnt hurt that hes a natural likable screen presence nhe is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch but for the most part the oneliners as written are flat and the broad slapstick gags just dont work one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildingsa real riot nstill macdonalds few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has nthe late chris farley as hysterical as he ever was is amusing in a cameo role but as a whole the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance nsaget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman adam sandler and john goodman but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent dirtywork from sputtering to the end of its brief 81minute running time nthe film closes on a sad note of desperation an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement ncome to think of it i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of dirtywork n
this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be one of the hottest writers in hollywood nhe wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream 810 then added the successful i know what you did last summer 7 510 nscript to his mix and also created the popular tv series dawsons creek nso when he asked to direct his first movie based on his first ever script written everyone and their grandma said sure go for it nuhhm my question is did anyone bother reading this stupid script nplot ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west mrs tingle and set to lose her scholarship to college nwhen she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story they end up tying her up and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman ncritique its not so much that this is a bad movie than the fact that it sucks nthis movie is chockfull of onedimensional characters contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on zero tension or thrills plot holes the size of my big ass lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie and molly ringwald vivica a fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles ni was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery 810 and 9 to 5 but unfortunately for williamson he went nowhere with the bright foundation making references to the exorcist and dr nzhivago which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate nhe also forgot about suspense with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue nsure katie holmes is cute and her costar marisa coughlan did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist worth two points out of my three on ten but how can we forgive the biggest onedimensional character in any film holmes rival in the film mrs tingles complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays and a transparent romance between holmes and some longhaired dude hired to be the poor mans version of skeet ulrich who himself is a poor mans version of johnny depp nall in all this movie was laughable for me provided me with no insight into anything demonstrated williamsons genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability humanity or capacity to comprehend nno hip lines no cheap thrills just a dull time at the movie theater nif you want to see a funny teenage movie go see detroit rock city 810 and thank my drunken sorry ass in the morning nlittle known facts about this film and its stars kevin williamsons father was a fisherman nkevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer 7 510 nhe is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally so is dawson leery on tvs dawsons creek a show kevin created nhe was once an aspiring actor nin fact he even landed a bit part on tvs another world nalso williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs tingle which is also loosely based on the book killing mr griffin by the writer of i know what you did last summer 7 510 nlois duncan nhe has also come out and said that he is a gay man nhelen mirren was born in london england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff nshe is married to director taylor hackford whose works include devils advocate 810 and an officer and a gentleman 8 510 nthis film was originally titled killing mrs ntingle but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident nactress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called wasteland nthis is actor barry watson first full feature film nhe has played the character of seth on tvs malibu shores several times n

the happy bastards quick movie review nthe concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid really nshift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control nsadly that is the case with kingpin a film directed by the farrelly brothers the duo that brought us theres something about mary and dumb and dumber nsince the duo directed and didnt write the script i can assume thats part of the problem nthe story seems good enough a pro bowler in the 1970s by the name of roy munson woody harrelson is sitting on top of the world nhis popularity has gone through the roof and hes getting his career off the ground nthen however he runs into ed mccracken bill murray a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for well anything nthese two form an illtimed relationship that involves risky betting and before roy sees it coming eds abandoned him and hes about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine nforward seventeen years later where roy has become quite the loser complete with mechanical hand tornup car and of course the occasional knocking up of the uglyass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while nhowever he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael randy quaid who has quite the bowling arm nwith the kids help he figures he can be known again particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno nevada nof course the amish kid needs some coaxing particularly when you consider well hes amish nthis leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film such as roys process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow nfinally the duo get on the road and along the way pick up an additional helper a beautiful hustler played by the gorgeous vanessa angel nthe main problem i had with kingpin wasnt the fact it wasnt funny nin fact it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it such as the aformentioned above and roys explanation of not having children something involving a cheese grater nbut thats just it scenes ntheres a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie like the abuse angel takes from her hustler exboyfriend ni mean was this really necessary ncouldnt have this been handled just a bit wackier ni mean this is a comedy why throw ethics in nparticularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle where hair gel can be easily mistaken nthat really ruined it however and thats too bad nthe acting is top notch especially from angel and murray and the really funny scenes are worth noting nstill if youre going to think dumb think dumb all the way through ok nat least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or id still be a little bit irked n
the generals daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film well see this year or perhaps the stupidest clever film nits confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction nthat however is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller nthe punchedup punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the generals daughter has a brain in its head even as the remaining 75 of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense nour hero is warrant officer paul brenner a brash investigator for the u s armys criminal investigation division nhis latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson at a georgia base the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation ncomplicating the case is the fact that capt campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell a war hero and potential vicepresidential nominee ngeneral campbell wants to keep the case out of the press which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in nteamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe who coincidentally enough once had a romantic relationship with brenner brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captains past that make the case ever more sordid nif only the sordidness were the worst of the generals daughters problems nscenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filteredlight sleaze ndirector simon west likely thinks hes covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches which is the films fatal flaw nits a trend he continues for two hours taking the storys few virtues and slapping a coat of moronproof obviousness over them ncharacters who may wink wink turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow cutaway inserts of the captain campbells stillliving face after the corpse is uncovered insure against fiveminute attention spans nwest just cant help himself from overdirecting every minute of the generals daughter nhe even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slowfade edits nbubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell nthe slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbells mentor a psychological warfare expert named moore james woods ntheres something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another nindeed travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures to the local sheriff of the georgia county shouldnt you be out nightsticking the colored folk neven the lame device of brenner and sunhills sexual history provides a few winning zingers ngoldmans dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than youll find in most socalled comedies ndialogue unfortunately just isnt enough to make a quality script nits difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene and too lucky for it to last any longer not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye nby the time the generals daughter wanders towards its overwrought psychointherain finale wests heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun nits silly and pretentious filmmaking but at least it provides a giggle or five ngoldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a standup routine n

so much for sweet returns nafter smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80s slasher movies starting with 1996s scream and followed by scream 2 urban legend and the original i know what you did last summer a film like i still know what you did last summer was bound to be made sooner or late nit is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out and that is because they reached for the lowestcommondenominator in filmmaking favoring nonstop deaths and gore for suspense and trading in fleshed out likable characters for onedimensional nitwits nit has been exactly one year since julie james jennifer love hewitt suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road and then thinking he was dead dumped him into the ocean nsince then julie has relocated to boston university and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams she has been able to put her life back together nwhen julies friend karla brandy is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people which also includes karlas horny boyfriend tyrell mekhi phifer and will matthew settle who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend ray freddie prinze jr also returning from the original doesnt show up nwhen they reach the secluded island they discover it is the last day of the open season and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them nof course julie her friends and the workers arent the only ones there as the murderous ben willis dressed in fisherman garb returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all nit is a sad state of affairs when a movie like i still know what you did last summer is made ni am a very big fan of horror movies and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to ikwydls which i am a fan of is almost an exact replica of a friday the 13th movie nwhile the original focused more on the story and characters as well as genuinely suspenseful moments thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson who didnt return to write the sequel and it shows i still know nhas no story to speak of and is so vacuous of ideas that the filmmakers were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested nalso gone are any signs of character development and since every single character died before i got to know them all i was left with was to stare at the screen indifferent to what was going on nwhile i cared about the fates of the characters in the original it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died nthey were all paperthin and pointless except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman nanother element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted setpieces like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar but there are none to speak of in this sequel although they do come close at one moment with brandy nsince so many people were killed every couple minutes the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water nalso of note is the mystery of the second killer and accomplice to ben but it is obvious from the first frame who it is and so i couldnt even have fun at that like i did in the scream movies and urban legend nit figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else nmaybe the people who made i still know what you did last summer should have realized that in order to make a good movie you must have a screenplayor at least one that isnt such a black hole for thoughts and ideas nthe ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead n
this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time na fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyones favorite goaliemaskwearing homicidal maniac njason the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area doesnt start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel nwhile he does have a small role in this film we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count nthe plot like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as hesheit possibly can in the space of a 90 minute movie nthe reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story nbut for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in a movie such as a plot here are the basics na bunch of unsuspecting teens get a summer job at a long closed summer camp nthey are days away from the arrival of the kids and they are spending their time fixing the place up and making sure it is ready for the kids nsadly they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer nat this point i would usually say something about the quality of acting directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production nsince im not going to do that feel free to assume that if i did it wouldnt be positive ni will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about a hundred bucks and that includes the actors salaries nif you are used to recent horror films like scream you are in for a bit of a surprise nthe only saving grace for friday the 13th is that it was really the first of its kind with the killer taking real pride in their work nusing as many methods of murder as they could nnone of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre or the creatively stifled imagination of halloweens michael myers who just used brute force or a really big kitchen knife nnope in the friday the 13th movies you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work none fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes a very young kevin bacon although after this movie it is a wonder he ever worked again nthe main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning nif not stick with the later films with jason everyones favorite hockey fan nfriday the 13th is the sort of movie that is fun to sit down and get a couple of scares from just dont sit down expecting a whole lot n
tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie nthe film which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage and while its evident that this could be a fascinating live production the translation to the screen is a creative disaster nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art lifeless and tedious nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium ntectonic plates has a storyline although the narrative is developed in a decidedly nontraditional fashion with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences nits not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious allbutscreaming look nart nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters nbecause were constantly made aware that were watching a play or a movie its impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writers ideas ntheyre not real sympathetic or believable nim willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different but this particular experiment is not a success ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine marie gignac an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor jacques lapage none day he disappears and fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love madeleine travels to venice to kill herself nwhile preparing to commit suicide she encounters drug addict constance celine bonnier who causes madeleine to rethink her decision nmeanwhile jacques has moved to new york city where he starts crossdressing calls himself jennifer and becomes a successful counterculture talkshow host nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deafmute and cultural references that point to chopin george sand and jim morrison tectonic plates is unique if nothing else nhowever as interesting as the film sounds and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising it never really delivers nthe tone is soporific the supposedlyintellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner although it doesnt take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant and the symbolism is obvious ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth but it takes onehundred minutes to get across this transparent point nthere are some worthwhile moments such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who arent bilingual nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because a its different b its not like anything theyve seen before and c its pretentious nfor everyone else its not only a waste of time but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage n

i still cant figure out why people went in droves to see this movie nnow before you go assuming im some sort of high brow snob who cant appreciate a little dumb humor let me say that i love cheap humor ni thought theres something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998 nlow brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent there is no humor component ni wanted to like the waterboy i really did ni think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie nactually i smiled a couple of more times on top of that nnot a great record for a 90minute film nthe problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies nthose responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material nnothing could be further from the truth as matter of fact sandlers idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film nits really a shame too because this film had the potential to be very funny ni personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian its just that so far he hasnt been able to find the right film to showcase his talents nif his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live nmost of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry nsandler plays a 31yearold somewhat mentally challenged waterboy for a college football team nthe teams somewhat mentally disturbed coach henry winkler realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pentup rage which if harnessed properly would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field nyou can figure out the rest from here nsandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star nas i said the film had a great deal of potential nthe idea was a decent one but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast nall of whom are very good just hamstrung by really really lousy material neven sandler annoying goofy voice and all has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material neven as unfunny as his character is i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film nbut it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about nif their material had been just a bit better this film could have been such a funny movie nfairuza balk plays sandlers leatherwearing bikerchick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time nwinkler is great as the coach who uses a coaching for dummies style book to help him get through games nthe real standout though is kathy bates neven with some of the worst material of her career to deal with she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandlers overprotective and overbearing mama neven with the performances of bates and winkler there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie nalthough i get the distinct impression that without them this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me nwhich is sad because i cant really put my finger on a particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became nits obvious that those involved specifically the actors tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be a funny movie nits just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat n
mr bean a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting nthe first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during beans trip to la but if they didnt look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride nheck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick neither way look out america bean is coming nwell what can really be said about this movie there is very little discernible plot nthat much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy nit achieves that goal rather admirably but because it is that the plot is just screaming for help nthe whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed nthe movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes adlibbed as you went ndont go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece nbut if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie even if you dont like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because somethings are just so stupid nthe movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims or so it seems nnow when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner nwell there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasnt the easiest i am sure ni have to concede that mr atkinsons acting in this movie is well done nalthough the role isnt too demanding the slapstick is ni think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie nnow the rest of the actors in the movie bad acting and poor casting ni think that the role opposite bean could have been better just seemed wrong for the movie na different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasnt what was trying to be achieved none thing that i must say simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results ntv shows should do just that stay on tv it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers ni can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively the best known of those would have to be star trek nbean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved nnow another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly nthe form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless nbut if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie nbut to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie nthere are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one n
in 1989 director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama glory but since then he has made continuous disappointments to me at least with 1994s legends of the fall and 1996s courage under fire nthose two films werent bad just not very good but with zwicks latest film the siege he has finally made one n the siege is a modernday actionthriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city ninvestigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard denzel washington and frank haddad tony shalhoub who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it nlater a bomb goes off in a broadway theater killing even more nthey soon meet cia operative elise kraft annette bening who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist nthere are some movies that simply dont need to be made and the siege may very well be one of them noh sure zwick thinks he is making a meaningful action film since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than say die hard which also starred bruce willis nthis time willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u s army who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax nwhatever points the siege earnestly tried to make were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen or maybe zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place nthe role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical just as women were in the recent john caprenters vampires by placing them all in the category of bad guys n the siege contains three fine actorswashington bening and shalhoubbut washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development nbening has slightly more to do and has an intriguing character to work with while shalhoub pretty much steals the show even though again he has no real character nby the climax of the siege with washington giving a sermon to willis on the socalled message of the story i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to on deadly ground in which steven seagal gave a 10minute speech at the end about preserving the environment n the siege is constantly heavyhanded not entertaining or insightful and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay n

an american werewolf in london is john landis groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england nthe groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects nmore specifically the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf and for the ghosts that haunt the main character neven twenty years after its release that part of the movie is still impressive nalthough i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive nthe rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure nif it werent for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 nand with good reason the acting isnt great and neither is the writing nwell ok we dont actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film nbut one other important element is lacking here too it isnt scary nwith no exception you know what is going to happen before it happens nyou dont even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint ni will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen nbut john it just wasnt scary ni didnt know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it but it didnt work for me nactually it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films nbut the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad the intended humor was lost on me nits never a good sign that you dont realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material ncall me crazy but you shouldnt have to do research on a movie to enjoy it nim not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up nwerewolf bites boy david naughton nboy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse jenny agutter and then strange things begin to happen to boy nincluding and i must admit this is a very nice touch visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital nthe neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse ni know it sounds strange but it actually works nthe scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy griffin dunne are really the best parts of the movie nas i said probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects nwhile they are still impressive today they arent impressive enough or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film nand since they are more or less the highlight of the film there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch nactually the 1998 sequel an american werewolf in paris is more entertaining since it doesnt take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way n
i think maybe its time for the batman series to be put to rest nnot only has the first two films unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a superhero been abandoned but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for allout camp with few traces of the selfmocking restraint of the relatively lighthearted third installment nlet me give you an example in the first scene of the movie batman george clooney and robin chris odonnell are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger in an attempt to steal a diamond nmr freezes thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks but this is no problem for our heroes automatic skates shoot out of their shoes at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick grabs the diamond and stickhandles it through the museum ni might have expected this from an airplanestyle farce but i dont think thats what this movie is supposed to be nafter all the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superheroaction genre and kept the corny deathdefying stunts to a minimum while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony nnot any more the list goes on and on in this one nrobin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 000 feet high in the atmosphere climbing in the door to save batman nmr freeze and poison ivy uma thurman leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond na world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old heman cartoons nmy very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl alicia silverstone gets in a race with motorcycle thugs during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her nnot bad but wouldnt the police or maybe batman nnotice if the road was on fire ni knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place but n n n nit also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment nas if three protagonists and two villains werent enough batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce waynes butler alfred michael gough which might have seemed poignant if it wasnt surrounded by so much silliness as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruces girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie nall this might be semiexcusable if the story were interesting and entertaining but it isnt nin fact its kind of boring nmr freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholsons joker and danny devitos penguin ntheir evil plot is as predictable schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words today gotham city tomorrow the world nas it is lamebrained didnt it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too nand robins constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bullheaded and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place nstrip away the stars the fancy set design and the status as a batman movie and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick n
traffic violation dr daniels review of uturn ndr ds rating critical condition nokay heres the deal nill be the first one to grant that everybody needs a day off now and then nill even go so far as to say that a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well ni mean hey ive been known to stretch a weekend into a threeday outing if friday looks to be a slow day nand if monday aint looking like a pickmeup well ive been known to give martha nell a call and say do me a favor sweetheart nbump old man fergusons boil lancing to tuesday morning and tell miss audrey that ill swing by her house monday evening and see if we cant get her trick knee back in line na simple sentence like that and ive got a nice fourday fishing trip with the boys or more often than not a trip up to cherokee n c for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery nbut the point is if you take a day off do something different nif youve worked yourself silly for months relax a bit nsleep in neat pancakes at noon nmicrowave an egg in its shell nwatch pro wrestling with the sound off nlisten to some barry white records at high speed nwhatever nbut do not under any circumstances spend your vacation doing the same thing you do for a living nand if you do dont make the final product look ten times worse than it would any other time nbecause i do not want to hear your sob stories oliver stone nyou apparently thought you needed a break from making important films ncool nso you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie nthats cool too nbut ollie old sage do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade nim just eager to meet you one day so i can buy you a stoli look you in the eye and say what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with uturn nand ill stand there staring til i get a straight answer nsean penn stars uturn as bobby a drifter whos had some troubles a while back nhes heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose stranding him in superior arizona held there by an ignorant inbred turtleneck hick of a mechanic named darrell nwhile darrell puts a new hose on the ride bobby walks into town to see whats cooking nis it needless of me to say that superior arizona is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely nprobably not nbobby meets up with grace jennifer lopez who invites him back to her place for drapehanging and other domestic issues njust as those issues are starting up graces husband jake storms in looking like checkout day of the elks lodge convention njust beats bobby silly nbobby takes to the road only to meet up with jake again and jake asks bobby to kill grace na little while later grace asks bobby to kill jake nthem murderous arizonians ngotta love em nif any of this sounds familiar congratulations nyou win a kewpie doll nthe story is a straight shoplift of red rock west a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl maker of the phenomenal the last seduction nbut the contest doesnt end there guys and gals nwe get steals from russ meyer movies where everybody in town is horny and sweaty nwe get the town from bad day at black rock minus the train plus busty women who can speak nlook at any schwarzenegger film and youll see our hero bobby as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times gets bit by a tarantula gets shot at and ends up with vultures circling overhead all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick nbobby as terminator nstretch it a bit and we have a fivefinger discount from doc hollywood where the whole story occurs because of car trouble forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic nokay hes working from a book so maybe ollies not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas ni just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative ni just wish he hadnt brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toestub nsean penn gives a great performance and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be playing overthetop caricatures of stereotype characters nthe best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blanketyblank is going on ntoo bad its not fun to watch when its happening to us while nwe sit through this mess of a film nuturn is not a bad film if youre a fan of technique nits the oliver stone youve always known nrobert richardson is his usual cinematographer and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick great camera angles shifting viewpoints wicked colors nice looking pictures nbut pictures of what ni think id rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tiltowhirl point of this loser film nplot twists are one thing repetition is almost unforgivable and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie ive seen in the past five years noliver i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at nyouve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie and films like platoon jfk wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on nyour scripts are certainly respectable your budgets are up there on the screen and your actors dont dog it nand i know that maybe with uturn you were just kicking back just having fun nthats fine nbut dont do that with a movie with the potential of this one ndo some police academy sequel imagine that ndo a big comedy like a remake of its a mad mad mad mad world nbut do not drop a limp uturn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as an oliver stone movie and not question why it stinks like weekold snook ntheres a right way to have fun and a wrong way to have fun nthis was as wrong as you can get without going to jail n
fantastically over hyped godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen nthe film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands then an attack on a boat from some beast and finally we join dr nick tatopoulos broderick looking about 17 years old doing some research in chernobyl nsome shady u s government guys appear and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints from what looks like a giant lizard nand whats more this beast is heading for new york ngulp nalthough godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride and at some points it is there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie nthe main faults lie with the acting and writing common problems with summer blockbuster movies nbroderick is pretty useless as the hero with no humour or a tough guy image nwhile emmerichs previous summer flick independence day 1996 had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith this has neither nalso maria pitillo as brodericks former girlfriend is just as useless with a chronic disability in acting nshes incapable of showing emotion speaks every line in the same way and basically shes total crap nits up to french actor jean reno to save the day and indeed he does turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent nshame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film nhank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named animal and he adds a little life to the picture nalso making an appearance is harry shearer probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons as a slimy news reporter no k so the acting is not up to par but it never is in these movies nbut what about the script nwell thats not up to par either nemmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script nthe dialogue is banal broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters thats a lot of fish and the character development is non existent reno plays the typical frenchman no croissant nbroderick forever remains a geeky scientist nalso the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour nthe jokes that are uttered are pathetic and theres an hilarious running gag about siskel and ebert n the mayor is mayor ebert and is assistant is called gene nha ha ha ha nthe plot is dire and in the end just rips off jurassic park 1993 by having lots of baby godzillas i e nvelicorapters running around new york nright so the script and acting suck nbut what about the special effects nthankfully theyre are quite good ngodzilla is an impressive piece of cgi although we dont see much of him because the movie is so dark nthe destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell nbut although they are impressive they cant save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie nthe movie goes on for far too long aswell and it cant seem to decide on a ending nand of course the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel nlets just hope one never arrives n
starship troopers is a bad movie ni mean a really really bad movie nnot only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood gore and body parts shown on the screen it blissfully jumps over that line apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds of which i saw many in the theatre nlooking past the appalling sight of overdone violence we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best no strong lead characters a blatant disregard for physics and a very obvious naziesque theme nthat being said onto the review the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation whos logo bears a strong resemblance to a nazi german eagle urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs who are attempting to destroy earth nthe film shows large rallies with young children in attendance pledging allegiance to the federation again sound familiar nas the movie progresses we are shown terror tactic training as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm and throws a knife through anothers hand neventually the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy to fight the bugs on their home planet nas our faster than light travelling heroes arrive on planet they drop onto the planet and burst our of their craft brandishing n what nyou say laser beam weapons nsonic weapons nphasers nphoton cannons nnope they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns pump action rifles and tactical nuclear weapons ni guess a lot of physics money rd went into travel and not weaponry nas the assault begins our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon ntwo members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them and one even sees a streak fly by but disregards it as nothing nthis of course leads to more massive carnage blood shed and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies nagain i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons nin the end we see neil patrick doogie howser harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat hat and gloves nhe does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug and then proclaims that the bugs are scared nthis sets the troopers into a frenzy as they are now one step closer to completing their goal total genocide of a species again sound familiar ni have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review but given its nonexistence i may have anyway ni could go on for pages ripping this movie apart but dont want to bore you too badly nin short i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pronazi war film with bugs substituted for allies a drivers education accident scene film and a complete blank screen the plot of course ni wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone anywhere under any circumstance ncopyright c 1997 tim jandt n
the last line or near to that honor is the great butler alfred the ubergod michael gough saying i think we need a bigger bat cave or something to that note nthats exactly what this film is too big for its own good because it has too damn much ncut batgirl out ncut one of the villains nits too much to handle in one dosage nits so much that characters get left behind npoor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way shape or form nand elle deserves better nthis is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher nits also the fourth worst in the series and second worst from joel nthe series has been declining since its stunning debut followed by the almostasstunning sequel and then the anticlimactic third one first by joel nthis ones not anticlimactic i knew it was gonna suck nits up to joel to make it fun though n batman forever was fun nthis is a big bore of overproduced action sequences and shallow characters ni mean this one bit nim gonna put all the plot in one paragraph mr freeze ahnold whos wife was dying of some disease has become the new big villain these days nhes a huge exscientist who fell into some weird liquid hello njoker and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body nbatman george and robin chris fight him a bit but find theyre growing apart nmeanwhile another villain shows up poison ivy uma who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist john glover who kills her when she finds out hes used her research to develop an uberman bane who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had nshe emerges from her chemicals dont ask cause i cant tell ya as a sexy woman the real uma whos poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people nshe starts to tear away at the dynamic duo nmeanwhile alfreds dying of the same disease mr freezes wife has but in an earlier state than she and his niece barbara alicia comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade but soon well not really soon it takes her 2 hours becomes batgirl nmeanwhile in an unfinished subplot bruce batmans alterego if you forgot has been dating the lovely julie madison the even lovlier elle macpherson who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing nend of her for all we know nmr freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population dont ask nthe trio must team together as family to beat them nthere ya go nnot the whole story but no big context clues ntoo much right nright nthe films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels nhowever while tim burton nicely balanced the villainbatman storyline although not wonderfully joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one nhe gets some corny speeches a couple clever lines and thats it nmaybe some stunts nfor all this i cant even comment on george clooney as batman i hardly saw the guy nand when i did he had horrible dialogue to say ni think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode ngeorge is in between them nhes not quintessential hes not horrible hes good nbut im sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since theyll be critically murdered for this sorry effort well get a good script and clooney will shine if he still has the job nthe villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher nlast time we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brainscomedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey nthis time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain the same guy mr freeze nwe feel bad for his mentalphysical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants narnold isnt very good too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points nwhen he watches old movies of his wife he actually looks somber nwow nbut uma makes the most of her seductive character getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness nits like shes almost parodying herself in pulp fiction at points nshes incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better nas for the lower batpeople chris is the same as he was in batman forever although i think his work in these is too hokey when hes best at quieter parts in scent of a woman or just plain cool parts in fried green tomotoes nalicia i love the girl but shes not particularly good in this film nshe can hypotheitically act we all saw that in clueless but her lines kinda sound weird nand it isnt the mushymouth this time nbut in all fairness she has virtually no part njoel gets around to her occasionally and when shes on she does stupid stuff although ni know im not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma nand poor elle npoor poor elle ni love that woman and she can also hypothetically act for those of us who saw sirens nbut she has no part nit seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product nthere are no couch scenes like my best friend noticed nnow listen to me on this one in every batman flick theres a couch scene nin the original it was with vicki nin returns it was a good makeout scene with selena nand in the last one it was a chat with nicole nthis one its nothing nand batgirl does nexttonothing in this film till the end when shes suddenly part of the family nfortunately we get a lot of alfred nhes the always reliable butler in case you didnt know who has been with bruce all his life nhes a god nhes a father figure nhes also dying nthis got to me ni love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe not in his tux and freaking dying just gets to me nwe also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time but nthis is never answered as this film is too cluttered nbut in defense it does have some good parts other than uma nfor one george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do nand there are some nice touches nwhen they show the asylum at one point they show the patients belongings in a room and we see the riddlers costume ni laughed nand during a biker scene involving robin and batgirl another subplot never handled past initiation period we not only see coolio but a bunch of badasses dressed as droogs from a clockwork orange ni laughed at all these nthe film falls apart around the fiveminute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes or ndid it just feel like that nthe film should serve as another in the longline of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays npeople are fed up with stupid films nthats why the word of mouth killed the lost world nthats why last year indy films grossed more than ever nthats why this will have a strong boxoffice initative from people who just want to see it like me but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it nthats why the next two bigbudget aciton pics are john woos faceoff and barry sonnenfelds men in black both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on ni like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste ni like some of his films flatliners a time to kill but a lot of them suck nhes a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and thats what makes him great nbut his costuming for woody allens sleeper was more interesting than this one and his costuming was cool look for the nazi number ni love the batman series nthe first two rocked and i did like the last one nbut this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three nhopefully this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time nand maybe theyll get smart and bring back catwoman nand michael keaton nbut we can only hope n
barb wire pamela anderson lees first foray into films highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets nbeing the only notable member of the cast the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity making her characters catch line dont call me babe sound very ironic indeed nfrom the very opening of the movie we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe nthroughout the movie there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage if not of andersons then at least of the female extras nthis alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire nfor a plot barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline nit is 2017 the middle of the second american civil war and barb wire a former resistance fighter runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead nknown for attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazistyle uniforms nin between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts barb wire has to help a former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town past the governmentcontrolled areas and to freedom neven the airport looks like the one in casablanca except that the plane in the background is a modern private jet nthere are hardly any significant moments in this film and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of barb wire nif anything one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di d not do her own stunts nwho could fight and jump in a skimpy strapless leather top and yet keep her breasts from spilling out nonly a stuntwoman nnot pamela anderson lee n
way of the gun is brimming with surprises some good most bad none of the good ones is ryan phillippes surprisingly halfway decent performance nafter the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer he hinted at a bit growth in last years cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans and start bellyaching about how hed fallen for his target nit was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the films director could negotiate nbut he seems to be trying and that shouldnt be overlooked or probably over praised seeing as how at this point he really isnt required to do much but look pretty nhere phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his look here see glory nits tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass but his performance actually helps with the illusion nunlike ben afflecks puppy dog approach in reindeer games phillippe is believable and not too bad at that nas for the plot well thats one of the bad surprises phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic and not even remotely likeable criminals introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother juliette lewis after overhearing that shes carrying the baby of painter scott wilson a very well connected wealthy man nthe kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed nbut the antiheroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man james caan and two scheming bodyguards taye diggs and nicky katt remain in pursuit ndirected by christopher mcquarrie the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles this one included way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity nunlike phillipe mcquarrie doesnt seem to be growing at all he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know ive seen before and worse it feels like it nthe film lacks even a fresh approach like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey to its clich s all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is nit features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life neven attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life philosophy etc i didnt like the bit much when it first appeared in heat here its even more self consciously dramatic nusual suspects which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending nnowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential nthus nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret most amateurishly projected before they appear and it too has an ironic little twist at the end nothing earth shattering like in the usual suspects but i admit i didnt see it coming and i smiled nhowever most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason nor substance nits just as overplotted as suspects and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters a distinctive style or a good script would be neven the good stuff most of which involves james caan doing a fine job feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like karma is only justice with out the satisfaction are clever nat one point caan laments need is the ultimate monkey a line so inexplicable he might as well have said love is like hippo ass nive seen porno with better dialogue nand some with better plot lines too nbut rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast i mean can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy ncaan slips into this role with seeming ease he could do this kind of softspoken tough guy in a coma but he manages to give his character depth and weariness nbenicio del torro is always welcome though here he plays it fairly straight rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage adopting a brad pittesque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering nspeaking of pitt his ex juliette lewis is a weak link either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness or waddling about like a silly goose nnicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted hes only kept around for his cold presence ntaye diggs has a similar function cool as ever but never a character though the guy has one helluva death scene nfor the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippos ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns nits vaguely tarantinoish but in a bad truth and consequences nm way with phillippe in one scene leaping into a stupid rant about faggots migrating to los angeles nyou know the routine nthe final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at nbut those gun shots sure crack like thunder njust the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant gruntlike sound that emanated from harrys fetishized smith and wesson noh how far weve

after the recent animated debacles of a rugrats movie and a bugs life i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks other insect film from october antz ni hated that movie and yet it is so much better than these latest two excursions n a bugs life is the second animated insect film in the last two months and i hoped for the best considering it was done in the wonderful style of pixars last film 1995s toy story but in no way does a bugs life even remotely match up to that nflik david foley an ant who along with his many comrades has the job every year of gathering up the seasonal harvest only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey nflik however feels all alone and unwanted in the world especially after he accidentally loses all of their food and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other seasons load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees nbanished from ant island flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out but through a misunderstanding returns with a handful of helpless circus bugs including a walking stick david hyde pierce a dung beetle brad garrett a gypsy moth madeline kahn a male ladybug denis leary and a caterpillar joe ranft n a bugs life has one thing going for it nonly one thing nwith its glorious bright colors the computergenerated animation is a spectacle to look at nthe film itself unfortunately is a lifeless unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitement of toy story nthe characters in a bugs life are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality other than to stand around and recite arbitrary and thoroughly unfunny oneliners nthe thin story was also stretched out to a nearly unbearable 94 minutes and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as timefiller nafter giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year i was beginning to think that i had simply outgrown them but then i realized this is just not so ni still adore almost all of the older disney films and many of the newer ones such as 1989s the little mermaid 1991s beauty and the beast 1993s the nightmare before christmas and yes 1995s toy story nmaybe this has just been a bad year for childrens films and hopefully the upcoming the prince of egypt will not be a disappointment nas for a bugs life i did not enjoy anything about it nnot the story not the characters and not even the voiceover work which was far more lively in antz n a bugs life goes down as yet another failure for disney and it is a sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture ill be home for christmas n
at the outset of swordfish john travoltas gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today nbasically he says it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers nhow ironic as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture nswordfish is loud violent and amoral nit has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life nand how does travoltas gabriel plan to do this nby robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to outterrorize terrorists nswordfish is a very cynical movie nit relies on an audiences perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as nonhuman faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration nthe movies plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down youd actually see how ridiculous it all is nthis is a liveaction road runner cartoon moving so quickly that its over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions nthe storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson hugh jackman recruited by gabriel to crack the governments computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his antiterrorist campaign ntalk about whackedout patriotism nmy objections to swordfish are many nthe body count is high but that is expected in a movie of this sort nits becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers police officers and government agents blown to bits nanother example is the family dynamics between stanley his 10yearold daughter and his exwife nstanley though having served time in prison for hacking is shown as a loving and caring father forbidden by his ex to see his little girl naudience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husbands adult films nthus when she is found murdered late in the movie neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve nin fact subconsciously many in the audience are probably glad she was killed nthen there is the sequence involving one of gabriels henchman holding a gun to the head of stanleys daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel nchildren as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich in recent films nthere is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them onscreen victims as well nyea its only make believe but that doesnt mean you have to tolerate it ntravolta is cool deadly charming and flamboyant as the nearcrazy gabriel nhis character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and faceoff njackman looks dour through most of the proceedings nhis only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database nhis sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate nhalle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriels assistant while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel nswordfish plays like a comic book with a largerthanlife character in gabriel nviewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain nand maybe that is the movies underlying flaw there is no real hero to speak of only those doing their upmost to survive nand that is not enough nthis is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water n
young einstein is embarrassingly lame but that didnt stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia where it became the third largest box office hit of all time nin the u s warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan inxs and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under npersonally im hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb nyoung einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious who not only wrote produced edited and directed the film but also starred and did his own stunts nhis creation is about as stupid and contrived as youd expect from someone named yahoo nthe movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einsteins youth nwhereas the scientist actually hailed from germany the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania a remote australian island nin addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity albert invents surfing bubbles in beer and the electric guitar nyahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hicka clown with an insatiable curiosity nalthough yahoos performance is at first endearing the onedimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say emc2 nyahoo has created a charming family for albert and the scenes on tasmania are often clever nbut after the first twenty minutes the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy nyoung einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot nyahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack unfortunately the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing nalmost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video nthe instrumental score on the other hand is generally playful yahoo uses such classics as the 1812 overture and the theme from the good the bad and the ugly to great comic effect nhalfway through young einstein i knew for sure the movie was a stinker nbut it wasnt until the very end that i finally put my finger on why the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies such as young sherlock holmes but from cheesy primetime sitcoms nin fact young einstein might have been more at home on network television where its sophomoric humor wouldnt raise any eyebrows n
robin williams this time without a beard returns to drama in this sloppy sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects nhe plays chris nielsen who meets annie annabella sciora and promptly marries her nthey have two great kids who sadly die in a car crash njust when it couldnt get any worse chris gets killed in a car crash and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert gooding jnr nannie cant take the grief anymore and kills herself n all sounding like good fun so far nthe penalty for suicide is to go to hell and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller max von sydow nbased on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson what dreams may come is clunky manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar nthis is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made neverything is wrong about this movie the performances are forced and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters nwilliams puts on a convincing upset face but thats all it is a face ntheres no emotion behind it nscioras performance is lazy and bogs down the whole film nshe may look pretty but she cant act nmax von sydow is o k as the traveller if nothing special ncuba gooding jnr thankfully adds some bounce to his performance and is certainly the best performer in the film nits a shame that his character is so flat and 2d and offers no room for improvement nall the performers have to work with a soppy script that tries its best to get some emotion going but never takes off the ground nthere are some scenes which could be real heartwarmers but the faceless characters dont help to get anything out of the performers nwhile films like e t used great actors music and direction to pull of a masterful hearttugging scene what dreams may come is haphazard expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically ninstead its all rather boring nsure the music is pretty by michael kamen and the cinematography isnt bad by eduardo serra but theres something lacking nthe script doesnt help filled with hopeless romantic clich s and dud speeches nrichard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories sadly this novel would look embarrassed in a bargain bin let alone being converted into a 70 million vehicle for robin williams ndespite being set in heaven what dreams may come is mightily depressing nthe film rushes a happy ending but everything before this is very very sad and black which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid nbut theres one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie the special effects nheaven and hell are truly incredible places and the actors fit perfectly with the virtual sets nbut despite this what dreams may come proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of 1998 ninstead of raising questions about existence it raises boredom nsadly i recommend you give this film a miss nbetter luck next time robin na david wilcock review 1998 n you know for kids norville barnes n
mr nice guy is the latest jackie chan film so you should know what to expect na weak plot terrible dialogue very little acting ability but some jawdropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile nhowever mr nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackies best efforts and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever njackie chan plays who else jackie nthis time out hes a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show nnot that it ever makes a difference in the plot nthere are only two scenes of him cooking nfor the rest of the film somehow he mutates into jackie chan supercop nit never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege na tv newswoman diana gabrielle fitzpatrick covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo richard norton and a local gang of toughs the demons nalthough she only has one camcorder somehow the result is full of closeups and multiple angles hmmm nshades of broadcast news nanyway the goons discover diana and will do anything to recover the tape nhere lies another crucial flaw in the story doesnt anyone realize you can copy a tape noh well no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense nas luck would have it diana runs across jackie and wouldnt you know it jackie accidentally ends up with the tape nthis leads to countless chase andor fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie nin a move apparently designed to woo american and other englishspeaking audiences the film uses english as its primary language nhowever that doesnt mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackies recent americanized releases nstrangely many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english and poorly too nwhether this is just a very bad case of looping an effort to minimize accents or a simple case of nostalgia it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackies dubbed films nthe plot in mr nice guy is negligible merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons nbut even though plots have always been second to the action in jackies films it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread nlook if you have jackie chan playing a chef why not use that to your advantage nwatching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts nthe action is a mixed bag here ntheres really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackies films nit takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan nthe action in the film is neither jackies best nor worst but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes nthe films gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting nonce or twice it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence nbut to slomo jackie running neither this is a nod to the sixmillion dollar man or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down nif youve seen all of jackies films and are in need of another fix go ahead and see mr nice guy nhowever if youre just in the mood for some good action youd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work such as supercop n
one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek the star of the wbs runaway hit dawsons creek nfollowing in the foot steps of mtvs two other live action films joes apartment 1996 and dead man on campus 1998 varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace nset in west cannan texas the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john mox moxon van der beek nwe know hes smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook ncoach bud kilmer jon voight has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him nthe star quarterback lance harbor paul walker is a handsome blonde hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader darcy ali larter nalso on the team are an enormous guy ron lester with some health problems and the token africanamerican team member eliel swinton whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin nwhen lance is seriously injured mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies nhis relationship with his dutiful girlfriend jules amy smart is threatened and theres a big game at the end nguess who wins nnothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love ntheres a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow nvan der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes nalso the role isnt very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character nhes still a pseudointellectual whiny nice guy except here he also happens to be a jock nvoight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out nthe other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers dont fare much better non the positive side walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville 1998 nscott son of james caan has some lively moments as tweeder the teams wild man nlarter as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas gets to show off the films most interesting costumes including a very eyeopening whipped cream bikini nits interesting to note that the film definitely earns its rrating with a lot of harsh language alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise nall this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawsons creek presumably the target audience for the picture ndirector brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger from nickelodeon films a sister company of mtv and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression nthe look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it nthe football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out ntheres an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul foo fighters green day and aaliyah but its not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film n
tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy nrobbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss nhe goes into depression and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual ghetto side of every american city nthere lawernce attempts to steal his car but to no avail and is dragged along with robbins on a trip to arizona nthere they hold up a store are mistaken for two other robbers just like in my cousin vinny and are chased by the police and the other robbers nof course theres gags along the way usually from lawernce nalthough the film is midly funny and quite watchable theres something so horribly familiar about it all nthis film should really be called beverly hills midnight run theres lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop and pratically the same idea as midnight run nits full of all the road movie cliches and even has a comedy car chase which just seemed so eighties neven the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin or chevy chase eighties comedy nthere also isnt much chemistry between robbins and lawernce nin planes trains and automobiles there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy nin nothing to lose there is hardly chemistry at all ntowards the end the chemistry seems to work but for the bulk of the film there is hardly any nthe director directs the film in a workman like fashion but gets the jokes across nand although there is no chemistry between the two leads they give good performances on their own nlawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance and robbins is alright aswell nhowever robbins performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacobs ladder and the player nin fact if you want to see robbins do comedy much better than in nothing to lose i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy where he is much funnier nnothing to lose does have some funny moments in it however nthe humour isnt particulary sophisticated but if you enojyed dumb dumber you might enjoy this nthe characters in arizona are funny and theres also a good scene where robbins asks a shopkeeper which threatening approach was better lawerences which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeepers ass and swearing a lot or himselfs which was speaking in a deep scary voice but the gags are predictable the lack of chemistry infurating and the ending too farfetched and perfect nnothing to lose then is robbins first bad movie and hopefully his last and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film nhe nearly ruined carreys career with ace ventura when nature calls lets hope he hasnt ruined robbins or even lawerences with nothing to lose n

for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality trois is surprisingly tame ndespite its lurid subject matter and its passing nod to fatal attraction it moves along with flat uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film nfreshly moved to atlanta jermaine dourdan and his wife jasmine moore have the trappings of a perfect life nthey have a beautiful house in suburbia njermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm njasmine is his supportive wife who is finishing up her college degree nin an opening montage via a home video of the pair we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs nthis is a couple that has it all ninto this eden slithers the lure of lust ndespite his outward appearance jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person na glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business oblivious to jasmines concerns nwe also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage atrois much to jasmines dismay nas jermaine puts it dont you want to be sexually free njermaine shares his desire with coworker terrence smith who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter nthe woman jade palmer is a direct counterpoint to jasmine njade at one point was a college student too nunlike jasmine she found herself pregnant dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet nto further reinforce their differences its revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son ninevitably through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaines part the forbidden act is consummated nthe aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaines property with the hint that the violence may escalate nby this point trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama a fatal attraction without the social significance nthe exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical njermaine comes off as insincere sexually driven and selfish njasmine is bland and subservient njade comes off a bit sympathetically but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy nyet another tale of a sexually aggressive dog of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating innocent mate nthe last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve but by this point will you even care nif the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending perhaps there could have been some freshness to it nas it stands trois is pretty standard fare n

an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis 1981 feature an american werewolf in london nwhere the original had comedy the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sitcoms nwhere the first installment had chills this one has sequences that are inappropriately unintentionally funny nin short while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity nthe film opens with a trio of daredevil americans andy tom everett scott brad vince vieluf and chris phil buckman sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping nsoon they have company in the person of serafine julie delpy who has decided to end it all nshe jumps but andy with a bungee cord attached goes after her and manages to save her at the price of a major headache nserafine disappears but a smitten andy seeks her out nhowever once he learns his wouldbe girlfriends dark secret he wishes he hadnt nshes a werewolf cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full and to make matters worse he has suffered a nasty bite himself nactress julie delpy is far too good for this movie nshe imbues serafine with spirit spunk and humanity which gives us an emotional stake in the characters fate nthis isnt necessarily a good thing since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless campy entertainment experience ndelpys injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her ndelpys previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowskis white and richard linklaters before sunrise nshe was radiant charismatic and effective in both ngiven the nature and level of the material she has to work with here she gets as close as possible to those adjectives nit could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss nand if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts nthe rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy which is to say they give performances appropriate for the screenplay ntom everett scott that thing you do plays the lead like hes in a madefortv movie nit would be kind to call him bland nactors vince vieluf and phil buckman as andys friends are no more impressive njulie bowen happy gilmore is suitably fetching as werewolf meat nand respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal non the technical side its all bad news nthe computergenerated werewolves look painfully unreal nthe creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits nrepeated use is made of the werewolf cam an infrared wolfs pointofview approach thats interesting the first couple of times its employed then becomes tedious nand the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the onscreen action theyre matched to ndirector anthony waller who displayed a confident edgy style in mute witness stumbles with this material never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel nas a result we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii your sister is a werewolf n i will give waller credit for killing off a dog though something thats rarely seen in movies these days an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a bad movie sort of way but thats a dubious distinction nultimately its an unfortunate effort for while it isnt unbearable to sit through it isnt a howl either n
one of the most blatantly obvious signs that oftenacclaimed director sidney lumets gloria a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre nsuddenly i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in nwhen a movie is over arent we supposed to think about it for a while and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ni thought so but for one i saw this particular picture by myself and 2 even if i had been with someone there wouldnt have been anything to talk about in the first place nto be sure gloria begins with a stirring rather poignant prologue in which a sevenyearold boys family is brutally gunned down by mobsters in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it nright before the men broke in of course his father gave him the disc to escape with neventually the boy named nicky nunez jeanluke figueroa is caught by the mobsters and taken back to their apartment nmeanwhile gloria sharon stone has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didnt commit and returns to her exboyfriend jeremy northam to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime nwhen he refuses to give it to her and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky she leaves with him in order to save his life but not before holding the men at gunpoint stealing all of their money and forcing them to strip nude ngloria is the type of fasttalking smartmouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people and she never expected to be stuck with a kid but she has a heart of gold dont they always in this type of movie and is only trying to protect the boy whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with nthe previous incarnation of gloria by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands remains unseen by me but was no doubt superior even though i cant really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one regardless of the director or stars nthere is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original but the film itself is simply lifeless with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isnt completely unbearable to watch ni liked for example a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at and keeps turning the car around then driving a little ways then slamming on the brakes and turning around again nthese bright moments however appear long and far between and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria which is both painfully predictable and bythenumbers nthroughout my mind was repeatedly asking the question who really cares nas gloria sharon stone has adopted an overthetop brooklyn accent that honestly doesnt sound realistic at all nin the beginning in fact i was amazed at how amateurish stones performance was but as the film progressed she got better nalthough not one of her better turns stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored njeanluke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag nall other actors who appeared were considerably wasted none more than cathy moriarty an entertaining actress in her own right who is billed fourth and has all of one scene as glorias friend whom she turns to for help nsony the studio that released gloria obviously does not have any faith in the film and i dont blame them nthey declined to screen the picture for critics which is never a good sign particularly with the highprofile people involved nalthough how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is just look at the spectacular in dreams which failed to even make the top 10 last week i have a suspicion gloria is going to vanish from theaters faster than ishtar judging from the opening night 7 00 p m showing i saw it at where there were about ten to fifteen people present counting myself nalthough stone can be an impressive actress just watch her in 1995s casino or 1996s last dance if you dont believe me and sidney lumet can be a respectable director there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of gloria was worth remaking or for that matter why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful n
the great actor james woods once said and im paraphrasing if sex isnt messy then youre not doing it right na truly profound statement and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre just replace sex with your mad slasher film nfor those uninformed souls the mad slasher genre or subgenre is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween nurban legend is a mad slasher flick but one that is so sanitary bloodless and nudity free that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful though not overly talented cast it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special nfor film makers gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale frightfree horror movie as stephen king once said again paraphrasing if you cant scare your audience gross em out if you cant do that make em laugh nalas urban legend succeeds only at the latter though not by intention ni actually find the fact that this film became a minor success 40 million domestic box office gross more frightening than anything in it nit seems that audiences tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt nthe promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them nunfortunately these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations one idiotic superhyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films dont need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering nif anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin wild wild west and godzilla nbut forget all that it goes without saying that mad slasher films or any other exploitation offshoot will be made without an ounce of craft especially considering the sheer volume that are produced nallow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film the lack of enthusiastic exploitation nthese flicks arent harnessed with any lofty aspirations so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time nsadly out of the literally hundreds made i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while nand urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three ndespite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes nas far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legends setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities it takes place on a college campus which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer nyou see the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface nall those young people are growing up together going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows so naturally some weirdness is expected nall the better for that elusive crazed killer ncoupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task nbut alas urban legend is not only idiotic and clich full its way too clean a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity little gore and much stupidity nthis is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than i dunno exercise nits the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a runninglikethewindprey yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques nits the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack ni really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loudnoisejumpscare thing nyes the audience jumps momentarily frightened but wouldnt anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room ni lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer napparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers nin scream it was a ghost mask scary enough in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher mans rain slicker in the middle of summer no less and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ooh scary intended to conceal hisher identity nfor urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume nthough i must admit urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film nthe films killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends you know like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that theyre coming from inside the house ni wont spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used after all the film does offer fine 2 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough nsad to say it doesnt include my favorite urban legend a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil nnow that would be scary nbefore i leave you i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film the first being the lack of craft the second the lack of exploitation its characters all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people ive ever spent an evening with nonly jared leto looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day and alicia witt as the resilient heroine avoid vexatiousness nthe most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum as a supremely irritating lout so irritating i actually cheered his painful death and i am not a cruel person nironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining nafter all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i cant stand getting slaughtered which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i cant stand not getting slaughtered n
the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film nsince june i havent been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky shrieking out ahas take on me in his yellow miata nwhy would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine nhonestly i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie nman was i wrong ncorky romano is one of those throwaway clich ridden tvstartofilm vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots nfortunately for chris kattans precariously positioned career corky does have some good laughs even if most of them are of the lowestbrow variety nkattan plays the title character the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has a penchant for sunshiny 80s tunes bright ties and banal coffee mug slogans you dont have to be crazy to work here but it sure helps nwhen his mob boss dad peter falk is about to be put away on murder charges his bungling lughead brothers peter berg and chris penn rope in innocent black sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence npredictably hijinks ensue nif the basic plot sounds bad wait until you get into the innerworkings of this clunker nthe writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity ncorkys fbi agent identity is named corky pissant thats pronounced peesahn nits french nhe becomes a firstrate agent by accidentally stumbling mr magoostyle onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations which plays like something out of a sitcom nand not a good sitcom i mean nthe romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each others face nand in a scene taken straight from theres something about mary corky gives a dachshund mouthtomouth resuscitation nbut its not a complete disaster nthe manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments including a bit featuring a cat in a fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren a german shephard and a kilo of cocaine nplus berg whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope gives a great turn as the illiterate brother paulie nand its nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work nunfortunately for those out there who cant truly appreciate animal or fart jokes corky wont have much to offer you nso the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv asking who is corky nyou can simply reply who cares n
despite its exceedingly welldone visual effects 1995s original species was one big hunk of scifi cheese from the writing to the feeble performances nso coming from such bgrade roots its sequels stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising yet at the same time it is nit would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad if not even worse nsomething is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in speciesa sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alienhuman hybrid silis never entered into perhaps that was left for species iiithough im not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own nthe alien fun and games begin this time when a threeperson astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain patrick ross justin lazard late of cbss shortlived soap of a few years back central park westcpw nthis alien dna is not identical to that which created the original films sil but its close enough and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find nmeanwhile scientist dr laura baker the returning marg helgenberger has created a clone of sil named eve natasha henstridge again for research purposes nit doesnt take long for eve to sense another alien presence which send her libido into hyperdrive nits up to laura and her former partner bounty hunter press lennox michael madsen another returnee and patricks uninfected shipmate dennis gamble mykelti williamson to find patrick before the inheat eve does n this isnt the xfiles goddammit nexclaims one character in the early going nin terms of quality hes absolutely right but hes also wrong nthe new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patricks pupils to dilate once hes infected nlooks and sounds an awful lot like the xfiless black cancer to me nbut thats not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from nspecies was already a ripoff of alien but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the originals director roger donaldson did nhuman patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eves alien body which ironically was designed by alien designer h r giger na large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns naliens sans flamethrowers nthe visual effects were by far the best thing about species and the sequels effects crew at steve johnsons xfx inc keeps that highquality tradition alive no cheaplooking lost in space cgi here nafter the effects the originals best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge nhowever medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment nat one point shes called on to play alien empath la forest whitaker in the original but for most of the duration shes holed up in a glass cell nby the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place the film is well into its home stretch nso the rest of the time we are treated to patrick played with little zest by lazard none problem with the first film was that the deadly horny but innocentatheart sil was too sympathetic no such problem with patrick who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control nthe rest of the cast also fails to add much but the writing can be faulted for that nhelgenberger and madsen go through the motions but they are already hampered by the clich d development that somewhere between the two films the oncelinked laura and press stopped getting along nwilliamson suffers the worst indignity nhe tries his best to enliven the token africanamerican role but how can anyone recite insulting derivative lines such as im gonna get african on someones ass and not appear ridiculous nbut species iis worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work nat least the original featured plenty to laugh atunaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker and the sight of helgenbergers character performing fellatio on madsens for a start nbut the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level nfor all the blood and gore nudity and sex thrown in species ii is quite simply a vapid bore n
cradle will rock is the latest effort from directoractor tim robbins nwhile he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 dead man walking he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here nthe story is confusing and filled with many subplots so ill try my best and explain it as simply as possible nthe film is based on a mostly true story about a federal theater in the 1930s that produced a play the cradle will rock that apparently was offensive to some so the government shuts it down nits during the time of the depression and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs or are poor nbetween this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots about those who work in theater or those associated nalso along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience ntim robbins just keeps piling on political views and characters that we just give up on the film or in some cases walk out nfor robbins it may be a nice achievement but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue and fancy outfits ni thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast unfortunately are all uninteresting except for a few nlet me recap what each important character does so please bear with me its the least you can do especially if you were considering seeing this nill begin with those involved with the play ntheres orson welles angus macfadyen who of course is the director of the play the producer john houseman cary elwes marc blitzstein hank azaria the writer of the play emily watson a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock noutside the play theres the ventriloquist bill murray who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk joan cusack another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ruben blades whos unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage john cusack ntheres a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories susan sarandon philip baker hall too name a few but those that i mentioned were the most significant to the story nanyway most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted except for emily watson who does another great job and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack who always delivers through thick and thin nnow although most of the film was weak to say the least there were some nice moments and some involving subjects but all this is overblown nsure the free speech segment was a nice feature but not when it becomes repetitive nthe whole film is like this and its basically nothing but a headache non the brighter side tim robbins direction was masterful nhis camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas andersons latest magnolia only smoother in my opinion but even that cant make a movie that much better nalthough it has its moments not many of them but theyre there cradle will rock stays true to its title because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over n
synopsis easilyangered chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce ndiedre easily cons davids notsobright new wife molly into believing shes a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and davids quicktempered son michael ndiedre at the same time murders a bunch of people ncomments the ex is a very bad movie ni havent seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while ni kept vacillating however between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ultimately i decided to split the difference and give it two stars nas summarized briefly in the synopsis this is yet another spurnedpsycholovergetsherrevenge type movie nim not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline but it seems like 10 000 000 000 nthe ex however though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre differs slightly from the norm in that at least it doesnt take itself too seriously like so many other duds do malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind nthose involved in the movie realize theyre in a turkey apparently and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script nthe exs storyline as i said incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature however the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that after a while the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie ndiedre davids first wife kills and kills and kills for example without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like its not as though shes bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime ndavid and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael their son has emotional problems specifically his inability to control his anger nthough david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie the connection between him and his son is not made nmolly is easily swayed by diedre into believing shes a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son ntime and time again things do not add up in this movie nif a viewer cant accept this fact then he will definately not like the ex nif on the other hand he can appreciate the movie for its campiness then hell probably like it much better ni dont mean to necessarily suggest however that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp neven when viewed from an itssobaditsgood angle this movie isnt all that successful nthe ex does have its moments though almost all of which involve yancy butler the psychotic diedre and nick mancuso david nthese two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which oftentimes elicit chuckles from the audience nthe truly awful lines written for them help this humor along nbutler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue every time her character kills someone she has a punchline thats unbelievably inane nwhen she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david for example diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states im so sorry your lease is terminated nor how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene n diedres therapist wishes to have her recommitted so she decides to visit diedre alone in her new apartment never realizing of course that its not hers ntherapists typically are catatonically braindead in these movies nhaving successfully snuffed the woman out diedre looks at the body and says what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session dr jones noh thats right nim sorry but your time is up nthis is what passes for humor in the film nthe audience doesnt necessarily laugh but groan the type of groan that suggests the audience cant believe theyre watching this crap although watching it they are nnick mancusos chainsmoking nervouswreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butlers character delivers but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief nin between drags off his cigarette for instance in one of the movies best scenes david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his exwife is nin exaggerated exasperation he nearly shouts the woman is a cuckoobird n trust me it is funny in context nand so the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion ni wont reveal the ending specifically though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film nmolly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds nmolly at one point in the film notsobrilliantly observes after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her familys to spy upon them that shes crazy nyoud be pretty crazy too if youd rented this turkey nid avoid it unless its on tv and you come across it nif you do you may want to watch it groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot and feel good that you didnt spend money renting it n
starring shawnee smith donovan leitch ricky paull goldin kevin dillon billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960s classic a term that i use very loosely to define the original about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way nnow the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel nthe fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesnt exactly hurt it either nfast forward to the late 80s nsteve mcqueen isnt in the remake this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years nnor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role nthat is unless you count matt dillons brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter nthe other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original nthe only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets nit looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets nthe special effects in this movie are cheesy like the originals nunlike the original they dont look campy they just look cheap none bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith nshe is very attractive and can actually act which is more than i can say about some of her costars nin terms of plot a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky nseems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite nanyway the pink stuff has a taste for humans nthe more people it absorbs the bigger it gets nand it isnt the friendliest goop on the block either nanyway it attacks this little town and its up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it nnot really but that is how it seems nthis version attempts to recapture the camp of the original nas ive already said this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap badly acted and badly written than campy nin the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness nalthough star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon nthe reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple they all stunk out loud nalthough some of the films smaller roles are filled with some actors that while not big stars are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows nit also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible nsadly it doesnt work very well nif you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original n although that isnt so hot either nthis newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities n

 from the director of the nightmare before christmas it said in the previews which im guessing was said to get people to go see the movie obviously it hasnt worked since the 75 million dollar movie has yet to break 5 million nto each its own however since monkey bone is not only a bad movie all together but technically wellmade na tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects nstu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena monkey bone a crude comic strip that everyone wants to merchandise they go to great links to get it as well including dollars that let out fart powder nwhen stu and his girlfriend julie bridget fonda are in a freak car accident youll see stu goes into a coma and while in his coma stu travels to im guessing dark town where all the characters in dreams come to life npeople are stuck in this town with their nightmares roaming around them nwhen stu spots monkey bone whom he really cant stand he tries to keep him under control nmaking a new friend kitty rose mcgowan he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death he can go back up and live his life nwhen monkey bone and stu steal a pass monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stus body nnow monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder so everyone has nightmares or nsomething like that nrather complex in fact more than it needs to be monkey bone had potential in the script and even the story nwhat is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes and lack of character development nfor instance we really dont get to know who stu or julie are so why should we even care nkitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her but we are not given a chance to know her nthe cast is decent however brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body nbridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt her performance is bad and she seems miscast ndave foley isnt given enough to do as well as will graces megan mullally who can be funny nthe standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust nthe special effects of monkey bone is what might really bring in some curious viewers these special effects are highly effective and nice to look at with the eyes nsome of them are believable and some unbelievable for nmonkey bone he seems to be like stuart little you really dont realize that he is animated but non occasion it sneaks up on you nthe direction by henry selick is good but at times he doesnt know what kind of film he wants to make and the ending climax falls off the cliff nits too bad really monkey bone could have been a real good movie but with its heavily done hack job and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role nfor those curious however it might be worth the rental but other than that avoid this one n
arriving in a barrage of hype the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year nhowever like the golden child although blair witch has made a lot of money its not very good ndonahue williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth nthe film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles nalthough events start of normal they get weird pretty quickly while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on nalthough an interesting premise the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity nthe biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise nmost of the dialogue is adlibbed and still manages to sound like a poor bmovie nthe script eventually degenerates into shouting matches with the fword included a lot to sound like students nthere are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur but then its back to the shouting and swearing which gets very tiresome very quickly nif i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods shout a lot and swear id go on scout camp nbut no the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this but im not quite sure how nthe supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes nwith no music and no budget to work with the film has to depend on natural psychological scares which are sometimes well delivered sometimes not ni never really felt truly scared during any part of the film although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film nhowever because the actors are so irritating the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying what the f ck is that na lot and mike giggling like a loony ntheres also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things nthe main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment and are hopelessly lost heather still insists on filming it all nthe film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this but it isnt very convincing nalso the students have no idea how to survive in the woods such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation nthere are also some parts where the amateur camcorder footage is obviously staged heathers apology being a major one nthe blair witch project in the end just fails to deliver ni suppose if youve been lost camping before the film may deliver some chills but this is no use for the other 99 of the paying audience who havent been lost in the woods napart from the final minutes the film is mind boggingly unscary and the shouting matches get hideously dull nthe spook scenes are short and far between and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide nalthough a good idea its not executed well enough to be a fun scary cinema experience nits a worrying fact when the website http www blairwitch com n is better than the film n
 mandingo has traditionally been seen as one of two things either a muchneeded revisionist look at slavery in the south or in the words of film critic leonard maltin a trashy potboiler that appeals only to the sm crowd nactually i think mandingo is a strange combination of the two although it fails on both fronts nits too trashy to be good drama but too dramatic to be good trash nthe story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell james mason and his son hammond perry king none day in new orleans hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede heavyweight boxer ken norton nalthough the movie never explains it a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley naccording to the movie mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves nhammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him nhammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves nmeanwhile hammond has married his cousin blanche susan george because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild nhammond however is happier spending nights with his bed wench the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex nit is quickly apparent that hammond despite his overt racism is more in love with his bed wench a sensitive slave girl named ellen brenda sykes than he is with blanche nhammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had pleasured her before he did nof course its fine that hes slept with numerous slave girls but the fact that his wife a white lady had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her nso blanche is usually left lonely and sexstarved while hammond is sleeping with ellen nblanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a halfblack child although its okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth and hammond poisons blanche nhammond then finds mede shoots him twice in the shoulder and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water nyes you read right the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive njudging only by the plot mandingo is pure sexploitation nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society nwhen mandingo was released in 1975 it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs ndramatically mandingo is weak and unfocused and historically its mostly confused nif one were to judge history by this film it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality not economics nnot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working except for a few house servants nthe men spend most of the time sitting around while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves but mandingos overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick although theres plenty of violence fights vicious beatings shootings and the aforementioned human boiling sequence thrown in for good measure nsome tried to write off mandingo as a blaxploitation film one of a number of quicklymade lowbudget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies but its not that easy n mandingo was studiofinanced by paramount pictures and produced by dino de laurentiis the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as the bible 1966 the remake of king kong 1976 and the illfated dune 1984 nthe director was richard fleischer a veteran who was best known for several special effectsladen action movies including 20 000 leagues under the sea 1954 and fantastic voyage 1966 as well as such superior suspense films as the narrow margin 1952 nthe script based on the supermarket bestseller by ken ostott and the subsequent play by jack kirkland was penned by norman wexler who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on serpico njames mason perry king and susan george were wellknown and respected actors mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career nso why is mandingo so bad na number of reasons including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job nwexlers script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive it combines stereotyped slavetalk yessuh massuh stereotyped southern white trash talk fer whutre you gittin outta bed and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk if you see me hang you gonna know you killed a black brother nfleischers direction is clumsy especially during the fight scenes and all the actors give weak performances especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable nnevertheless credit should be given where credit is due ndespite its exploitative nature mandingo was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery nuntil then there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery neven classics such as gone with the wind 1939 can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter n mandingo reassessed the south and showed that it wasnt all beautiful plantations green fields and pretty sunsets nbut all this is constantly undermined by the films negligible pointofview it claims to see things from the black perspective but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners nwith a little more maturity and different handling mandingo might have been an effective worthwhile film nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery it never deals with them nthe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile but wexlers script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing nthere is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner but mandingo never does it nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in schindlers list 1993 by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid nthe difference between that film and mandingo is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma n mandingo is satisfied to simply show some skin and because of that its trashy potboiler nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished n
roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast who would have guessed that the most savage maddog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by nben kingsley nmy response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark henry fonda in once upon a time in the west or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it nthey should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild sympathetic or even ineffectual character roles nthe same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious nthat is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast ngary gal dove played by ray winstone has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain nlife has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing nbut his paradise is about to be shattered by a onetwopunch nthe first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa nthe second punch comes from gals past nback in london gang boss teddy bass ian mcshane tvs lovejoy is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal nhe sends his most rabid henchman don logan ben kingsley to fetch gal ndon will accept any decision gal makes from yes to certainly nhowever if gal says no don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guys exporn star wife deedee amanda redman nin the meantime don knows just how to get under everybodys skin nkingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness nthere are some serious problems in louis melliss and david scintos script that should have been caught before filming nwhen we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success nbeyond an ability to use skindiving gear no special talents are required of him nany local hood could have done what gal is needed for nadditionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault flooding the vault nno only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool nin spite of the provocative title the story is cliched and overly familiar ni know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade nthe story is usually of the reformed outlaw a robert taylor type who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability nthe old gang however wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git im nit is not a great plot nin sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards nperhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film nit is an old plot dressed up to look new nif the plot is old at least the style is creative nthis is director jonathan glazers first film but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout nhis style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences ncinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes nwe see one side of a persons faces nbut the other side fades into the darkness a sort of metaphor for the halfworld these characters inhabit nhalf of everything that is happening is also kept hidden nus yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog nat least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking the heavy accents and the cockney language nsexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre the london crime film nthe plot may be new to british crime films but it would be overly familiar as a western nfurther respectability comes from ben kingsleys highpowered performance ni give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale n

the tagline on random hearts reads in a perfect world they never would have met nin a perfect world i never would have seen this movie nthe biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film kay chandler kristin scott thomas and dutch van den broeck harrison ford are the only two major characters alive resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious twohoursandthensome production ndutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department nkay is a congresswoman from new hampshire nalthough they both think they are happily married their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs ndutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners they subsequently discover the affair nthe rest of the film is the pointless unrealistic and oftentimes boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to and getting to know each other in the process ntwo sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film ndutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare nall the great stereotypes get pulled including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter nkays distraction from the films primary focus is her campaign for reelection and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal nthese sub plots could have made for semiinteresting points but the film seems afraid to explore politics or motherdaughter relations in depth and consequently suffers nrandom hearts two primary characters seem to live in shells nalthough both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other nthere is plenty of opportunity dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships nveteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack and critically acclaimed upandcomer dylan baker both have cameo roles but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both nother than its weak plot it is hard to criticize random hearts nhowever it is also hard to compliment it nhad the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake rather than the dry one that equates to be n
you would think that this films dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy and americanizing it nyoud be wrong since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series rowan atkinson robin driscoll and richard curtis nshould you ever happen to meet those chaps do me a favor ngrab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear what were you thinking nhave you ever heard the phrase if it aint broke dont fix it nthen walk away nthe film concerns mr bean atkinson and his visit to america while escorting the painting of whistlers mother to an american buyer played by burt reynolds in the type of bit part that his success in boogie nights should hopefully do away with nnow how or why mr bean is sent on this trip makes no sense and i cant even describe how the film explains it nthe point is that mr bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble nproblems problems problems where to begin nfirst the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from beetlejuice or one note away from the score from rob roy nthen the song choices are totally uninspired n good vibrations n i love l a nwow dont put any thought into that guys nalso bean makes way too much noise in the film nthe character doesnt speak much but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience and maybe the occasional murmur from mr bean neach episode was like a chaplin silent movie nin the film bean is constantly moaning grunting whining etc its annoying and just plain wrong for the character nthe main problem though is that its just not funny nwith each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes nmultiply that running time by three however and the laughs steadily decrease nthey even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series nsad and creatively lazy nas a series mr bean only ran for about 13 episodes or so nwhy on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything n13 halfhour episodes certainly hadnt exhausted all possible situations nall i can say positively for the film at this point is that its almost appropriate for all ages if it wasnt for a couple of scenes where it appears as though mr bean is having sex with things nand even that isnt a very positive statement nplease guys go back to england and go back to television so youll make me laugh again npg13 n
 mercury rising has numerous flaws but there is one that really stands out its central plot device is unnecessary nthats right nthe major aspect of the film that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy action flicks could be dropped from the beginning and the movie would turn out exactly the same if not better nthis central device is the fact that a nineyearold boy is autistic nhis name is simon and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow alec baldwin wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent unfair world against his will with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of mercury rising ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simons character and his relationship with willis but here it is lost nmiko hughes the young actor who plays simon goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic he walks slowly drawls his words kicks and screams when hes touched and has a hard time looking at other people nits a difficult role for an adult much less a young child to play and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isnt playing like hes autistic nunlike dustin hoffmans performance in rain man or leonardo dicaprios in whats eating gilbert grape we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting nhowever unlike rain man which used its characters autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story mercury rising could go right about its generic predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid nhell he doesnt even have to be shy nin fact the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role rather than just being carted around under willis arm nwillis character art jeffries is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simons house where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide nof course we know that isnt the way it happened happen because we saw an evil squarejawed government hitman with a meanlooking crewcut knock off the parents nsimon was able to get away and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked njeffries who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it knows there is something more and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simons parents is crawling everywhere attempting to kill simon at the hospital on the highway and every other place he goes nlate in the movie jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey kim dickens who he meets at a coffee shop nof all the hardtobelieve aspects of the movie this is the worst ni can believe in the decency of the human heart but staceys character is far too accommodating nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery she lets him into her apartment at two oclock in the morning when she knows the police is after him and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences but even here mercury rising doesnt rise to the challenge nthe movie was directed by harold becker who has made some good suspense films including sea of love 1989 and malice 1993 but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman played by peter stormare that is so ineptly directed shot and edited that i had no idea 1 exactly where they were on the streetcar 2 who was hitting who and 3 where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building and features a harrowing yawn scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building not because he has to but because its more suspenseful that way ntaken as a whole mercury rising is an tepid confused movie that lacks style wit and any traces of a sense of humor nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles but here he is too straight and serious nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the

theres no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based as its opening credits proclaim on a true story nbut if its an accurate picture of life on americas mean streets than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought nfor from the films outset when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction nour eponymous hero johnny depp is not the cheap crook he first appears to be nbrasco is joseph pistone an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chummingup to lefty al pacino a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a wiseguy nregrettably pistone learns his lessons all too well nhis concern for lefty who is burdened with a heroin addicted son exacerbates his own family troubles his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husbands gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing ntrue the focus on pistones family life does deviate from the typical gangsterflick formula but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins nthe unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawnout domestic squabbles including an illadvised marriage guidance routine that slow the film down unnecessarily nthe biggest problem with donnie brasco however is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors nthe awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70s but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style i loved those fluoro coloured suits of scorces costume drama casino nmore importantly pacinos presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively ndonnie brascos take on american values for instance is feeble and obvious nlefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music ninexplicably leftys horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us nit doesnt any more than his family troubles do which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistones njust think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface nin these pictures pacinos dedication to a peculiar and bloody hypercapitalism was twisted and confronting while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations ndonnie brascos tawdry little crime therefore isnt so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes but the shameless way in which it sanitises them n oh and by the way i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot pipstones superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination is that a damn you mcbain ni hear from springfield way nso the movie is cliched nbig deal what do you expect from a gangsterflick nwell you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre ndonnie brasco fails on both counts nthe action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depps woeful performance tends to smother the goodwork of his comrades nadmittedly pacino does nothing new and michael madsen sonny simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr white but both possess an unmistakable sly charm ndepp usually exhibits a bit of class himself but regrettably being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him starstruck for he is completely hellbent on mimicking pacinos wellearned high style nthe consequences are painful to watch nits no exaggeration to say that the films credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone familys uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinners phony brooklyn accent nperhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco nmaybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks nif this is indeed the case surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that americas underworld is committed to emulating albeit in heavily attenuated form their movie namesakes ndepp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic bigscreen gangster greats nwho knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen nbut then again perhaps donnie brasco isnt so true after all n

susan grangers review of ghosts of mars sony pictures entertainment nhorror auteur john carpenter halloween vampires strikes out with this scifi ecofable thats so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got greenlit nthe script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last years pitch black involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from bloodthirsty marauding aliens nin the year 2176 there are 640 000 earthlings on mars living in a matriarchal society led by a commander played by pam grier ngrier pillpoppin natasha henstridge and some rookie mars police officers clea duvall jason statham travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch desolation williams thats ice cube to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder nbut when theyre besieged by demented zombielike bodysnatching miners they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection nit seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and soon after most of the miners went bonkers as longdormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies lopping off heads as vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet according to a scientist joanna cassidy ncarpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the night of the living dead like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing nbut you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed along with the order of their elimination non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 ghosts of mars thuds to a laborious bottomofthebarrel 1 nperhaps indeed there is a curse on mars films if you recall two other duds mission to mars and red planet n
play it to the bone the newest addition to ron sheltons sports themed repertoire fails in numerous ways nlike most of sheltons other great films bull durham white men cant jump this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots nsheltons films are not considered sports films but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story nshelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions nplay it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse nthe film has no social message like its predecessors nthe relationship between the friends two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars is very confusing for a number of reasons nthe whole film since it is primarily a buddy picture depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other nunfortunately it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below n1 we never see how cesar antonio banderas and vince woody harrelson meet nthe two are so different from each other that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory n2 vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas nthere is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something n3 the third character on the trip grace lolita davidovich stands in the way nshe is in nearly every scene with them making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other n4 there are two many interfering irrelevant side stories nvince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner nthese boring tales only hurt the central plot n5 when it comes to time for the two men to fight they dont even hesitate to pound each other nwasnt the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other nby the time the road trip part of the movie is over with the film wants to be over nshelton on the other hand continues to tell his story nforty five painful minutes remain nthe boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies nhowever the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile kind of like the whole film n
the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission nhe attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth but misses nafter they ricochet off his face he says not a good start nas it turns out this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence but to the rest of the movie as well nin this the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong chan plays an international operative codenamed condor and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazis during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war nfor some reason condor is given his mission at the u s embassy in spain ni think this may have been done so that in a chase scene they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart nwatch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country most notably in europe nthe chase will take itself through a marketplace and a fruit cart will be overturned nits almost a guarantee nanyway ncondor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly nto help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly condor is accompanied by a desert expert carol cheng and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold eva cobo nthere arent supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something nalthough these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts nin fact most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight ni suppose this isnt so bad since chans action is really the best part of the movie and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway nif youve never seen a jackie chan movie dont expect a great plot but do expect to be entertained by his moves nthey are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human nknowing that he does his own stunts and knowing that this is the real stuff no computermasked bungee cords here makes the action sequences all the more exciting nyouve got to hand it to a guy whos probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art nalso of note in this as in any jackie chan movie is the humor nas far as i know none of his films take themselves too seriously and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongueincheek quality about them nwhat is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes nunlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme where the fights get you on the visceral level fight scenes in chans movies are simply entertaining nyou marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh nunfortunately even chans mastery cant save this film nthe plot and characters are so weak that they dont hold the movie together at all and the acting is terrible ncarol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off nthis combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying n
back in 1980s chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films nhe couldnt of course top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shootem up and beatem up genre aficionados nthat quantity was mostly provided by cannon group prolific production company that dominated the bmovie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap formulaic and more often than not unwatchable genre products nthe hitman 1991 action thriller directed by chucks brother aaron is one of the last among them nchuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed shot and left for dead by his partner which shouldnt surprise anyone considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks specialised for roles of usually very mean characters nsurviving the shooting cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent nhe infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations italians french canadians and iranians nsince it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris at least not in this kind of movie the biggest attraction of this film should have been action nwell the action in this film falls flat it is boring repetitive and not at all exciting nit is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films nwe know very little about norris character while on the other hand gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension nin the end we almost feel sorry for them since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade nduring the film somebody obviously became aware of that problem so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris nthat caused another problem any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation nthe photography in this film is dark setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it n
when i watch a movie like mike nichols what planet are you from ni cant help but feel like everyone is looking at me nits as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness eyes shooting daggers quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hardearned money to spend their time watching this nthis nthing ni shift uncomfortably in my seat nim reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second or thirdrate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted funny conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award nits not my fault i know its not my fault but dammit someones gotta be embarrassed because it doesnt look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame nim about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together garry shandling annette bening john goodman greg kinnear mike nichols ndo any of these names make you instantly shudder nthe answer i would have come up with before today is no this is quite a list of talented individuals weve got here ngranted john goodman was in the flintstones and greg kinnear has turned in some lessthanlackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours but even so theyve got proven power as excellent supporting players ngarry shandling has two television classics under his belt his ingenious little its garry shandlings show and the larry sanders show nand for gods sake mike nichols directed the graduate and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty nso explain this nthis nthing nwhat planet are you from npurports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole poppsychology marsvenus phenomenon nbut what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringeinducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringeinducing moments the end result is unsurprisingly an unfunny uninsightful cringeinducing thoroughly icky embarrassment ngarry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males they reproduce through cloning of course nhis leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth find a female of the species and impregnate her ntheyre taught how to pretend that theyre listening by nodding and saying uhhuh and how to compliment shoes nimagine my delighted surprise when oh heavens all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably producing comedic results nthe lucky winner is fitted with a penis since theirs after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence ni will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that theyre all just clones nwhoops too late nthe penis when aroused tends to make a humming noise nthe writers when frequently strapped for ideas tend to turn to this as a source of comedy nit isnt funny the first time nit isnt funny the eighth time nit isnt funny the eighteenth time nif anything it made me feel vaguely selfconscious ngarry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear who turns out to be a generic unlikable scumbag nhes meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandlings alien character but hes so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside nkinnears scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks nwow nwhat a magnificent bastard nnearly every man in the movie in fact is played as the same sort of sexdriven slimeball nwhen kinnears wife walks into the office there isnt a single guy who doesnt trip bump into a wall or otherwise pratfall as if theyd never seen a woman before nthe few guys that arent particularly slimeballs such as john goodmans detective character are simply uncommunicative workaholics nshandling meets up with annette bening who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed at one of kinnears aa meetings nshandlings mission is to have a baby and when he reveals his desires to her bening instantly falls for him and the next day nthey get married nyup nthe next day ncuz ya see it turns out she wants a baby too nbenings character perhaps was the most difficult to watch especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty nif her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole then woe i say to the species nshes unfathomably insecure and succumbs so easily to all of shandlings lines and lies that it borders on tragic ntheres a point where after thinking she may not be able to bear children she learns that she is indeed pregnant nwhen garry comes home after nearly cheating on her she strolls into the kitchen and sings high hopes you know the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song to deliver the news and then says to him now you cant leave me nwere supposed to empathize with shandlings discovery of the feeling of guilt but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing nand eventually shandling falls in love with her nfor real i suppose though im not sure exactly what prompted it nwhats the message i derive from all this nmen are liars inherently empty creatures but if you hang around long enough nwell maybe something will click nha ha nha nim thankful such broad cynicism isnt frequently allowed to run so rampant nlets all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one ntheres also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity ngoodman through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic vibrating penis nit has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered that thankfully never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition ninstead it just dangles limply on the branch for a while withers and falls away nfurther proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies nbut lets not dwell on this any longer ive already wasted plenty of your time and my own nlets move on forget about what weve seen here and get on with our lives nand to help us out lets end things on a happy note ncongratuations go out to annette bening winner of this weeks title naward for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movies name n
the new austin powers film continues a movie tradition begun in the eighties nproduce something anything that will get the high school and junior high kids in the theater because they buy more soda and popcorn than senior citizens nthe usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here ngross humor sex jokes silly sight gags more sex jokes nand the film is a strong contender in the current race to be cruder grosser and more outrageous than that last film nwhat the film is not however is funny nthe plot centers around the return of dr evil who goes back in time to steal austin powers mojo a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austins pelvis which gives austin his sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies naustin must go after him and returns to the swinging sixties where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday ni almost avoided this film because i did not like the original nbut the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film received many good reviews ni wish i had stuck to my first impression nmyers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation nand he has the talent to do it at least as an actor nbut the material he is working with here much of it his own falls short of anything resembling comic genius nthis movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces a fivehundredpound fat mans butt crack and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average 15 year old nafter some of these scenes one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to get an audiences attention nthe direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic humor nfor the most part i felt as if i was watching a saturday morning chalderns live action tv show nthere is no sense of comic timing or subtlety nthe director just throws the material at us giving us nothing except the hope that anyone with a camera could be a film director ni am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under 22 crowd at least the ones who have yet to discover literacy ncertainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as in your face kick you in the teeth take no prisoners actionverb blah blah blah nif you see the film and you find youre not laughing there is nothing wrong with you nit just means you grew up since seventh grade n
in the first death wish movie mildmannered new york architect paul kersey played by charles bronson was avenging the death of his wife nin the second he was avenging his daughter nin the third he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend nfourth movie on the other hand begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen played by kay lenz nhowever since this is death wish movie we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for nthis time karens teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways nkerseys new targets unlike the previous movies arent the ordinary street punks but rich heavily armed and wellconnected drug dealers neven such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support and it comes from the publisher nathan white john p ryan determined to avenge the drugrelated death of his own daughter nwhites plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them nthe plan begins to take shape but kerseys actions bring attention of two police detectives reiner george dickerson and nozaki soon teckoh nfourth and unfortunately not the final installment in the death wish series will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade nhowever although some critics might argue death wish 4 the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 paul kersey one of the most intriguing and potentially controversial characters of the 1970s is still being dumbed down by mediocre script and charles bronson really doesnt feel the need to put much effort in his acting nhowever the hand of a veteran director j lee thompson seems more capable of michael winners and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring nthere are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end nthe script even tries to fake some social conscience through criminally underused kay lenzs character and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years nthere are even some halfhearted attempts of humour both intentional and unintentional like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronsons 1970s classics n special note to xphiles mith pilleggi the actor who plays ad skinner in the x files could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman n
 alcohol and drugs bad nnot alcohol and drugs good ngot it njust when you though youve seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen be that insanity or alcoholism hollywood releases yet another one of those deep emotional stories about finding yourself n28 days is practically a visualization of the usual meaningful true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aameetings ngwennie sandra bullock is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol nfor her life was a big party with no beginning and no end nthis behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself nher existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes nsuch as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper dominic west borrowed her sisters elizabeth perkins wedding limo and crashed it into someones house nthis time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in courtordered rehab nhere she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption willpower and commitment nmost important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party nthe film itself feels like a rehab program whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times nit is a classic cautionary tale nan echo na big fat and expensive clich na shadow of last years girl interrupted which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like the cuckoos nest and trainspotting ndirector betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review nfor some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a dramacomedy njokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues alienation despair terror confusion loneliness nand what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean nisnt that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place neven the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park betty thomas idea of hell is a cozy homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke drink or watch tv after 11 nit is simply too light simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously nbut the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance nthat it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story n all you need to do is just say no says dr cornell steve buscemi as if was the revelation of the century nand thats how simple it is nin fact i would rather watch lost in space once again than return to 28 days nas for acting its acceptable but hardly anything else nfor sandra bullock its an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than speed nshe handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop ndominic west shines as the source of gwenies devilish temptations but elizabeth perkins and steve buscemis great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters nalthough intellectually girl interrupted was a greater achievement 28 days is superior in its visual aspect nthere are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor nthe most important thing is that weve seen it before and it was a lot better nclean and sober only when i laugh when a man loves a woman leaving las vegas and many other stronger films were made about the same issues nso whats the point nin other words 28 days doesnt contribute to the moviemaking business on any level nif youre caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and youre standing in front of the movie theatre you might as well go in and watch 28 days nunder all other circumstances stay away because this film equals 8 and 103 minutes lost n
it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch nbased on the late 1960s television show by the same name the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover nhowever things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion nof course the ads make it seem like so much more nquick cuts cool music claire danes nice hair and cute outfits car chases stuff blowing up and the like nsounds like a cool movie does it not nafter the first fifteen minutes it quickly becomes apparent that it is not nthe mod squad is certainly a slick looking production complete with nice hair and costumes but that simply isnt enough nthe film is best described as a cross between an hourlong cop show and a music video both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half nand with it comes every single clich nit doesnt really matter that the film is based on a television show as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything weve already seen nthe characters and acting is nothing spectacular sometimes even bordering on wooden nclaire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored which really transfers onto the audience nthe only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi who plays the resident crazy man ultimately being the only thing worth watching nunfortunately even hes not enough to save this convoluted mess as all the characters dont do much apart from occupying screen time nwith the young cast cool clothes nice hair and hip soundtrack it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset ndespite an american r rating which the content does not justify the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset ninformation on the characters is literally spoonfed to the audience would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us dialogue is poorly written and the plot is extremely predictable nthe way the film progresses you likely wont even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy because youll know they arent nbasing the show on a 1960s television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand even one thats missing a finger or two nthe number of times that i checked my watch six is a clear indication that this film is not one of them nit is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar judging from the rash of really awful teenflicks that weve been seeing as of late navoid this film at all costs n

disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life richard leonardo dicaprio sets off for thailand nthere he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy robert carlyle who gives him a map to a beach a secret utopia then commits suicide nrichard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel tienne guillaume canet and fran oise virginie ledoyen nonce they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach there richard falls for fran oise nthis covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element which is solely a creation of hollywood seems to hold to the original novel nthe cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking ni dont think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning nbut that is were many things go wrong darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography nthough the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking nthe plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts nthis is where the movie has some great potential then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better yes folks i said better nnow up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise nthis is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost unwatchable nthere is even a video game style sequence that borders on the disgusting it doesnt make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion and i am hoping many other peoples ni am hoping that in my little rant ive made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing so if you go see it and you dont like it because of this dont blame me nthe character development was not up to par either i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child nalthough there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard leos character comes off as a wannabe philosopher nthe character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason granted some people are like this myself included but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does nthe next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough nrichard is obviously obsessed by fran oise at the early stages of the story yet there is actually very little development along this story line nthis i am sure contributes to the movies lack of core plot and being unfocused nnow i shall move onto something a little better about the movie for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it nthe cast and acting was passable at the very least and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard nmind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better nwhich begs the question why is leonardo paid so much n i think this is a topic all on its own so i wont get into it nbut i like the fact that there was an international cast used had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible nthe international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable nnot to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense nwhen all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable ni would not recommend this movie to anyone the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story nas it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt nif you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings n
the generals daughter is a heartless absurd film a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters ndirector simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with hamhanded obscenity creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudodepth nwhats worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm njohn travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess playing warrant officer paul brenner brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell leslie stefanson daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell nbrenner is teamed up with exspouse sarah sunderland madeline stowe and they check out all the suspects on the base including elizabeths mentor colonel moore james woods nsoon it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff but the question comes down to why and of course who neberts law of the economy of characters can be applied here one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point including the two protagonists but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story nperhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that but its painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something non a story level the generals daughter is ineptly constructed nthe film adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demilles novel which was apparently based on a true story plods along to its conclusion filling in the blanks with stale unrealistic dialogue and shocking plot developments nhaving not read the novel its difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree nscene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity minutes after finding the dead young woman brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue which includes endless strings of forced lines n sunderland actually asks brenner why was she killed nto which i would have answered if i knew then the movie would already be over nonly after weve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together this angle though apparently present to develop their characters is never explored nnot that it really matters since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot nin one scene sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask nshe sees one of his rings and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring ninstead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect they take him to brenners houseboat beat him up and pour hot coffee in his lap nthis scene really pushed me over the edge not because its gratuitous and meanspirited but because it illustrates the films complete disregard for the characters and the audience nit was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise ni realized that these constructs on screen arent actually characters but devices present only to serve the story nthis would have been bad enough without the wests need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct ncompelling films about sexual crimes dont spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks and they certainly dont show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture nthese scenes are not the least bit powerful on the contrary theyre intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain whomever that may turn out to be nin addition the movie treats sexual fetishes and sadomasochism in particular as if its a perversion of everything we know to be pure nthis standpoint is certainly allowed but only in accompaniment with welldeveloped themes to back it up nas it is the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane nperhaps the only positive elements in the generals daughter are a couple of the performances njames woods has a few terrific scenes and plays his role with sharp witty subtlety ni also liked james cromwell mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous nnonetheless these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization nthe generals daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film it pretends to have a soul to be of strict moral code when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cutouts forcefeeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and onesided moral judgments n
the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as anywhere but here nthere isnt one thing about this motherdaughter relationship melodrama that felt honest nit relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives as for some reason they couldnt figure it out for themselves nif the film looks familiar that is because the slums of beverly hills 98 went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with nalvin sargents script was weak and annoyingly claustral nwayne wangs the joy luck club inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldnt convey npushy mother adele august susan sarandon forces her 14yearold daughter ann natalie portman to leave a small midwestern burg to go crosscountry with her to beverly hills nthe daughter resents her twice divorced unstable but exotic schoolteacher mother bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life nthe daqughter doesnt even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and cant stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio nso it becomes a question of who knows best as the ladies fight it out between them until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner nadeles dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesnt look that good as she lands a job in a slum school has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive ndaughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there nduring one of many arguments with her freespirited mom they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed she runs away only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop michael milhoan who offers her wise counsel nwith the cops zen wisdom passed onto the daughter she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla nduring their stay in beverly hills she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer a t s neliot corbin allred reader nbut the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality as everything seemed staged and unemotional nwhen she learns her cousin benny shawn hatosy who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasnt clearly shown why she wants to stay there and for that matter it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly nthe film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams ni guess what the filmmaker is trying to say is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one able to recognize mothers faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself nmother has a series of setbacks like being dumped by her dreamboat dentist bochner she met on the beach and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part nbut mother learns that her daughter has grownup and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her nshe learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do nthis of course results in the corny ending showing that moms heart was always in the right place only she went about it in the wrong way nthis was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing n

the premise of the new james wong film final destination is that alex browning the protagonist prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane thereby cheating fate nhowever fate is not so easily bested and alexs friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances nessentially this premise is a cleverway to make a slasherflick without the slasher nunfortunately this is practically the only clever thing about the film nas far as teen horror flicks go final destination is better than many nthere is enough shocking death graphic gore and requisite black humor to provide the essential roller coaster type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick nunfortunately this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre nthe relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to setup the next death nthe scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed nif you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date this film might do the trick nother than that wait until it goes into heavyrotation on cable n
capsule combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark a dash of a jackie chan movie sans jackie two teaspoons of gun and swordplay and a dollop of cgi nsimmer for 100 minutes nyields zilch nthe phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier better movies that after the fifteenminute mark i started cataloguing them out loud nits hard to make a good actionadventure movie that doesnt simply recycle its predecessors and ive seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully nthe phantom allegedly based on the longrunning comic of the same name doesnt even bother to be graceful nits a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list but ill try nthe film opens up with a prelude sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voiceover to compensate for whatever got thrown out nwe go from there to a jungle sequence that i swear to god recycles the truckchase scene from raiders of the lost ark notefornote possibly even shotforshot right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush and then goes on to rip off the ropebridge scene from sorcerer as well nsorcerer as you may well remember was a remake of a french movie the wages of fear in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain nboth versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick but ive got my job to do so back to the salt mines we go nanyway the cinematic theft doesnt stop there nor at least the lack of inspiration nthere isnt a single thing here we havent seen and its not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest nwe have wheres my list na bad girl a tough good girl a secret cave hideaway which seems inspired more by dr nno than anything else a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality magical artifacts of terrible power and caryhiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself nwhat else is there nthe plot is a waste of time nthe sets alternate between big but hokey and tiny and still hokey nthere are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked and im sure once mike and the bots get the cash theyll stick it on their sked nthe only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane hes a good actor and he tries very hard even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another nall i can say is that i pray this isnt the beginning of the end for him although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comicbook superhero movie n
as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment hollywood doesnt loose the oppertunity to get involved by telling stories and expressing opinions nthis film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels hays hodges tommy lee jones and terry childers samuel l jackson nthey fought side by side in vietnam where childers saved hodges life by shooting an unarmed pow nthats against the rules of war but understandable in this story anyway under the specific circumstances ncertainly hodges is not complaining nyears pass nhodges whose wounds make him unfit for action gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer nchilders is now a respected and muchdecorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould nbecause of his excellent record childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ben kingsley cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops nchilders does what he has to do evacuate the family and protect the men under his command nafter three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd nmore than 80 yemeni men women and children are mowed down nchilders is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians nhe persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film ndid childers violate authorized u s military rules of engagement nor are there simply no rules in war nthe answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions nthe murder of 83 innocent civilians has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u s where is the accusations from the arab leaders nwhere is the u n nthe film ends without even telling the most interesting story what happens on the international arena nthis film in a way akin to films such as a few good men has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism nthese accusations are pretty heavy but also unfair nwhat director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking none of the earliest apparent problems with rules of engagement is its lack of credibility nthe entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now but is overdone contrived and unrealistic as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed na lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality nthat is precisely why its not offensive nit is completely unobjective nmany stories are started and never finished nmany questions are asked but never answered na lot of parallels are referring to nothing nit seems that neither the director producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film nis it about arab mentality namericas foreign policies namericas role in the world ncorruption in the higher circles nit goes on and on nit consists of countless stories but not a definable plot nit tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one ni think that it is ironic because director william friedkins probably most acclaimed film was the exorcist which had a silly story but became a rather effective film nin this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film nthough several scenes bare the mark of professionalism such as the impressive battle scenes his latest film does simply not engage ni believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed nits obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe nthe characters feel designed unreal merely shadows with no life outside the conflict neven the actors can not save this film from going under nthough both jackson and jones act admirably with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this it is not something that these great actors can boast of nthey have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back njackson is gray and jones uninteresting nthe rest of the cast including ben kingsly blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks nthe time has come for the verdict non the charges of complete lack of objectivity i find this film guilty non the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking i find it guilty nbut on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty because of its inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere not only when concerning the arab population ni must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood badguys nthis is very sad since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth nhowever it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states nand that its not a coincidence that u s residents in the middle east including yemen are on constant maximum alert n

there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of scream queen in the early 80s ntwo of them were halloween movies but the other two prom night and terror train were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween nthe same god im scared theres some guy in a mask coming after me routine she did in john carpenters classic jamie lee copies here with none of the urgency or suspense nterror train takes place on where else a train charted by some premed students finishing their first four years of higher education nmost of them wont make it to med school though and its obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains i wish to hell theyd put a radio on that train nthe conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone even jamie lee nfrom the beginning hes talking his head off he tells one of his coworkers think on this whens the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station nas if it makes any kind of sense and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles nof course the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it ni forgot to mention the prologue nits a party three years earlier with the same group of students ntwo of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge promising him hes going to get laid nthey send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in noticing a form on the bed nshe says kiss me kenny and he kisses the body on the bed which happens to be a cadaver n oh my god they killed kenny nyou bastards nits a sick trick and one jamie lee wasnt let in on nshe still hasnt forgiven the guy as they board the terror train you asshole you cant have a good time without hurting somebody nthe killing starts before the train even leaves the station nsince its new years everyones wearing disguises a convenient plot device weve seen before and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no ones looking nat least one of the characters says its a groucho mask when the killer dons it and steps aboard it looks like gene shalit who by the way would make a great killer in a slasher movie nspeaking of weirdlooking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene one of terror trains most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield as the magician who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music nthen theres his greatest trick getting laid with hair that looks like that nfor all its attempts at visual style and substance terror train is more lionel than amtrak more prom night than halloween and nothing really worth watching nonly diehard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield if he truly has any fans should even attempt to watch it nand it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse ni mean when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station anyway nterror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car n

according to popular film opinion a films greatness is determined by time ntake for example casablanca ngreat film even today nits still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic nanother example would be star wars which had a very very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before nbut as i rewatched independence day when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 i kinda felt like it wasnt as cool as when i had first seen it ni had liked it when i saw it the first time was my original view and basically saw it as a good escape film nbut when i rewatched it i felt cheated nthus the curse of the event film n independence day is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once except for a couple kids the critics in this situation nbut after a while this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one nwell this kid is the event film in my little analogy nand when i rewatched independence day not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen but i felt insulted the whole time nthere are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just arent sure if its comedy or hokey drama none scene youll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch the next youll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around saying corny lines nthe worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of glen or glenda nnow this annoying kids problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once he shows he has no balls nand independence day has no balls nit plays it safe everywhere nit throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films nthe chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of star wars ni mean isnt that devils den nand the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moores breasts in striptease ntheyre these octopus men boring freaking octopus men ni mean come on nthe aliens in 2001 were more interesting and you didnt even see them nbasically the plot is straight from a bmovie from the 50s aliens come to earth and we wonder if theyre hostile or peaceful nokay its an interesting topic but its not handled greatly nnow they arent and somehow a computer geek jeff goldblum figure out theyre using our satellites as a countdown to destruction nyep nthese aliens are not only heavily armed theyre stupid too nthey also use the same kind of computer as we do but that comes about later nthe president bill pullman whos under attack for being a wimp decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent and he decides hell stay in the white house which the aliens have covered ni dont care if its bob freaking dole in the white house get him out of there ni dont care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol just get him out of there nlater on hes stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship ni think its time for impeachment for this guy nhes more senile than reagan on pot nthen theres a cocky pilot will smith who is the only person to survive the counterattack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 the films only sign of being brave nhis girlfriends a stripper sharing a subplot with striptease in that she has to do it for her son ncome on she has a fighter pilot boyfriendsoontobe fiance ni think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers nshes also the few the proud the lucky to survive the igniting of l a as well as her dog who narrowly survives nthere are some bright spots nthey tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing nthe best one is when jeff goldblum nicely named david turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says good morning dave nand they even played r e m s n its the end of the world as we know it and i feel fine at the beginning nand judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great hes a stereotype but i just loved the man anyway nbut there are no real subtle comic moments nwill gets way too many oneliners and he has no one to play off of execept jeff towards the end and the two do great nas i said this film has no balls nit is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and thats what it is nbut after a couple months we all move on to the next event film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure nbut at least the indy ones last for a lifetime nthis ones short on batteries n
reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger scream 3 and arlington rd are the others each derivative in their own special way nthe guy cant seem to write believable dialogue sample from reindeer games rule 1 never put a car thief behind the wheel create multifaceted characters or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard oh you thought my movie was gonna go here f ck you jack ass take that twist decipher this mother f cker nits almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is nauteur theory be damned its krugers style not the directors that winds up on screen nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut sometimes less is more nand his numerous twists cant even claim to be originals arlington rds ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j pakula thriller the parallax view and in reindeer games we get this ol gem character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldnt know pronouns used to protect the gender of the character grammar nbe damned n how did you know that nthe stunned protagonist asks suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along n n nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue and seeing as how krugers screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending i guess its no wonder why he works so frequently nhes quickly becoming miramaxs mickey mouse the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects nthis is appropriate considering that miramax which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports life is beautiful and freddie prinze jr vehicles ntheir companys current logo could be we ride the trends nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick naffleck is such a puppy dog that its impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyones bitch nthe role itself is so badly written the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it the twists so outrageous and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent serious movie getting nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy whos played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance njames frain is nick rudys cellmate a manslaughterer whos found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason charlize theron nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though shes never seen one picture of him nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a nearriot and rudy who was to be paroled on the same day as nick takes his place which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy so frenzied it kinda looks like rape and a surprise visit from ashleys brother gabriel gary sinise who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish cohorts nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley used to work as a guard in the indian casino nthough by the end the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything ive described might as well be irrelevant nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on several scenes in which after catching his prey the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid oneliner nincluded two 2 scenes of two 2 different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him one following the other no less nthough its an action film the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on incredulous as the audience nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career fell off the alist following a string of flops and now in his old age is slowly climbing his way back up nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin one of those almost but not quite movies which followed the island of dr morneau n you remember the one with marlon brando in mime makeup and a not so flattering moomoo and now this nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brainzapped mtv audience to pick apart nproblem is these action scenes nearly all failed escapes serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play ncharacter problems abound rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre the latter of which is not at least at this point something ben affleck is capable of pulling off nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster ncharlize theron an extraordinary talent is like affleck playing whatever part the script requires her to play whether it be vulnerability at one moment anger at the next nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this ngary sinise has played this role frequently and here as in snake eyes he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more that it becomes more of an annoyance oh there he goes again than a threat nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience n
for a good ten years or so super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene nnow he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo who launched chows super stardom in the acclaimed a better tomorrow by moving to hollywood ni had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them nchow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt nhis final job requires him to kill a policemans seven year old boy nthis he refuses do and runs nhowever he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job ncue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot outs which take place in various locations nsome thought had gone into making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring nthe car wash scene i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked ntut tut nthe emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie and not on the content nmia sorvino a passport forger is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun ndirector antoine arqua has clearly not observed chows excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots nchows trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale which in fairness is quite good and theres not even a toothpick in site nand as for making chow shoot like a cop well thats damned unforgiveable nto round up the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow nit would appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video nthis is not what we wanted at all considering john woo was the exec producer n did he have no say so at all nwatch the killer again and weep at the difference nreview by chris hill n theres room at the top they are telling you still but first you must learn how to smile as you kill if you want to be like the folks on the hill n
well there goes another one nsadly this like other movies this year wasnt good nthis one being almost as bad as the omega code but not quite nfrom the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad and well i guess i was right nwith bad excuses for acting a horrible screenplay and straightout bad direction the bachelor is a terribly unfunny movie that doesnt work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance nthe two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best nthe movie is troubled from the start because chris odonnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date nhere is the stupid plot chris odonnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend he meets anne rene zellwegar they instantly hit it off and are together for three years njimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up nhe really doesnt realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her what he wants i never did catch nso he proposes in a really bad way and she shoots him down and is very mad nhe of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any nthen his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars as nlong as he marries before the next day at 6 05 pm nnow jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her or get married to someone else to get the money itself leading to an unfunny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths nok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest cliched silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs neven the supporting roles of artie lange hal holbrook and ed anser arent even good nthe plot was a good idea but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old nthe choppy dialogue and bad directing dont help things any neven though chris odonnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him nrene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming sweet and likable performance as usual and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout nher sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen nbrooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a bigheaded mogul who after a while became routine and old none really cant help but think that we have seen this stuff before nits not like this is an original idea and in the end everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness nthe bachelor works on no good levels and in fact doesnt work at all ned anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career nchris odonnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal nhe seems held back and really doesnt get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old nartie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and unnerving nwhy the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know nmaybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success and sometimes i dont agree with other critics on movies even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts nits based on the 1925 silent film seven chances which i am sure is very better than this mess neven though some may think of this as a good date movie most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back nbesides being a terrible movie the bachelor is well a terrible movie nit has nothing worth recommending therefore i really cant recommend this movie ni did not have a good time and i laughed only three times nthe running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes nparts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time nbeing one of the worst movies of the year we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies and if they do they i give up on filmmakers n
im not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream but im guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft nseriously this ideaa psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legendsis a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off nthe first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue nan example that car crash mustve been awful for neveryone involved nyou can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said just no one figured out what ni know in slasher movies there isnt supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself dont mind cardboard cutouts but please dont let the cutouts be so damn bland none reason movies like scream star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters naside from jared leto and joshua jackson who arent on the screen long enough no one in urban legend makes the grade nalicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive not to mention as dumb as a post through 34 of the film and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot ngood thing brad dourif is here but wait hes only in the movie for five minutes and hes just redoing his goodnatured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoos nest nwhich brings me to another aspect of urban legend its unoriginality nthe film most blatantly ripped off is scream another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after cravens and williamsons great success nurban legend tries to deconstruct modernday folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films but it doesnt quite succeed nits best stab at selfreflexivity is poking fun at that girl in the noxzeema ad ie rebecca gayheart we also have another killertauntinghisvictimonthephone routine in urban legend and quick what movie is this exchange of dialogue from nfemale protagonist why nvillain why nwhy ncongratulations to those of you who answered scream andor urban legend nlike i said this movie couldve been great nif only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script nstill at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer n

before the remake of psycho appears weve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film dial m for murder nas usual hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing nthe film opens with emily paltrow and david viggo mortensen having fun in an loft apartment nthe problem is paltrow is married to stephen douglas who is not too happy when he discovers this affair nif i was paltrow though id definitely go with mortensen nless wrinkles nanyhow stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition hell pay him to kill his lovely wife nmortensen agrees but the murder goes awry and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses nunfortunately the film dosent progress very fast nin fact it moves like a tortoise with arthritis read very very slow nthe plot moves nowhere fast and only becomes exciting in very short bursts nnot too good for a thriller nalso the performances apart from douglas are below par npaltrow showing immense talent in se7en 1995 and sliding doors 1997 is strangely stilted even unconvincing in this movie nmortensen is a little bit better coming across as a younger douglas but his role isnt meaty enough to show all his talent nwhich leaves douglas to waltz away with the film which is does nhowever i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking drinking womanizer with a creepy underside nalso popping up in the film is david suchet playing a shifty looking detective nagain its not a character were seeing on the screen its david suchet nthe director who bought us the fugitive piles on all the flash techniques such as zoomins quick cuts etc the lighting is also interesting nhowever looks cant save this film from the depths of mediocre and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway nthe screenplay is o k but theres some hackneyed subplot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street again and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched nthe characters also make incredibly dumb moves especially paltrow and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel nwith a combination of no tension drama or decent characters a perfect murder is a failure all round and an incredible disappointment nthere are a few bright moments but they are far and few between nthe last thing a thriller should be is boring and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas you wouldnt be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder noverall rating nreview by david wilcock 1998 n you know for kids norville barnes n

they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movies poster no sequel nscary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor and it is not because the wayans brothers shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera dont try nwhat defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof nthe first movie an outrageous lowbrow savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer succeeded because of its takenoprisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue familiar and popular nin scary movie 2 the filmmakers take on the haunted houseghost story format which if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series nscary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn nof course split pea soup is the punch line an overabundant amount which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive nbut this precredit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project nsome of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original but they lack that takenoprisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque nscary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball and the films what lies beneath and hannibal features that only faired adequately at the box office john woos mission impossible 2 and charlies angels nit is as if the wayans and their team of writers at least seven are credited just threw ideas in a blender and hoped theyd coalesce nthey dont nwhile the pace of the original left you breathless the sequel moves with the speed of an 18wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road nyou can almost hear the reels panting nscary movie 2 tries very hard to live up to its original but it falls very short nits a dissatisfying spectacle a very weak sister of a very good movie nthe really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is n

here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kongrecipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter nthese kinds of movies are marked by an eyeopening sequence that introduces us to the main characters a lifeanddeath plot in which these characters become involved the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ridiculous subplots and sunglasswearing henchmen nthat is not to say that i dont like hong kong influenced movies however it is quite obvious that these moviemakers havent a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hiphoptalking thugs and stupid sight gags nobserve the opening sequence na band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment led by melvin mark wahlberg and cisco lou diamond phillips nthey are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles nhowever their partner is unsure of which cable to cut nhe is undecided nthis happens for about 10 seconds nthe audience finds some humor in his foolishness nthe lights suddenly go out ncisco is surprised and says whoa lets ngo nand they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence nthe big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film nneeding cash cisco devises a plan to kidnap the daughter china chow of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi nhowever the daughter is also the goddaughter of paris avery brooks who is ciscos and melvins boss ninfuriated and insufferable paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping nduring his investigation cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader and paris orders his capture and execution nmelvin must now find a way to stay alive nby the way do you know how the investigation takes place nciscos partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing nbut mr nishi has a trace buster buster nto counter that ciscos partner has a trace buster buster buster nbut nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster nand so on nthere is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live nand there are lots of issues that wed like to know more about nhow does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee nwhat goes on among this clique nwhy is cisco at odds with melvin nthere is actually a lot of potential material that could have been explored but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction and instead we are given a notsoengrossing plot filled with oneliners silly sight gags extraneous subplots and tomfoolery nand i havent even mentioned his financees visiting parents who want them to separate nor melvins mistress nor the pimplefaced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on nif the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences then shoot me now n

this is one of the worst bigscreen film experiences ive had for a while nwith this film plus showgirls and basic instinct paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors nhis celebrated film total recall was i admit successfully scripted but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws nobviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven the result being that much of the special effects in starship seemed fake nbut not everything bad in the film was the directors fault even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors nit is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards i expected five for the acting categories ncasserole vanity devoid dense ribald dingy miasma and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school nno they have to pass primary school drama classes first nwhile total was written well starship is purely pathetic nall right it is supposed to be a fastpaced entertainment film and youre supposed to turn off your intellect completely and enjoy the action sequences and special effects that is guts and gore nas a matter of fact i found the activity incredibly boring a complete waste of more than two hours nhalf of the film was a bad episode of beverly hills 90210 dina meyer was in beverly hills while another quarter was simply nothing things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web and the rest was a display of humans fighting computergenerated images nthe battles were all the same jumping around shoot or get stabbed and on barren planets that only had giant insects nthere werent even any stunts which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around ni wonder what the insects eat if theres nothing but them on the planets nthere is so much laughable treatment in this film and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended nthis type of story is obviously aimed at 10yearolds who cant see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality nbut then there are always 16yearolds who have that frame of mind nthe pointless plot begins when johnnys vanity devoid girlfriend carmen richards decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth njohnny then signs up as a trooper also after an overacted argument with his parents nbut there is another girl dizzy meyer who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen which results in a love quadrangle which isnt better because it means augmented worsethanstereotyped soap opera increased bitchiness and more bad beverly hills melrose nand the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid nanyway getting back to the thing you might call plot johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry while his girl and the other dude are in the same league ndizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also nthey then start training which contains what roger ebert calls ips idiot plot syndrome moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes then real combat nand guess what nthats about as complex as it gets noh and one of their friends carl neil patrick harris a k a doogie howser m d becomes involved in war intelligence and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it nhes my fifth nom for a razzie nthe troopers fight fall in love die kill and try to act nnaturally they win or sort of halfwin nof course in between and at the end there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs nthe bugs also suffer from ips why would you release hold of your captive before killing it nisnt it also amazing that earthlings havent invented better handheld weapons by then nthe only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero nwell maybe aquarter of a star for the originality of the cosex shower scene and the very brief moments of suspense another quarter for copying zulu and letting the good guys the bugs win and half a star for the suckingout of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors but there should have been more the troopers deserved to die n

bicentennial man is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment nchris columbus the director who gave you mrs doubtfire plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point nbased on the short story by isaac asimov it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human which as you can imagine is very difficult nstarting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children nsoon this robot called andrew robin williams shows abilities that makes his owner mr martin sam neill very curious nandrew is interested in art and music he enjoys making clocks which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions nit shows out that because of a small failure in the electrical circuits and positronic brain andrew has accidentally gained a soul nthis makes him unique and his evil creators worried nthen mr martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasnt programmed to do nsoon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom destiny and love nthis film can be described as a disney version of blade runner a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction never since that film the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy nwhat makes us human nthe thoughts nthe emotions nis it possible to become human nat what point can we say to a robot now you are one of us nthese are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach nit is obvious that columbus didnt take them very seriously nwhen you think about it this film is not really meditating on the question when is a robot no longer a machine but a human being but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding nandrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being and only the society has troubles with it nin other words it is as far from reality as from the academy awards nfurther more there are other annoying problems nto this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now nthis has not been done for obvious reasons because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task ncolumbus is the first to have crossed that line nthe result is as you might imagine primitive unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort nthe world is simply frozen in time nneither the society fashion culture or values have changed over 200 years nmom is still working at the kitchen doing the dishes nwhen you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today youll see a slightly bigger difference ni am not saying that everything should change nit is unlikely that the human rights will change but its even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science technology and fashion ni suppose its possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale but its really hard nrobin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way nas always he does a decent job as does sam neill nbut it doesnt really matter nit is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience npretty much like last years meet joe black this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesnt deserve ngreat actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten nwhen isaac asimov wrote this story the future seemed far away and magical neverything seemed possible nnow is the future of asimovs time and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago nfor the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius vernes 20 000 leagues under the sea so cant we accept this story as a potential reality nlet us hope that next years a i nwill be more rewarding n
the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence nits not abhorrent or even blatantly unlikable but it doesnt make a shred of sense nand whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film njames foley knows a lot about characters and acting and those are the strengths of the corruptor nbut the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train nat least we have chow yunfat in the lead role nchow plays nick chen a chinatown cop nhes a good cop as the first few scenes establish and hes very familiar with chinatown nthats probably why the powersthatbe decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace mark wahlberg nnick and danny begin by stepping on each others toes but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other ones life nwhat happens after that is kind of a mystery to me nim fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu byron mann nim also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ric young a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff nim not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny although this makes for some ridiculous albeit unpredictable plot twists along the way ntheres also an interesting subplot revolving around dannys father brian cox but it doesnt have much to do with the main story none of the problems as i said is that the movie doesnt make any sense ni dont blame this entirely on foley because hes obviously a good director nim more inclined to point my finger at robert puccis script which doesnt seem to be in tune to the way normal people act none scene early on had me particularly annoyed nick confronts his boss because hes angry about his new white partner nhes shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me n in addition the film takes a bite into racerelated issues and never develops them at all nthere are a lot of scenes like this one and none of them are very coherent ntheres also a considerable language barrier given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents nthe plot itself never straightens out nim not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are or why henry lee is associated with them or what they do as a group nthe corruptor is an action movie and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences nthe sequences arent bad but theyre not new how many car chases through chinatown have you seen non that note how many chinatown cop movies have you seen none too many id imagine nfoleys strength is clearly in characterization and he does a pretty good job here nthe scenes between nick and danny are very good and i actually got a feel for their characters a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together nchow and wahlberg are both good actors chow is a pro and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep nwahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere but hes still fun to watch ni also liked the subplot involving dannys father brian coxs performance is powerful and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny nbut the film ultimately fails mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overlyfamiliar action scenes na complicated plot can be successful but the story needs to make sense when its over nthe corruptor never manages to make any sense it just keeps spinning out of control until finally theres nothing left to hold on to n

dont let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare nno one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work and this movie makes a vain attempt at that nany moves to glamorise his life which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness nthis movie about his life although well written puts too much makeup on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes rather than lobster and champagne noh well lets fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious playwrite who falls in love with a beautiful woman gwyneth paltrow and from her inspiration several plays develop romeo and juliet and the twelfth night nit is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and thats how all his plays develop but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama nbut i guess my version probably wouldnt draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen nso is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul ni think not nas for the oscars were they deserved by this movie ni think not nin many aspects private ryan and life is beautiful were far superior movies but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar as time and again for reasons unexplained an undeserving movie will win the accolade nanother sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead over a more polished cate but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised people will start feeling sorry for you n

 spawn may be somewhat of an older film nin fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasnt seen it will finally get to see it that is if they see it nbut i managed to catch it before it made its way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and god forbid video cassette purchasing nit wasnt the worst film of year by any means nit isnt even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year nbut it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten which in simpler terms means it comes in at number 6 on my worst of 1997 list nthe only reason it doesnt come in lower is thanks to the special effects which might actually have been some of the best of the year nperformances however were either wooden or for the most part unforgivingly campy nin fact this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness neven the editing seemed to boast a campy quality ni dont know how to explain that one it wasnt exactly choppy but something about it seemed n n nwell annoyingly unprofessional njohn leguizamo almost makes it as clown but not quite nhe is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional nbut the main problem i found with spawn as with most films that wind up on my worst of lists is that it was just plain boring ni wouldnt even say there was a climax to the film nsure it had the big battle scene at the end but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion nnever too soon the movie did conclude in a very simple disappointing way neven though its one of the shorter movies ive seen this year its one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again nlike i said the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride no matter how small ni was impressed with the opening sequence so long as i didnt allow the melodramatic voiceover and lobotomizing editing to get to me nand batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawns outfit created nbut even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes which looked quite a bit like a modern video game nwho knows if spawn the video game wasnt part of the plan from the beginning nkeeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable and in a very small amount makes up for the cheeziness of it all nbut none of this movies saving graces can it make it something id recommend seeing no matter what the price of admission nthis movie is definitely not for young children which shouldnt really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers if anyone would likely find it appealing nif you really want to catch a movie there are many better ones out there no matter what your tastes might be ntrust me n spawn has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers n
the previews for the movie are pretty good nthey show a little plot all the characters and the emotional highlights all spliced together to give a general impression of the script nunfortunately the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes nthe residents of mystery love hockey nmystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football nthe townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player whos guilty of shooting another man yes thats one of the movies jokes nevery saturday the best players pair off for a game and the whole town comes to watch nthe towns prodigal son charlie hank azaria wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated nmysterys national fame has the town abuzz na week later charlie actually shows up in person and he brings with him an offer from the nhl nthe new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals nthe mysterians see this as both good and bad non the one hand theyd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition non the other hand they dont want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes nthe movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition nbiebe russell crowe has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys including his new replacement nhes already resentful and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife ncrowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film so hes just kind of stuck with constantly brooding ncharlie meanwhile is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a mans worth nhis gift of the feature story and of the new york rangers was his way of compensating for not being a better skater nhe hoped it would earn him some respect and merit but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him nburt reynolds could have been interesting as walter the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans nwalter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey but he actively tries to put it behind him nhe wants his son to take the game more seriously but he wants his community to just get over it nreynolds could have been good but sloppy writing andor editing keep walter in the corner and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together none character actually was interesting nbiebes wife mary mccormack like the judge understood that there was more to life than hockey nbut unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community nshe chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open nher unique insight is verbalized once and it lasts only a scene before it is gone but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom nmysterty alaska follows a handful of other characters but none are well developed or worth mentioning nthe biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story no underlying thing that the movie is really about ninstead roach and screenwriters david e kelley and sean obyrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy nthey try to make you laugh and cry to feel outrage and pride nthey present the framing and cadence for jokes but theres nothing truly funny nthey show appropriately staged scenes of sadness but they give you nothing to be really sad about nas columnist molly ivins would say its all hat no cattle nthe perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about nthere is a funeral scene played with appropriate gravity and somber music nit is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide whats truly important nrussell crowe steps forward to speak about to spell out the movies metaphor for us nhe says that what really matters in life is community nthen adds and hockey ni guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear nonly mildly bad mystery alaska probably deserves 2 stars ni even laughed out loud genuine laughs in places nbut i docked it an extra half star when mike myers a friend of roach turned up in a role that didnt suit him nmyers is a comic character actor nhe puts on masks becomes an outrageous caricature and is funny nhes great as austin powers dr evil or any of his scottish characters nnobody else in mysterty alaska is a comic caricature nall the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semiserious roles nfor roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast toward his audience and indeed toward the film itself nits an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously n
i looked at the internet movie database s awards section for this film and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for best picture drama nanyone whos seen this film can back me up on this this is the worst of the great disaster films and thats not really saying a lot for this film n earthquake is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured non video its a bland and slowmoving film which gives us a bunch of different characters the disaster film requisite then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster nwhile this worked in say the towering inferno it doesnt here for one single reason we dont care about any of the characters nthe film gives us charlton heston in one of many crap 70s films he made including skyjacked and that classic soylent green as a rich man married to ava gardner who is having a little affair with a young single mom genieveve bujold a renegade police officer on suspension george kennedy in his least humored performance in the second weirdest subplot a motorcycle stuntman richard roundtree right after his shaft thing whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down yea snore and the weirdest subplot a military manbag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair nin smaller subplots theres a pointless bit about people who are flying over l a the city in the film by the way one whos playing cards and married to a boring nonacting husband you think this one can go nowhere nguess again he gets interested in the final frames theres genieveve bujolds moron son who has a little adventure with wires and for some muchneeded comedy theres walter matthau billed as walter mutha n the only laugh in the film as a wild drunkard whos big moment is a dance he does at a critical time nas for the actual earthquake its rather a letdown ntheres a full hour of charactersetups none of which is interesting then about 10 minutes of shaking crumbling and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold narrowly missing nthis film needed that whole theatreshaking they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored ntheres little suspense following the quake although this film tries for it ntheres an adventure in a crumbling highrise office building the wires with the kid and the movement of people who are all injured nbut none of these are alltoo suspenseful nthe finale with the hestongardnerbujold love triangle is ended in a basic flipofthecoin bit which brings out a big letdown nand theres no real finale neven volcano ended nicely and that movie really sucked nnot only is it hokey but you dont care about any character nwho cares if heston dies nwho cares if he choses bujold or gardner although i would have chosen gardner mainly on the basis that she can actually act nwho cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid stunt nwho cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires nand who cares about that whole plane spiel nif anything earthquake is worth a viewing for the same reason glen or glenda nis ni mean i laughed at this more than i did at bio dome nbut thats another story and review nin short earthquake gives disaster pics a bad name n
 the following review contains some harsh language nbut what did you expect when you clicked on this title n ncast kristen holly smith danica sheridan alex boling michael dotson sonya hensley janet krajeski sabrina lu dionysius burbano calvin grant jeff b harmon written and directed by jeff b harmon running time 97 minutes n the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside n blatz balinski danica sheridan laments the fact that her lesbian lover april kristen holly smith has just received a telegram from her exfiance nisle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot smith a resident of the small town of bumfuck arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson michael dotson nwhen april gets extreme cold feet she runs home sticks a gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger ninstead of killing herself she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed except for lance the homosexual toilet cleanerslave napril loves her new home and friends but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up nmr and ms pfferpot director jeff b harmon and janet krajeski decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr sigmoid colon also jeff b harmon who claims he can cure homosexuality nin actuality dr colon is homosexual as well and begins his special treatment on dick dickson unbeknownst to dick nwhen april turns down dicks demand for her to return to bumfuck he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambostyle ninstead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance alex boling and the two of them along with april and her lover blatz get married n note to the filmmaker why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that im assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided naprils parents feeling like there is no recourse call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer their way nthe bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the circuitry and they rewire it and send it back to washington d c destroying it nmr and ms pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own nim not sure if writerdirectorcostar jeff b harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs neither way he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie nthe film opens with a preacher running a small africanamerican child out of town and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan during a jaunty musical number preceded by remarks about gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others such as the jews nif harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i cant help but feel like he had some serious intent nas for the entire central theme of the movie im afraid that its one that i just dont get ni tried to keep an open mind while watching it but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes nit was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society nhow does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of nonacceptance nim not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society but dont force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you arent going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me nagain maybe im missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make but if so i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully nas far as musical comedies go isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy ndespite the disturbing visuals mom and apple pie stuck with me for the rest of the day nspeaking of disturbing visuals wedding bells aint ringing could have been a decent song but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying n im a lesbian which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular is also pretty good but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms smith nits mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based nthe other performers are decent save for the rosie odonnell like performance given by danica sheridan ni have no inherent problem with her character it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired none particular musical number lesbian rock was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my filmgoing life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan nthe film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll nthe remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs lesbian rock included and the ridiculously presented antinukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film nonce the isle of lesbos reprise was reached i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all nwhy was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end nisle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www indieunderground com nthe transfer is pretty clean and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 85 1 nin many respects isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential like a rocky horror for the new millennium nthis film is by no means my cup of tea but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it nif you think it might be for you then by all means seek it out ni on the other hand will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator nwait arent gladiator films considered to be noh never mind n
im not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing disturbing behavior with scream nmaybe its because theyre both horror films kinda both have hot young stars both have an annoying alternative soundtrack and both are aimed at the teenage crowd which i guess includes me nbut this is not the next in line with the scream flicks as well as the i know what you did last summer soon to be flicks nit owes less to halloween and more to kafka and orwell which in my book makes for a more interesting feature nand it should have been nthis is basically a rehash of the stepford wives the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing as ive been told with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives nor something like that n behavior starring katie holmes of dawsons creek deals with a bunch of teenagers deep in angst who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers nsuckups npreppies nit actually at least to me sounds like it would work and with scott rosenberg that witty penmen who has written stuff like beautiful girls and things to do in denver when youre dead as well as con air it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit nalas its not and it plumets into that little group of movies known as the movies with potential that blow it ni remember a film called white mans burden which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with its potentially brilliant premise nheres another one nit could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves nits a stage and this film does in fact realize that nit gets its message across and it does it effortlessly nnow it just needs to work as a film nwhich it doesnt nits too sloppy and too contrived nit paints a bleak portrait of high school life then nlets it lie nit brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kissups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes then ngives it a cheap twist when they get horny they become homicidal nisnt it scary enough that theyre like this and cant the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them not that you could be next to die nthe film introduces us two three different characters who in the beginning are considered outsiders because theyre not yet part of this clique the new kid steve james marsden dull dull dull dull whos having trouble at home because he hasnt gotten over his brothers ethan embry in quick flashes so you dont recognize him i did suicide the renegade girl rachel katie holmes from dawsons creek whos chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring and by far the most interesting kid gavin nick stahl the kid from the man without a face whos the most interesting because hes the only character whos given some dimension nin the films best scene he introduces steve to every single clique nailing each ones fetishes and hangups and its the best scene in the movie because its witty satirical and interesting something the rest of this film isnt ngavin suspects theres something awry with the preppie kids known as the blue ribbons and in the tradition of all conspirators and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve hes only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff nhere we have another case of the idiot plot where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him but he may have saved this film from being the dreary dull film that it is without gavin who gives it life and humor nthe only other halfinteresting character is the school janitor played by william sadler as a retarded scary guy who may not be what he seems to be but nreally we dont care anyway ni probably shouldnt mention that this was directed by david nutter whos works for the xfiles because that would probably tarnish his reputation nlike the show hes good at setting up weird conspiracies and creating a general creepy feel nmost of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect and some of it works nbut what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff nhe keeps too much inside so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act you wonder why they just dont get the hell out of there ni think what happens to gavin is proof enough that theres something rotten in the state of teen angstdom nwhat this film needs to be is a lot longer a lot more colorful and a lot creepier nif the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor played by bruce greenwood an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed then they need to come up with a tougher smarter villain nif hes so villainous then why could two dense teenagers who couldnt figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes nthe film which runs about 80 or so minutes just needs to work on these things and become a lot less sloppy nat such a short running time and with such lame boring characters as these its pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in ones mouth especially mine n
 holy man boasts a sweet gentle comic performance from an unusually subdued eddie murphy and a few moderately funny skits nunfortunately to get to the good stuff you have to sit through a painfully long setup loads of tedious filler interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering and twitching a superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggias career nif ever a movie screamed wait for video so you can fastforward through all the dull and annoying parts this is it neddie murphy plays g a robed nomadic pilgrim wandering the land enjoying the moment and spreading his spiritual message na chance meeting with ricky hayman goldblum a stressedout executive of a homeshopping channel and kate newell kelly preston a nononsense media analyst results in physical injury to g quicker than you can say the odd couple g ends up rooming with an extremely leery ricky nafter some script gymnastics g appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations enraging network owner mr mcbainbridge loggia and becoming a national media sensation n holy man attempts to be several things at once nit tries to satirize home shopping networks but its difficult to effectively make fun of something that is already a selfparody nthe film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions is merely a futile attempt to fill the spiritual holes in our hearts but thats common knowledge already n holy man also tries to present a story of redemption as ricky hayman tries to decide whether to exploit gs good will to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his career nanyone want to place a wager on his final decision nthe one genuine asset in holy man is eddie murphy who gives a charming performance sharing love good will and relevant advice to all those around him while beaming his million dollar smile at just the right moments nmurphy is delightful and the film takes off whenever hes onscreen nunfortunately hes not onscreen enough njeff goldblum gets the lions share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down nas his potential love interest kelly preston tries to brighten things up but she transforms from an allbusiness media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance nthe other principal actor robert loggia wastes his talents in a onenote turn as a ruthless screaming monster nstructurally unsound and way too long holy man is appealing when murphy is onscreen and dull when he isnt ninstead of dropping your money at the theater for this trifle wait until it hits video and fastforward past everything except the murphy scenes ng suggests that we focus on enjoying the moment and thats the best way to do so n

sometimes i wonder just what the censors are thinking ntake this film naked killer among its ingredients are heavy doses of violence rape sequences straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls coarse language nbut what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended none word penis nthats it nin spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is penis nit really restores youre faith in the system huh nanyway thats just a side point nwhen naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip cool controversial thriller nwhat they forgot to mention was that it isnt very good nthe plot involves male cop tinam simon yam investigating a series of brutal murders nwhile getting a haircut he meets and finds himself attracted to a girl named kitty chingmy yau who after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father falls in with professional killer sister cindy svenwara madoka nrealising kitty has potential cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her a new identity nhowever in the course of his investigation tinam who believed kitty had disappeared runs into her again but isnt quite sure if its her nto complicate matters the actual serial killlers princess and baby who a former students of cindy and have been told to kill their old master and her new student nfrom then the action ensues nall in all this is not a well done movie nthe script is awful the direction all over the place the editing is jerky and confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor nhowever the are a few stand alone pieces that do entertain nthe shoot out in the car park is almost woolike in adrenaline nthe fight scenes are energetic and i guess it must get a few points for trying something a little different nlet me put this way if you like action get something else if you like strong women in movies get something else if you have do decide between this and black cat for your hong kong female action dont get either neven for curiosity value it just isnt worth it nlets face it if ever the was a movie that became popular on its subject alone this is it n
in china in 1982 i turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america ni guess i was expecting some sort of political question ninstead i was dumfounded by what was most on his mind n in america do wives and their mothersinlaw get along well nhe assured me in china that they did but i am certain if that were true he would not have asked neven in china people seem to have problems relating to in laws nperhaps some of lifes most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage na man trying to relate to his new prospective inlaws and viceversa could be the basis of a very strong comedy nmeet the parents does not demonstrate that fact however ngreg focker played by ben stiller has been dating and in love with pam byrnes teri polo for ten months and is now ready to propose to her nhe will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbies family and to attend her sisters wedding nfrom the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes robert deniro and blythe danner nthrough no fault of his own the airline has lost gregs luggage nand he has to ask to borrow clothing nit is the beginning of a game of oneupmanship in which greg is nearly always onedown nas the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes ngreg is playing a game he does not understand in a league he is new to nbut perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his fatherinlaw nthis film had potential in its tale of oneupmanship nit has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiarone that has not been done overly frequently in films nbut the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived ntoo many coincidences in the story work against greg nthe script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky ncertainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him nthere is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy ncertainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written nthe main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniros performance ndeniro plays the suspicious and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can nthe little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities nbut we do not really see much of that digging nben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen nit is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen nbut her character has a basic conflict between a basic decency and her love for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with that nrandy newman has written a playful score nin the first few seconds of the film it does something creative i have never heard a film score do before nthere is a lot of source music that is popular music of the 1960s npresumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebodys imagination nhumor is subjective and some this film has been getting some favorable comment nbut this is a comedy that works only occasionally for me ni would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale n
capsule godawful comedy thats amazingly shabby and cutrate and rather bereft of laughs ni was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers international man of mystery ni desperately needed something to cheer me up or at least distract me so i could get a clear head nget some perspective neven dumb movies can do that for me sometimes ni tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery nmichael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a fiveminute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of propsstrategicallypositionedbetweennakedactorsandcamera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago nthe plot what little there is of it back in the swinging mod hep sixties i dont think im doing a disservice to the movies attempted early look and feel by describing it that way sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr evil nevil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later when powers was out of the picture npowers also had himself frozen and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with nthe basic gag that of powers total inability to cope with the nineties is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with nthe bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics james bond gags of which this movie has no end right down to the silly character names inept slapstick toilet humor and strategically placed props nthe movies amazingly bereft of ideas come to think of it with a couple of bright exceptions none is dr evils son there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group chaired by carrie fisher and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch its a visual gag hard to describe and hard to recommend seeing the movie for na lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie but its desperate rather than clever ninstead of skewering the whole thing its a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute nmyers himself is also desperate hes given an idea to play not a character nplus the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy albeit nineties agent are a waste of time ni wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her only to have her deck him one nwith a couple of exceptions the movie misses all of its own best moments nthe movie even looks cheesy and not in a good way i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hidef video or something so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes nthe whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap nmy definition of comedy is simply did it make me laugh nthe few times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing and wanting out nthe most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tysons shorts and sent it sailing n
brian de palma the director who bought us carrie dressed to kill and mission impossible is back and has bought all his technical expertise with him nsadly he forget to bring a good story and believable characters nnic cage plays rick santaro a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne sinise nan assassination takes place and santaro tries to peace together how it took place trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy nthe film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together nhowever the film doesnt keep the mystery for long and once the big secret is out concerning kevin dunne the film is at a dead end nalthough there are some fantastic shots by de palma including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film halfway through the film drops dead nthe problem is that de palma doesnt have a strong story or characters to work with nhe tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience and i quickly got bored nnic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters but its no use nthey are boring faceless and completely unlikeable nyes another problem with the film is that theres noone to root for nwere supposed to be on cages side because his character becomes nicer throughout the film nhowever his change is sadly unbelievable npoor gary sinises character is terrible who completely changes throughout the start the middle and the end in an appalling way nthe films use of flashback quickly gets boring nwhile clever and interesting the first few times it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go nthey certainly dont increase the tension or suspense of the movie nthere is small thread of suspense running through the film but it certainly doesnt make this film a powerhouse thriller rather just a slightly below average one nthe script is lousy and contrived the characters flat and two dimensional ncertainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller nthe most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential ntheres a good story buried in snake eyes its just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks nit also gives itself away far too quickly rather than leaving the big twist for the end nwhile the performances are intriguing especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy number cruncher wrapped up in the case theres no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance and unless youre a big fan of either cage or flash directing should be avoided na david wilcock review 1998 n you know for kids norville barnes n
 mission to mars is one of those annoying movies where in the middle of the movie you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie all five minutes of it n mission does give you payoff but when it does come its too little too late n mission has some good ideas but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery dimeadozen dialogue and spate of good actors wasted in cardboardcutout roles nim sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm nglances dont communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end nthe film spends an hour on this kind of stuff building to its climax na lot of it is a cliched glorification of family relationships marriage friendship unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap nthere are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film and i give it points for trying to stay true to the science i know trying is the key word here nthe sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching but as mentioned by then were so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over ngreat design good intentions but no cigar nif youre not a die hard scifi fx or jerry oconnell fan his character is the only one who has some semblance of character dont waste your eight bucks on this nand what the hell tim robbins died halfway through the movie in a stupid way too nthats just unforgiveable n

first troy beyer wrote the critically panned b a p s nnow she makes her directorial debut writing directing and starring in this subpar film about women talking about sex nthough not without redeeming qualities this film is bad nthe basic story follows three single friends jazz beyer lena randi ingerman and michelle paget brewster in their search for love njazz has an idea for a local talk show it would feature women talking about sex and dating nshe and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami nthe film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters nthe fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film nthere are several moments of bad acting corny dialogue and emotional overextension nin a lowbudget independent film from a firsttime director these faults can sometimes be forgiven if the screenplay is fresh and solid nthat is not the case here nthe script suffers from random plot developments nthere are four or five of these turns in the plot each one raising the question where did that come from nat one point a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother nwe are supposed to be moved but since the scene is completely unledup to we really dont care if she and her mother get along nweve never seen her mother before nwe never see her again nwho cares nwhats worse these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy nat another point a character announces that she cant have children napparently this is devastating nwe wouldnt know this because she never talked about having kids before but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her nthe scene feels like an afterthought its emotion manipulative and shallow nthese scenes grow worse and worse culminating in an absurd climax ntwo scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing none scene is a lovers spat between two minor characters nthe other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax nthinking on these scenes it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities nbut it does nfirst it is original nwe men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea nits something i dont think has been the subject of a film nsecond the interviews of the miami women are sincere ntaken together they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners nthe mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes but each tile is some womans real experience nneither the picture of women nor their picture of men is truly representative but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way nat some level the stereotypes that emerge can be called true ni can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their likes dislikes skills and thrills but on the whole its pretty bad nand that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting corny dialogue and emotional overextension nill give beyer one more strike and then shes out nrated r almost got an nc17 for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity n
how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres nisnt there a law or something nthis diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilbergs dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst nmouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flatout stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison nwriter adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill nthe plot for what its worth concerns two brothers nathan lane and an appalling lee evens who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father ndeciding to check out the longabandoned house they soon learn that its worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder nbut battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse happy with his rundown little abode and wanting it to stay that way nthe story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe nwhatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue terrible overacting and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury signifying nothing nthe script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is i hate that mouse noh cringe nthis is home alone all over again and ten times worse none touching scene early on is worth mentioning nwe follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall nhe jumps into a tiny bed pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone nits a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film na message to speilberg if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility then either give all concerned in mouse hunt a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors nthis kind of rubbish will just not do at all n
john boormans zardoz is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own nnot since the rampant bumblings of one edward d wood jr has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time nof course woods career can be explained by two things he had no money and he had no talent nboorman on the other hand cannot court such excuses to explain zardoz or his followup film the equally awful exorcist ii the heretic nboorman obviously had a sizable budget a matinee idol movie star sean connery in the lead role and although you wouldnt know it from this film boorman does indeed have talent nthis is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece deliverance 1972 as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama hope and glory 1987 the slightly overconceived arthurian epic excalibur 1981 and the fatherson jungle adventure the emerald forest 1985 nhis films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste nif boorman is anything hes ambitious and when he succeeds its in grand fashion nunfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman falls the resounding impact can be heard for miles around n zardoz is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies an obsession of boormans nhis screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even the wizard of oz a book which figures into the movies plot nbut despite all this reaching the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling nthe events take place in the distant year 2293 but there is little of the typical futuristic movieness to be found nin fact things seems to have moved backwards with people riding horses shooting oldstyle guns and living in large victorian mansions nits more middle ages than space age nthe world of zardoz is divided into two distinct hemispheres the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life nthese immortals never grow old they never engage in sexual activity they possess psychological powers and they live in a sort of quasiutopian marxist society where everyone is equal and everyone contributes equally to the society nhowever if one breaks the rules that person is punished by being aged so many years nif someone breaks the rules enough he or she is aged to the point of senility and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals none of the immortals arthur frayn niall buggy a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed nlike the wizard of oz he adopts a godlike status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head n this flying head is one of the movies opening images and its a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come ncalling himself zardoz frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they cant procreate and take up more resources nfrom inside his giant stone head zardoz bellows seriously laughinducting statements like the gun is good nthe penis is evil nthat line alone is worth the movies cult following none day an exterminator named zed sean connery sneaks into zardozs flying stone pushes frayn out and goes back to the vortex nonce there the immortals label him a brutal and study him like a lab rat taking great perverse care in exploring his sexuality which is a mystery to them nthey seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantilyclad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up ni say hilarious because that is exactly what zardoz is nit is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so he made this film with the straightest of faces although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward he didnt get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming njust looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper a mane of hair braided halfway down his back a wyatt earpstyle handlebar mustache and a pair of thighhigh patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker nboorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of deliverance which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would greenlight this effort nhe attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth 2001 whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in zardoz besides the inadvertent humor nsean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace nhe got exactly that in zardoz and its a wonder it didnt end his career nim sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements nis it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life nis it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing nor is it a social statement something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates nkarl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary ncome to think of it maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip npeople high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy n
the king and i a warner brothers animated musical feature recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king with obvious results nwhen anna miranda richardson a british schoolteacher travels to saim to educate the kings martin vidnovic children she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly and must say something to the greedy ruler nmeanwhile the kings prime minister ian richardson the stereotypical villain plots to overthrow the king taking the throne nthe last and most predictable main subplot deals with the kings son allen d hong and his love for a servant tuptim armi arabe and how he conflicts with his feelings and the ancient laws of saim nnot even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent as the king and is problems could fill the blank pages of a journal ni will only note the major difficulties for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail nthe screenplay written by arthur rankin peter bakalian jacqeline feather and david seidler which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory as every time the obnoxious king would shout etc etc etc i would cringe nliterally nspeaking of cringing i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking nbesides the repetitive dialogue from the king on the whole the songs seem out of place and unlike the lyrics are unmagical nthe sole song which is used cleverly is getting to know you which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors which they have never been exposed to nunlike disney animated features the king and is songs dont add to the film and are as uneffective as could be ntake the following scenario as an example as the sheer horror of the king and is music is at its worst nyoure being hunted by a dragon nwhat do you do nsing a happy song nmartin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion you hear the saying two negatives dont make a positive nbelieve it nwith the terrible dialogue that the king has along with his awful voice track the king is completely unbelievable only shows mild signs of any personality and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says etc etc etc more and more as the film progresses nno personality at the beginning of the movie none at the end nand where does this characters personality change nhey i thought anna was supposed to change him nisnt that the whole plot nthe prime ministers hideous sidekick darrell hammond brings his share of cringes as well oh no nanother one of his teeth fell out nhardyharhar nhe is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him nby the way this review is going you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films hence why i hate this movie because the king and i is a disgrace to animation nanimated films such as 1994s the lion king and 1998s the prince of egypt are among my favorite movies of all time nthe animation team does design their share of well animated settings so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds ni have not read the play or seen the oscar winning 1956 film adaption but from what i can tell the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play for the king and i is never magical nor interesting nif it wasnt for miranda richardson who voices anna with feeling the king and i could earn the title worst movie of the decade ninstead the king and i will just go down as among the years worst nthe bottom line avoid this movie at all costs nnot even young children the target audience in this film will enjoy it nnot the slightest bit n
my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one but in fact the third installment it was the first to gain a national theatrical release ni didnt see the first film until much later nso looking back the original didnt hold a lot of great memories for me since i didnt think too much of it when i initially saw it nwatching it now for a second time confirmed that its an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever nyou all know the story by now child murderer freddy krueger robert englund returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before nthis first installment does an adequate job with its low budget but theres some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story nplus the movies ending understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a hook for a sequel renders the rest of the film pointless nand does anyone understand what happens to nancys mother at the end of this film ndont get me wrong though nits not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics nmost horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is nhorror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly and a nightmare on elm street just doesnt cut it na nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video nit is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set nthe film is presented in both pan and scan and its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 78 1 although on the disc that comes in the box set only a widescreen transfer is provided nthe film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5 1 mix nalso included on the dvd is a fulllength audio commentary track with writerdirector wes craven stars john saxon and heather langenkamp and the films director of photography nother extras include the jump to a nightmare feature im sure you can figure that one out the usual cast and crew bios which are from the films original press release kit and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp and the films original theatrical trailer nsome dvdrom features are also included but since i dont have dvdrom capabilities i cant really get into that nthe commentary track is entertaining and informative but nothing spectacular nthe first thing of note is that its the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago nim not saying thats a negative thing just pointing it out neveryone seems enthusiastic about being there with the possible exception of john saxon who just doesnt say much at all nmost of the time youll forget hes even there neveryone else talks really quietly though for some reason as if because theyre commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible nthe bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series nalso included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film nhowever you can only access one easily nthe other is hidden in whats called the labyrinth which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created nbasically its an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage interviews etc somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film nfinding it though is both a chore and a bore nr n
absolute power the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff nit is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper none can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood nnot only is the plot unbelievable and contrived but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence ncontinually underestimating the audience the film gives us information we already know or dont even need ndetails essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two nightvision goggles in their car noddly enough the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities na masterful jewelthief played by clint eastwood witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire played by e g nmarshall nwhile robbing one of marshalls mansions he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault nthere through a twoway mirror he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay ntheir game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman nin self defense the woman grabs a letteropener and stabs the man in the elbow nshe raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men nthe man nhe is the president of the united states of america nwhere does the film go wrong nit cannot be the acting nclint eastwood ed harris and gene hackman as the president give typecast but decent performances nthe cinematography is sufficient wild and erratic during action sequences dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue neven the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thrillersuspense genre nthe fault clearly lies in the screenplay and the screenplay alone nwhile setting up a story about misuse of power about the true possessors of that power and about intrigue and doublecrossing it does not resolve it nnot one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax nrather the tense situations are left dangling at the end giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness nan example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant npolice officers are everywhere incognito of course nat the same time not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives nall three parties are unaware of each others presence nthis scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood who might suspect this is a trap will get himself out of this difficult position nhe will probably have a brilliant plan involving ingenious preparations nhowever when he arrives at the trap both hit men miss how convenient and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away nthe buildup of this scene took about ten minutes nten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap nthe scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds nparallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter nthe daughter blames her father for never being there for her because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere nof course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family nagain it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot nhowever trying is simply not enough nthe second story line should be subtle original and preferably unpredictable neverything this film is not nhow could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced nhow could eastwood who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven ever believe in a project like this one ni am sad to say that my respect for the actordirectorproducer has diminished substantially due to this film ndirector quentin tarantino once said i can make a good movie out of any bad script ndirector clint eastwood obviously cannot n
one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jeanluc godard film nafter all he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave nhe is also an esteemed film critic lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing nhowever his latest creation in praise of love is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year nthe abstract concept on which the film is based had merit to dissect love into the following four categories meeting physical passion quarrels and reconciliation nthese four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples young adult and elderly nit is edgars bruno putzulu selfappointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup to define a central idea its only when things are over that they make sense nwhether this project will end up a play film or opera remains undecided nthe thesis is simple enough that if played right it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone ninstead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes the next scene no more engaging than the last nonly once does any character utter something worthwhile but by the time it happens youre so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it nbut dont fret it will surface again nyou could easily sleep through whole sections of the film as some fellow critics did and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in not having missed anything worthwhile nbut you hold hope for some time nthe background music keeps you in a state of urgency and even suspense for the first few conversations nits only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope nand with speeches like i am thinking of something but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else how can you expect to hold anyones interest nto godards credit he certainly knows how to frame a scene nthe black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful nwatching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him nand if this film had anything poignant to say you would have which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities nthe environments be it city or country are impeccably captured in crisp detail but the script never complements them nunfortunately godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene nsometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words nthe second half is composed of nauseating hypercolor that often blurs the image nyou suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners nthe only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies nsteven spielberg is picked on in particular nwhile ill grant that this does happen and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage its still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood nit just goes to show an intelligent person isnt necessarily an admirable storyteller nthe days of breathless are no more n
my giant is two movies for the price of one but neither is worth the cost of admission even if you get in free nas lamely directed by michael lehmann the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book n without goliath david is just some punk throwing rocks nlanguidly paced throughout the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer the omen meanders toward its sad ending nsince its rarely funny or convincingly dramatic what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery nother than a few nice visuals theres nothing to recommend the picture nwith great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally to the original city slickers billy crystal has shown that hes more than the worlds best oscar host nhe does however have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last years fathers day and this years my giant none wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project nsurely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there nperhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success nor maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movies somber tone nthe most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day nthis onejoke movies single idea is to place reallife basketball player gheorghe muresan who stands seven and a half feet tall into as many visually striking situations as possible nsammy crystal an agent currently without clients is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max muresan nafter throwing out constant oneliners either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car nsammy decides to get serious seeing max as his meal ticket nand although he doesnt like it hes willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a halfdozen dwarfs n the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever nafter a series of missed opportunities the comedic part of the movie is over and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie nwe learn that maxs condition is terminal and he will soon die nto be fair the movie does contain a few good scenes all of which you can see in the trailers nlets hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie nmy giant runs too long even at just 1 37 nit is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up nmy son jeffrey and his friend matthew both 9 gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it nmatthew pointed out that it is not as good as it could have been or should have been n amen nhe went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle njeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was n
what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project nmost of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films njohn frankenheimer who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60s recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin nscreenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd nben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes neven charlize theron who i was convinced couldnt act did a decent job in cider house rules nwhen all of these bright stars come together one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining nafter coming out of the theater showing reindeer games disbelief was my first reaction then frustration nthe movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an allrookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining nthe acting is so pitiful and the script so dull i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are nit seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights nwe have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar nthe actors in that movie were having fun and from that the audience had fun nreindeer games is the complete opposite the actors dont seem to want to be their characters even danny trejo who will do practically anything doesnt look like he is enjoying himself causing the audience to quickly lose interest nevidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled boy this movie is horrible nand when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments nthe story follows a man rudy ben affleck who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick james frain nnick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman ashley charlize theron and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person nwhen nick is killed in a prison riot rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays nunfortunately ashleys brother gabriel gary sinise interferes with their relationship nthinking rudy is nick he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino which nick use to work at as a security guard nnow rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel nconfused nthe movie only gets more complex as it goes on until it gets way way too complex at its climax nbut reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour nthe hero commits a greedy selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley nsome hero nthe point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing a person for the audience to relate to or admire nwhen rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times nthe most irritating part of the film besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason nthe routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead nthe only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food nwhy he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me nwhy any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me n
 there will be another the ads for this sequel proclaimed and why not ntrue brandon lee is dead but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994s the crow anyway nthe idea of spinning artist james obarrs original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie taking its own righteous vengeance against the world ngiven that basic framework the story could move in any number of directions nof course it doesnt nstubbornly the crow city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film when lees eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death ni remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality nin flashback we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover and then we watch in realtime as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind nits loud and repetitive true a sadists delight but its also horrifying and fascinating ncity of angels gives us more of the same but less skillfully ntheres an audience guaranteed for a film like this although bad reviews and poor wordofmouth will likely ensure that it wont be much of a success nin fact miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings n ive never understood the reasoning behind this tactic since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow nso much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup nthis time ashe frenchaccented actor vincent perez is retrieved from his watery death he and his young son were shackled together shot and then thrown off a pier by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead nperez might have some screen presence if hes given something to do with himself but here hes simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face nat first hes shivery and frightened but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave nhes befriended by sarah mia kirshner presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film nkirshner so beguiling in exotica is here an exquisitely photographed blank ntattooed with angels wings sarah is just about as lovely as women come but she serves no purpose not even as seductress nthe gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah richard brooks but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop who plays a gaunt fellow named curve niggy all bones veins and drawl is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film nlike all good things here hes dispatched too soon and without much imagination nin the meantime were subjected to tedious glimpses of judahs compound where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in sm fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they werent distinctly secondhand neven the soundtrack is tired nmore than anything ive seen from hollywood lately city of angels smacks baldly of product its a movie with a lousy script but a great look ncritics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope but his work isnt that bad per se nhes got a good eye and some intriguing visual ideas if anything this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery nhis major stylistic failing is that he cant seem to direct an action scene and the quick nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie nbut as director he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasnt the performers who couldnt and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved nwho bought david s goyers anemic script anyway nthe producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference n

ok i admit iti find camp amusement with the spice girls nyes the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual identities they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of girl power nbut not even their guilty pleasure appeal isnt enough to carry their big screen debut a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world nthe film begins amusingly enough with a cheeky 007esque title sequence in which the british quintet scary melanie brown baby emma bunton sporty melanie chisolm ginger geri halliwell and posh victoria adams are introduced one by one to much to my surprise excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience as they croon the silky ballad too much a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film na few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film 1 the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at londons royal albert hall 2 a film producer george wendt and a screenwriter mark mckinney pitch various film ideas to the girls manager clifford richard e grant 3 a documentary film crew follows the girls 4 a pregnant mate naoki mori of the group rapidly approaches her due date and 5 a tabloid publisher barry humphries attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug richard obrien ncapped off by a live rendition of the girls bouncy hit say youll be there a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow right nwrong its all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches ni must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them much less a organized framework for all the wacky goingson nspice world jumps from vignette to vignette subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense at one minute having the girls meet with aliens no joke and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride nwhile a decent joke slips through the cracks here and thereduring a dance bootcamp scene the girls sing the lyric we know how we got this farstrength and courage and a wonderbra much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level nsome gags are just plain pointless such as roger moores recurring role as the mysterious chief who dispenses cryptic metaphorheavy advice to clifford nthe only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond nha ha nas weak as the script is i think theres one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie and that is the girls themselves nthe point is not that they cant act and for the record they really cant but that their individual personas which works as a gimmick over the span of a fourminute music video are too thin to survive outside of the truncated video bite mtv world nposh who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions comes off best by default because her persona rich bitch most easily translates into character in a film nbabys persona young innocent to a lesser extent also works but the remaining girls identities are a little harder to flesh out nthere really isnt much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often which is exactly what fuller and spiers do and after all what exactly entails being ginger or scary napparently just their wardrobes nspice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices signature hit wannabe nthe song is as grating as ever but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a muchneeded shot in the arm setting the stage for a wave of selfreferential humor stemmed from the screenwriters film ideas the film almost mirrors robert altmans the player in the way the film snails into itself nthis section of the film involving all manner of derringdo involving a speeding bus is perhaps its most effective but it also points up how all the other storylines the publisher the documentary crew lack a satisfactory payoff nspice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family and it will please the spice faithful nbut this sloppy enterprise surely wont win them any new fans which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states nonce the hype disappears spice world will likely serve as the the spices final hurrah in america n

i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film ni bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach nthrow in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof nwell have a hit on our hands nthe replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film a mishmash collage of onedimensional characters rampant stereotypes of cultures and races cliched emotional statements of purpose and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography nthe story is loosely based around the pro football players strike in 1987 and a ragtag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels nkeanu reeves stars as shane falco a hasbeen football college player looking for redemption ngene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers nrounding out the cast includes swingers jon favreau 7up pitchman orlando jones gruff owner jack warden and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters the drunken welshman the overweight sumo wrestler the black convict the violent cop and the dumb dumb cheerleaders nthis bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from dennys nthe usual things happen like clockwork nthe hero rises from the ashes of failure the team comes together in unity the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax nits also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks nhoward deutch who was behind the camera for two of the best films of 80s pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes nobviously the problem is that without a good script any director will fail in the end nsports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds the rise and fall of gallant heroes and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life nthe replacements offers none of this n
stephen please post if appropriate n mafia crime isnt a funny business by homer yen c 1998 non a particular night when i found myself having some free time i had a chance to either go to sleep early or to see mafia a spoof of mafia and crime films such as the godfather goodfellas and casino nat 84 minutes in length i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep nbut by my account i think that my laffometer only registered a few grins one giggle and maybe one chortle ni suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star lloyd bridges who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film n mafia nchronicles vincenzo cortinos lloyd bridges life nseparated from his family when he was young he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life nbut as fate would have it vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord nfollowing in his footsteps are his two sons joey billy burke and anthony jay mohr nlike all siblings in powerful crime families they squabble over power the future of the family fortune and women n mafia is cowritten by jim abrahams who also contributed to some gutbusting funny spoofs such as airplane and the naked gun nbut these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work nas i write this i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based ncrime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence nits a tough genre to parody ni was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say please as they decide which sector to take over but this opportunity was never explored nthere were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughterinlaw na gunman shoots him several times nthe impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him from the samba to disco to the macarena ni think that i just gave away the best part of the film noh well that just means that you can go to sleep a little earlier n
as far as mystery men is concerned the burning question is less is it really as bad as it looks from the trailer n the answer there is an unequivocal yes and more how in the name of sweet jesus did firsttime director kinka usher get such a firstrate cast to act in this muck n mystery men features greg kinnear as the heavilysponsored captain amazing and geoffrey rush as his arch nemesis singular casanova frankenstein na veritable police lineup of hot hollywood talent plays the superhero wannabes of the title who join forces to get c amazing out of a tight spot when c frankenstein puts the screws on champion city ntheres william h macy as the mildmannered shoveler hank azaria as the cutleryflinging blue raja no knives but a phony english accent thats just as sharp ben stiller as mr furious whose only power seems to be his ability to get hot under the collar janeane garofalo as a crazed bowler with her fathers skull interestingly preserved wes studi as a rhetoricspouting cowled avenger and kel mitchell as the token and adding insult to injury invisible nblack guy nbringing up the rear so to speak is paul reubens yes thats pee wee herman paul reubens as nwell lets just call him the gas man nthe production design is overblown the special effects are overdone and the script based on bob burdens dark horse comic book series is overbaked nthe appealing actors are uniformly good and stiller is even stellar but they cant begin to save mystery men its just one big mess nyoure better off renting the video and pressing fastforward to get to the funny bits ni believe i counted three n
when i was nine i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store nmasters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures they combined science fiction and fantasy had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read nof course the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history ngiven the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon not to mention its moderately successful spinoff shera princess of power it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together come with the result of trillions and make a liveaction masters movie nlets be blunt masters of the universe is a very bad movie nthe story is painfully dull and mindnumbingly cliched hands up who wouldnt guess heman and skeletor take their fight into the real world and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors dolph lundgren as heman for one or good actors james tolkan meg foster given such awful characters and dialogue that they cant help but seem terrible nit is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars nwe have the alien bounty hunters the desert skif technology stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that deja vu is too polite a term to use in describing it n blatant uninspired ripoff would appear more appropriate ntv fans might want to check out courtney cox monica in friends and robert duncan mcneill lt paris in star trek voyager very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either nso in the face of such mindless submediocrity is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all nyes there is none incredible good reason nhis name is frank langella nlangella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood appearing in countless films over the years nhere he plays skeletor the villain of the piece ndressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face he is one part darth vader one part emperor and two parts grim reaper ngiven this character langella falls right into it with style and precision nskeletor is believable interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right nmasters of the universe ni remember loving it when i was eleven nat twenty one its difficult to see why nbut as i said it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder nbesides this year marks the films 10th anniversary nwatch it with some friends for a good laugh and celebrate n

14 years ago national lampoon introduced us to a new family the griswolds nin 1983 the griswolds embarked on a crosscountry journey with the destination of wally world a worldrenowned theme park in california nwe laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured ntwo years later we watched again as they went to europe and four years after that we shared christmas with them nnow eight more years have passed and the laughs have done more than die ntheyve been cremated nvegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold the good intentioned but illfated father of two nthe premise is basically the same nclark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation this time to las vegas nhis wife ellen beverly dangelo and teenage kids rusty and audrey always played by different actors this time around by ethan embry and marisol nichols respectively join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick nof course a vacation movie wouldnt be complete without good ole eddie reprised by randy quaid the misfit cousin showing up at all the wrong times nthere isnt too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it nits really just a skit movie nthere are a couple of ways to define a skit movie which is not a real term as far as i know nthe first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours therefore coming off like a two hour skit nthe second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits each lasting about five minutes nvegas vacation comes off like the first na good example of the latter would be last years black sheep nthe problem with this format is that it becomes old fast and it doesnt really fit into a movie mold nin these cases a plot which is generally very thin is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags i e nhave a good vegas joke make a vegas movie nsuch is the case with this movies miniplots nclark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswolds money ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie shae dlyn as an exotic dancer nthe simple fact is this movie isnt funny nat first i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes but when the movie got rolling my interest suddenly stopped nchase plays clark griswold really well nhe made the character and he is the character ndangelo to be quite honest never was too impressive as ellen and this movie doesnt show any signs of redemption nas for the two new griswold kids the word blah comes to mind nthe vacation series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters the simple reason being that there is nothing to them ntheyre so generic youll expect the credits to read girl 1 as audrey griswold nvegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor nyes its true that vegas vacation isnt even close to being close to being as funny as the others which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart nfirst off why did they leave off the national lampoons heading on the title ni couldnt find any reasons why but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didnt want to be associated with such a lame film nthats saying a lot especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented loaded weapon 1 pcu etc if they expected this to be another hit you would assume theyd be proud to tack on the notorious header but for reasons only we can guess at like the movie sucking they didnt nthere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact nthe first three films in the vacation series were written by john hughes a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80s including mr nmom sixteen candles the breakfast club weird science pretty in pink ferris buellers day off planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck nwowzers nwhat a r sum nlooking at the names youd think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980s nwell thats not all nthis guy also brought us 90s hits including the home alone series the remake of 101 dalmatians dennis the menace and the current flubber nvegas vacation however didnt have john hughes behind it and the loss is very obvious nthis time around the script is in the hands of elisa bell whose only credits thus far include four madefortv movies nvegas vacation plays very much like one and it would actually work much better as a madefortv sequel nif this sounds like a wild idea its not nrevenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies and they seemed like it nvegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 00 a m nsunday morning movie but as a silver screen major motion picture its quite out of place nstephen kesslers jejune direction doesnt help things either nhe only makes the film even more tvmovieish neach consecutive vacation movie has suffered a drop in directing power nwe started the series off with harold ramis who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as cowriting ghostbusters nnot too bad nthen we had national lampoons european vacation being directed by amy heckerling who would go on to direct the hits look whos talking and clueless as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high nlastly we had national lampoons christmas vacation directed by jeremiah s chechik who went on to direct the charming benny joon nkessler so far has one title under his belt the short film birch street gym which received an oscar nomination in 1992 ngranted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film we can allow for some amateurish quality but instead we get a movie straight from the text book boring bland and deeply unoriginal nif you loved the vacation movies and i know some of us did there still isnt anything here worth seeing nif you loved them dont ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte nif you never did like the series why the need to confirm why n
 ladybugs is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees the pathetic team who beats the champs cross dressing and the presence of rodney dangerfield nthis picture doesnt play like a comedy for children so who is it aimed at nand why is it told like a 91minute sitcom instead of a feature film nrodney dangerfield stars as chester lee a total schmuck working at a huge corporation nhe obviously doesnt have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead which he does by volunteering to coach the companys girls soccer team nwhat a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie jackee know absolutely nothing about the game and the players seem to know even less ni didnt laugh but for some reason it didnt annoy me that much nchesters fiancee bess graff thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams njonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team what original story ideas nwhat we get is just another retread of the underdog sports team mixed with some cross dressing nunfortunately the film isnt smart enough to play upon the drag aspect nin fact it downplays it so heavily its totally unbelievable ncould it be any more obvious martha is a boy nhe only wears a girls wig without any makeup and they dont even give him falsies nbrandis doesnt bother to mimic a girls voice either nthen there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress but for what reason nmartha is only seen on the soccer field why would they buy a dress for her njust when we think the martha character is going to be useful she disappears and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on nwhen bess discovers whats really going on she breaks up with chester and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss nthis film couldve been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary and bad at that ntheres just too much of a sitcom feel here especially during the socalled serious moments and all the confusion between the characters nive seen worse movies than ladybugs but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm so even when it turns sour it doesnt seem as bad as it is ndangerfield finally gets his respect in the end but at what a price n
well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task nhe has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films nin a domain that he owns it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one neraser back in 1996 was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense nbatman and robin in 1997 was the black sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting idiotic action scenes and painfully flashy costumes nnow in 1999 end of days not the end of days is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold nis this the end of a powerful action stars longlived career nwill arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past terminator terminator 2 judgement day predator nor an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past commando red sonja true lies nit doesnt look that way n end of days begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably due to the formation of the stars on that night will be the carrier of satans baby the hour before new years of 2000 nfortunately for the movies sake the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers subway trains in dark tunnels and a myriad of inept nypd officers nits an action films dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up nimagine if the girl had lived in anytown usa where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen and a post office narnold schwarzenegger jericho cane in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church who is trying to hide the girl or in some cases trying to kill her and satan gabriel byrne who is trying to make her pregnant nif the devil is successful the world will no longer exist as we know it njericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1 he once had faith but no longer does and 2 his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it njericho cane is your cliched bythenumbers hero right up to his name narnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can nhe shouts at everyone from cops to priests to the devil nin one truly hilarious scene which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point jericho screams to the devil you are a nchoir boy nyou are a choir boy nthose two lines marked the high points of this film na movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor n end of days fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne nbyrne playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie nhe wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time nthe annoying thing about his character however is that he has the power to kill any human with a simple punch in the face yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho ni can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody nthe other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances nkevin pollak who plays the partner and close friend of jericho is the supposedly funny character in the film every action movie has one nthe one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line nrobin tunney plays the chosen mother of satans baby with extreme annoyance nshe gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter or any of the viewers in the audience nin one unnecessary scene tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off nis this her job in the film nthe actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible nyou can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does nthis little prediction game is a very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of a movie nin a last attempt to make this movie good special effects are used to try to entertain the audience nbut without a memorable action scene in the whole film the director has not done his job successfully nthis film would have gotten a c if arnold stood in front of a camera and shouted you are a nchoir boy nfor two hours n
theres a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book screenwriting made easy nthis is funny the first time just cause it is but funnier as the film goes on since its totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it outlined it and then wrote this film nits like they took the subgenre of the disaster pic which can be fun and hokey at the same time and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them the stupid eccentric characters nyes the poseidon adventure is crap but its fun cause of all the stupid eccentric characters nand earthquake my god n earthquake has got to be one of the worst movies of all time but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold n volcano takes a semiintriguing yet stupendously inane plot a volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops only nits in dare i say it nl a and then puts no stupid stereotypical eccentric characters in it ntheyre just stupid nand the actors are all good ones ntommy lee jones is great an oscar winner and a member of the men in black my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer nanne heche is a good indy actress ndon cheadle stole the disappointing devil in a blue dress from denzels feet nand gabys one of the few good teenage actors nbut they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at whats going on nthey do their best god bless them but theyre all lost in the fake magma only don cheadle gets an interesting part and hes the greatest part of the film ntheres no real suspense here cause you dont care about anyone ni actually was rooting for gabys character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldnt have to keep saving her he did it like thirty times nand there are no interesting sites in l a that we see get destroyed npart of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever nin independence day the best part other than judd hirsch was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens nthat was cool nwatching really fakelooking magma plow down the street is not nokay so the films not devoid of merit nas i already stated don cheadle was great and the cast does their best nand theres this really moronic scene which looks cool njohn carrol lynch norm from fargo goes on a subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it nhe has one guy whos wounded and could make it nhe could throw the guy and jump and still survive nbut no nhe has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava nheres the cool sight he melts nheres the dumb part of it he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting ncool sight nno logic nbut cool sight nthe volcano erupts twice and for some reason the film ends there nthey arent worried about it eruting again they just go home to their toppled homes nbut to tell the truth i was glad they didnt go on ni was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended nmy god it was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film ni havent seen dantes peak but ive heard its a masterpiece compared to this nif you want to see a cool disaster flick thats inane but interesting rent the towering inferno with steve mcqueen paul newman and the schweppervescent o j nsimpson he saves a cat nif you want to waste your time watching a boring stupid disaster flick literally it almost grossed half of its budget see this nbut i warned you n
what were they thinking nnostalgia for the seventies is bad enough but do we really need an eighties film nrobbie hart adam sandler used to want to be a rock and roll star but in 1985 hes singing at weddings and having a good time na romantic at heart he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his highschool sweetie nwhen she leaves him waiting at the altar his tune changes to love stinks nhe meets waitress julia drew barrymore who is engaged to a junkbonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together nin fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie nsandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role but there is no spark nbarrymore doesnt seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it beauty but no attitude nboth characters are just there nbit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show nthe eighties are shoved in our face nreferences to deloreans madonna dallas ivana and donald burt and loni and miami vice get old fast nthe filmmakers must have realized that there wasnt much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions ntheyre not funny and it doesnt work nwith change on all fronts accelerating more and more nostalgia appears to have a great appeal but dont you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past nmaybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino n michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be n
jeanclaude van damme movies tend to be if nothing else a lot of mindless fun nhis latest film knock off skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is well simply mindless nyou cant really blame van damme nno one i suspect has ever expected the muscles from brussels to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray nand even his sidekick costar saturday night live alumnus rob makin copies schneider does whats expected of him although neither appear to want the role of straight man nno the problem with the film is its direction nthe first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible nand it goes downhill from there nfive hundred characters it seems are introduced within the first fifteen minutes nvan damme doesnt land his first kick until after thirtytoo late for most action fansand by the time the hour mark has rolled around your jaw will be on your cup holder and youll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess ndirector hark tsui whose previous film was the van dammedennis rodman teamed double team films at such a frenetic pace that its hard to know whats going on whos on whose side and what the point of all this is nfaster than you can yell fruit stand nwere watching a crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme nwhen schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with a fourfoot eel while enthusing move your beautiful big ass the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bizarre nevery now and again knock off will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishesinventive camera shots and angles wild rides down gun silencers and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below revealing cutins within the framebut they all happen too quickly and within such a furious frame of reference that theyre wasted nif only hark could have slowed things down just for a minute nif youre interested in the plot youre better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the onscreen shenanigans jeanclaude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with nanobombs hidden in cabbage patch knockoffs nmaybe nwith paul sorvino na more accurate summary would be jeanclaude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large blatant cocacola product placements nthe fact that the film is staged during hong kongs last days under british rule gets some lip service but doesnt figure in at all nperhaps knock off s most intriguing credit is that ron and russell mael composed the frenzied music score nsome of you might remember the mael brothers as the 80s synth pop duo sparks their contributions here are as confused as the accompanying action kimono my house indeed nlike the cheap jeans and pumma sneakers manufactured in hong kong van dammes latest is a real phony n
another formula feel good quirky comedy from the british isles much like waking ned devine and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line nit is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town such as tolerant vicars and policemen plenty of eccentrics and of locals who stick together through thick and thin nthe strength of this film lies in its rational theme that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol nthe film is tolerable until after its first hour it then falls completely apart becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas nbut its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to at least be viewed as containing a pertinent message nits message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the war on drugs is about to be escalated into colombia nthe drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future it has so far just ended up causing americas jails to be overcrowded with nonviolent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing americas drug usage and drug supply nbillions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war by backing a corrupt government remember vietnam with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam with this scenario closer to home so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war nthe films mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago is a theme long overdue for public acceptance but one that is better received late than never nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this rather than making it a police matter altogether nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middleaged woman grace brenda blethyn who fell out of an airplane evidently committing suicide nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up without her knowledge their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husbands enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london honey quick nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying is that when conferring with honey she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can the creditors swoop down on her like vultures nher gardener and handyman matthew ferguson decides to stay on with her despite his last check bouncing nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants which he grows for private use nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be highquality stuff nfor grace this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt for the scotsman matthew it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky valerie nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed the police sergeant campbell pretends not to notice what the bright lights in graces greenhouse is for the friendly vicar phillips counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you cant control and the doctor clunes enjoys smoking the weed for recreation nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a bigtime drug dealer instead of having matthew go because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesnt want matthew to end up in jail nit is interesting to note that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you only that one can go to jail nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london trying to find a drug dealer while dressed out of place in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole whereby it never recovered its dignity nthe film moves into the formula mode whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive as she meets an international drug dealer a frenchman tcheky karyo who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences thereby becoming a celebrity nthings work out in a ridiculous way where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded nthis unhip film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly but should be tolerated as something naughty middleaged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute nummm n
ill be the first to admit it nwhen you mention the book great expectations i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch nyes its a classic of literature but it was a rather dry one shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine ncertainly the experience wasnt truly that bad but to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book im not going to tell the story the way it happened ill ngonna tell it the way i remember it nanyway to return from nostalgia lane and get back to the present hollywood in its trendy attempt to modernize the classics now presents an updated film version of great expectations ninstead of pip this time the central character is named finn played as a boy by jeremy kissner and by ethan hawke as an adult nfinn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie or should that be mrs joe kim dickens and her boorish fisherman husband joe chris cooper nthe setting is the florida coast during the mid70s nfinn is a blooming artist and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish one of his two favorite subjects nduring one of these escapades he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal robert deniro nborrowing a page from the superhuman max cady deniros criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity and favors hiding on the ocean floor nok maybe nthats an exaggeration but he certainly beats any of houdinis records in the opening scenes of the film nand thats nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finns motorboat but i digress nanyway finn does the convict a good deed just to show that hes a really swell guy nand then the plot moves on nenter miss havisham or nms dinsmoor here anne bancroft nabandoned at the altar some 26 years ago ms dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid nwith bizarre clothing eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role nalthough she ends up nowhere near a believable character she does add some humor to the film njoe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner but the insane ms dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece estella raquel beaudene as a young girl gwyneth paltrow as an adult nfor no apparent reason other than to provide the main plot of the film finn is instantly stricken for the estella nperhaps its her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before nin any case neither as children nor adults chemistry simply doesnt exist between the two and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her neven when as an adult finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor reacquaints himself with estella and draws her portrait in the nude theres nothing nin fact there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnears gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets nat this point the audience has grown as cold and detached as estellas character and couldnt care less about the two characters nthe bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow nshe fails to imbue estella a remote character in the book with even the vaguest traces of humanity ntheres obviously something wrong when watching the film youre more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character nwithout a strong estella finns obsession seems baseless nyou wish he would just stop whining let estella marry his rival walter plane an oddly subdued hank azaria and just get on with his life nin fact the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot nfinns relationship with his brotherinlaw joe is interesting if a bit stereotypical nwhats more fascinating are his interactions with deniro nalthough its only a bit part it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create nit is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film nsome of the shots work but others are too obviously staged for example both of the water fountain scenes to have any impact nfinns art actually the creations of italian painter francesco clemente is used throughout the film but it mostly fails to have the intended effect nwe never see why finn would generate this style of art which is simultaneously crude and insightful nas a result it ends up as distant as the rest of the film nmodernizing the classics is currently in vogue just see william shakespeares romeojuliet nsimply update the action to a modern setting and apply plenty of modern rock nbut such adornments do little to perk up great expectations nas much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it youd probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film n
some movies i should just skip nmy daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back and here comes another disney effectsfilled liveaction flick based on an old tv program ntrue the probgram is only 15 years old this time and its a cartoon nbut its a cartoon i liked and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen nbut my daughter really wanted to go and how bad could it be nturns out i was right mostly ninspector gadget oddly enough follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian down to the jivetalking sidekick nat first i thought it was done by the same people but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver nthis odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it where formula isnt just business its a way of life nthe producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits nin some parts you can just hear them saying more zany ni want more zany here and here n lets have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here make it really painful ni want the audience squirming in their seats n ok thats fine but i want you to add bug guts n what does this scene do ncharacter depth nbut wheres the zaniness ni dont see zany here nif you cant make it zany cut it nthe latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie nmichelle who plays penny gadgets niece shines in every scene shes in but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time nmy guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor ndabney colemans comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby ni kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film but instead he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes nhe is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the gidget bitch from hell town mayor noteris overly enthusiastic and continually selfcongratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland oregons own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasnt poking fun at our fair town nor maybe all career politicians are like that ni must say matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla nhe appears to have some fun with the film especially as the evil gadget nrupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw njoely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself nher performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film nd l hughley plays the shuckinandjivin vehicular sidekick in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years nthe dialog is lets face it its pretty bad nthe tagline after a major setpiece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context na lot of the lines especially hughleys appear to be made up as they go along by people with little gift for adlib nabout threequarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw ngadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations not really battles with the evil gadget npenny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon nlet me rage here just for a minute nmichelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character nshes utterly charming and has excellent experience harriet the spy for the part of the pintsize detective nwhy she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery nthe film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting or editing stupidity ninspector gadget is missing the long long stretches of potty humor that among other things made my favorite martian so unbearable but its a very short movie so perhaps something was cut at the last moment nprobably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits nthe evil sidekick support group is especially worth seeing and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds its onscreen nall in all another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films ni wonder if disney uses the revenues for its generally moneymaking cartoons to produce these losers nbut if true why nif theyre trying for another mary poppins they need to find a team that can produce one and then give them a chance to do it n
the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole nand in the future its also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole nnaturally this is the setup for the other event horizon nthe movie nwhen the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at just outside of neptune the crew of the ship called the lewis and clark has to go to investigate and dr william weir the creator of the event horizon gets to come along for the ride nif youve glanced at a poster for this movie you know that supposedly what follows is infinite terror nwell i dont know about the terror part but infinite certainly seems to qualify nevent horizon is a meanspirited gory sick excuse for a film nit starts off as an alien ripoff and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes nat least for those first 40 minutes its an interesting ripoff of alien nthats a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie which seems to go on forever nit not a scary monster movie nor is it a psychological thriller nit is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore nyouve seen this kind of movie before nthe hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility nthis is a kind of movie for which i have no respect a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago nit is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore but event horizon takes the low road and the viewers pay the price nthere are many good respectable performances from fishburne and neill most noticably npaul andersons direction is impressive as it was in mortal kombat nthere are many nice special effects mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zerogravity nthe sets are beautiful to gaze upon nand richard t jones character cooper is hilarious and extremely likable more so than most characters ive seen in recent movies for the little screen time that he has nand none of this can save the movie from being a dgrade level of film nthe idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers is a promising one na haunted house story in space isnt such a bad idea nbut the final execution is extremely disappointing nthats not to say that philip eisner here making his feature filmwriting debut doesnt have talent nfor those first 40 minutes he manages to make a tired premise interesting adding in aspects of unique flavor into a ripoff story and thats something that not too many writers can do nhe even has one scene that though it also tries to sicken the audience has a honestly tense feel to it the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space nhe definitely has something of a gift but its not fully on display here ni certainly will look forward to seeing more from him and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise nbut because of what this movie degenerates into i have little or no respect and got little or no enjoyment out of it nif this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film then i agree with laurence fishburnes sentiment god help us n
after 1993s falling down i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a great director nsince then he has offered us two soso adaptations of john grisham novels the client and a time to kill and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise nalthough these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumachers potential the publicity for his latest release 8mm raised new hope nit promised to be something unusual nit wasnt nthe plot goes like this tom welles nicolas cage is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman allegorically named mrs christian myra carter to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husbands belongings nthe movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask who reminds me of bane in schumachers batman robin nbecause murders can be realistically simulated in movies mrs christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead nby combing through missing persons reports tom finds the girls name and tracks her to los angeles nwith the aid of max california joaquin phoenix a video store clerk and another symbolic name tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff nthe plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schraders hardcore in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter nboth films are modeled on dantes the inferno of course 8mm makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil n hardcore is a much more subtle and meaningful film n 8mm had a lot of promise nin its better moments its an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom none moment of the first sort when we first meet max hes reading truman capotes in cold blood underneath the cover of a porn novel n in cold blood was the father of the truecrime genre which is the literary equivalent of snuff films nmax promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom dance with the devil and the devil dont change the devil changes you ntom does changeill let you discover the specifics for yourselfbut not permanently nschumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didnt have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldnt come back n walkers seven did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise ncage tries hard to pull it off but the script doesnt give him enough to work with nphoenix walks away with the moviehes smart charming and funny nother cast members include fargo s peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and the sopranos s james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far nin the last analysis since 8mm falls short of its pretensions and its promise its just another private eye story in the raymond chandlerross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege nhowever unlike other predictable fare in the genrelast years twilight for example 8mm is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is n
my inner flag was at halfmast last year when nick at nite pulled dragnet reruns off the air nsure id seen them all at least once but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultraserious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv neven though dragnet is out of circulation at the moment we webb antifans still have the d i a 50s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous blue boy episode of dragnet nfor anyone like me who got laughs out of webbs rapidfire speeches and straightfaced seriousness think of the d i nas what would happen if sgt njoe friday ever enlisted because he plays exactly the same character here a nononsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long winded melodramatic speeches on any topic nin this election year im more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth nthe movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webbs office door and enters nhe gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up nthe produced and directed by jack webb card pretty much goes without saying nthis is his movie all the way and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason i was wondering if there would even be a plot ni certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants but the d i ngives us more much more nwebbs mission is to make a man out of private owens the local screwup nthe captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or the captain will personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself n whether the lace panties part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered nthis of course gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens life a living hell nfor those of you who havent been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching heres a reprint of a typical monologue of his ni cant duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper but the words should at least partially convey what im talking about n now you listen to me youngster nsomeday youll wake up fighting on a beach and youll pray to god somebody doesnt get killed because of your foolishness nive got a headline for you every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours youre gonna turn around and ill be standing right there ni couldnt write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d i n nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard days work by going to the local bar where he orders a tomato juice nhe meets a woman who coincidentally also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typicallystimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his archrival another marine d i nwebb marches over to the table gets up in her face and says just what kind of a dame do you think you are nbogart he aint nthe other d i ngets one of the few memorable nonwebb lines when he confesses to the girl hes a damn good d i n ni guess im just a little jealous njoin the club were all jealous of jack webbs way with women which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene as webb finds his way to the womans place of employment a lingerie store and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display n you expect me to talk to you nin here he exclaims no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras nthe woman goes off to help a customer leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen na little girl spots him in the store and demands what are you doing in here youre a man arent you nhe doesnt reply but you know hes thinking in his head what an odd species of human so small nmust be one of those children everyones been talking about nthis poor girl scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb would later swear off the male gender entirely just one of the many lesbian conversions hes responsible for nthe movie doesnt focus too closely on webbs romance it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills nafter two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea webb asks owens was that flea you killed a male or female nowens replies a male sir nwebb yells to the platoon this aint the one nthat such a scene along with the rest of the movie was intended to be taken seriously defies comment nbut we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d i but for iwo jima guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century nwebb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie with the exception of owens were played by actual marines nsomeone wanting to parody this movie couldnt do a more comical job than webb did nit makes it all the more ironic like raeeyain on your wedding day that the man had no sense of humor himself ntheres a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter nwebb bursts in the room and shouts what did i tell you about laughing nto which the private replies sir only nineyearold girls laugh sir nand let me tell you i was as happy as a nineyear old girl while watching this movie n
this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground despite some good performances from a basically competent cast neddie sean penn and maureen robin wright penn are a notsohappily married couple down on their luck nliving in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city they spend what little income they have at the local bar owned by shorty stanton eddies best friend and his wife georgie mazar nmaureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddies frequent disappearances non his return he promises her the world and professes his undying love ntheir manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows as eddie disappears again nlike a junky craving the next high maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high ntheir relationship is further complicated by maureens pregnancy nshe wants the baby and the father but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter nduring one of eddies absences maureen is attacked by kiefer her neighbor who gets her drunk with her cooperation and then insists on intimacy nshe leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do not to her but to kiefer nshe lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage nhe lashes out as she expects and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months but in reality is 10 years nduring this decade maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual joey travolta in a small role nher life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her njoey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband and father of two children and stability joey makes a good living drives a cadillac and they live in a large house in the suburbs and the love of her previous life nshe chooses her past and sacrifices not only her new life but her old by giving up her and eddies daughter to joey nbut the eddie that she knew is gone replaced by a mere shell of the man he was nmaureen is herself a mere shell more an automaton than a woman as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him nperhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness or maybe the lack of sadness together but the movies denouement was not convincing n
the catch phrase for disneys rocket man is one spoken by fred z randall harland williams the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes n it wasnt me he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others nwell when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is williams cant take all the blame but he sure cant justify himself with his own simple tag line either nfred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wideeyed at a poster of the earth nas a 30yearold fred hasnt grown up much but at least hes somewhat closer to his goal now designing astronaut software for nasa nwhen an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void n n nfred nyes although hes an obviously klutzy moron nasa doesnt think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program and time itself has ever known nfor the first part of the film we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park he laughs he screams but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than childs play nhis passive approach to the program eventually leads to many recordbreaking feats much to the dismay of cocky counterpart mission commander captain overbeck william sadler who once held the records noverbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet one being astronaut julie ford the stupids jessica lundy and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist nfrom here on out we are subjected to one lame gag after another dealing with snot laxatives and flatulence nyou know standard kid movie material nalmost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist williams is awful in his first starring role nwe get the feeling that if jerry lewis and peewee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring williams would be it nwhile hes not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany stupid comedy hes just as unlikeable nto say it more understandably jim carrey might annoy you more but this guy is even less funny nwhy nbecause while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role his performance is too understated and boring nclassic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy nstan laurel for example was so innocent in all his troublemaking that we were immediately fond of him npeter sellers as inspector clouseau was so selfassured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip it was humor at its best nwilliams on the other hand cant garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his antiglory nas for the rest of the cast including some bigger names in smaller roles beau bridges and shelley duvall nobody is worth watching whatsoever nthis is just another example of the fastfood equivalent of cinema massproduced less than mediocre over priced and hard to stomach ngiving it oneandahalf stars is extremely generous but even ill admit to laughing a few times nthe amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids laughter was something rarely heard even from the children ni must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didnt crack up over every little thing nthen again maybe they were asleep nsome people might think critics are harsh on kid movies claiming adults arent the targeted audience and therefore arent meant to and wont enjoy them nsadly its also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if its presented right na twohour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast which could easily do the same thing nand saying that a parents perspective isnt important is quite a poor theory to have when theyre the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place n
all right all right we get the point despite all similarities to the bestselling story speechless is not based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin nin fact the script was in development well before 1992 nstill the comparisons are inevitable until one realizes a critical difference nno its not that the speechless twosome are speech writers not campaign managers its that carville and matalins story is actually interesting nspeechless is a limp poorly structured wouldbe romantic comedy nspeechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign where kevin vallick michael keaton and julia mann geena davis meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep nwhat neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign kevin is a sitcom writer brought in to punch up the republican candidates speeches while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate nat first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship but eventually they let down their guard and become closer nbut there are plent of obstacles in the way including julias studreporter fiance christopher reeve and a series of stunts which continue to prove that alls fair in love and politics nthe standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that theyre crazy about each other nscreenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each others arms in the first fifteen minutes then developing the antagonism nits a noble attempt to shake things up but unfortunately it just doesnt work npart of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do but in speechless they already know theyre attracted to each other and were left with waiting for the campaign to end so theyll admit that they love each other already nthere is such a herkyjerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even kings sharp dialogue cant prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour ninconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton and with those performances most of their scenes together nthe problems begin with their initial courtship which does virtually nothing to establish julias character and merely establishes that kevin is a wiseass ndavis is radiantly beautiful and keaton is generally entertaining but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit nin a couple of scenes like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain they actually achieve some measure of connection nfor the most part however theyre just actors spouting lines nyou keep waiting for a little spark and it never happens nperhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechlesss politics nthe setting seems perfect for a high energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix but thats never the tone that underwood is going for nhe wants a warm fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaimans fluteandwind musical score and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background nit might as well have been a story about rival grocers and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be ni was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert kings previous screenplay the dana carvey flop clean slate so i had some hopes for speechless nbut while there is wit in the words this is a script which was probably much better on paper non screen its still paper thin n
writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard nharder than pouring concrete under the texas sun nharder than building a bridge over troubled waters nand incidentally a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review nthrillers are all variations on a theme nyou have a smart resourceful and powerful bad guy who has a goal he has to meet nyou have a noble and brave good guy who has to protect the innocent kill the bad guy and not get killed himself in the process nthe trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner nthis simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest high noon or silence of the lambs or big summer blockbusters like men in black the fugitive or air force one or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds event horizon kull the conqueror nis anyone else getting depressed here npoint is its not enough to follow the formula nyouve got to throw in something extra something good and new and better than the last version nsomething to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals nthis is a hard thing to do but it is absolutely necessary in every way nwithout that something extra whether its a great plot or a wellwritten screenplay or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs the movie fails nthats why the jackal with all its starpower with all its budget with all its hype gets a big fat f nbruce willis is the bad guy the jackal a legendary killer for hire nrichard gere is the good guy a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal nthe jackal is trying to kill someone ngere is trying to stop him nwill gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal n ill give you three guesses and the first two dont count nthere are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal no moment when you say to yourself i wonder what happens next nthe script for the jackal isnt ripped straight from todays headlines nits ripped off straight from an episode of millennium nthroughout the movie we learn what the jackals plans are and how he intends to accomplish them nno surprise nthe fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackals plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy ninstead we get two count em two scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackals plan just as if hes frank black or more likely just as if hes been handed a copy of the script nand we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight nits like geres character is psychic but neither he nor the fbi or the screenwriters seem to know it nand just like in millennium the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about whether or not they are important to what hes trying to do or not nwhats more in the last half of the movie the jackal supposedly a supersmart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake comes down with a major case of the stupids nas for the performances nbruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack which is a major achievement but not enough reason to see the movie nhis disguises are good but not as good or as interesting as val kilmers in the saint nrichard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance nsidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie not that his performance is bad or anything its not but it is sad that hollywood wont use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent shoot to kill sneakers nwriting a good plot and a good screenplay like i said is hard but it can be done nit wasnt done here nit is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones ndo not go see this movie nyoull only encourage the producers to make more just like it ninstead stay home and rent day of the jackal or in the line of fire or a fire safety video for crying out loud nanything other than the jackal which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other better movies n

it should have been a classic na great cast of respected supporting actors nan interesting premise of loser comic book characters nhowever mystery men proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 nthe jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals nthe number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise nthe script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laughoutloud joke and mediocre small jokes it failed miserably at being entertaining at all nthe jokes were not funny for a number of reasons nthey had been used a number of times before in previous films the best ones which were mediocre to begin with were ruined in the trailer and the expectation of laughing at clever unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film n mystery men might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business nbut with veterans doing this kind of junk it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought nthankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie nthe film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy nthe fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero captain amazing who has recently captured every evildoer in the city ncaptain amazing played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear because of his success in the past is worried that he will lose popularity nafter freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city geoffrey rush overacting just a bit too much to keep himself busy things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured nit is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day nby the time this section of the plot is finished the interest for what happens if you havent already figured it out is very low nthere are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention nthe first scene in the film which shows the wannabes trying to save the day feels like it was seriously edited down nright when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folks home by some masked goons captain amazing comes in and saves the day or ruins the movie ninstead of editing this scene more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr furious ben stiller and monica a waitress claire forlani or the vast majority of the film which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was na simple rule more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work nanother major problem with mystery men is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances nthe film depended on its cast to work fluently together like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion nhowever most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way nto pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat paul reubens who disappeared from acting to everyones joy returns here leaving very little to be impressed about nas a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes nfart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of american pie and theres something about mary n mystery men drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining nanyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way nso why continue to watch nthis film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure n mystery men indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says i knew you could do it n mystery men fails in every category it attempts to pass nwhat makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable nterrible acting terrible script and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors n im unpredictable nan overexcited ben stiller shouts out nno ben youre the complete opposite n

battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close nin fact ill be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years nbased on the novel by scientology guru l ron hubbard battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information nits the year 3000 and an alien race called the psychlos which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers conquered our planet in nine minutes nok we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind nwhen were we conquered nthe audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 000 years earlier and if that is the case then were going to get into a whole bunch of problems later trust me nkeep reading nalso why dont we get to see earth get conquered nhow the hell do you make a popcorn scifi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film nhumans now live as cavemen or slave labor and for the films first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver colorado nthey grunt and groan and babble about monsters nso when the psychlos conquered earth were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills nnone of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered whenever that was nthis is definitely not the way to start an actionscifi film none of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster and he begins to fight it nthe monster turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course nhe turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course with some shrubs growing over them nso in 1 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time with only a few weeds growing over it nanyway some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl john travolta a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit nthe cavemen led by barry pepper are forced to do their bidding or whatever but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet or something nso these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 000 years earlier nand were supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who cant even handle a few cavemen none of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos nso jets left unattended for 1 000 years are still able to fly nplease if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood nwhy did the psychlos leave jets around anyway nshouldnt they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us nthe psychlos refer to humans as man animals but yet dogs are still dogs nwhy arent they dog animals nthe psychlos are after mining earths precious resources but for 1 000 years are unaware of fort knox nwhy do i even care at this point nim a fan of travoltas and im glad to see hes back on the alist in hollywood despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon nbut how did he possibly think this was a good movie nand how did he think he was giving a good performance here nhes more than capable of making a menacing villain see broken arrow and faceoff but whenever his character came on screen i couldnt hold back my laughter nnow despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have travolta just looks like travolta nall of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face but travolta just has a goatee nalso travoltas acts with a sort of phony upperclass snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world nooooo scary villain nas a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better nyou can make a dumb but good scifi film i love independence day for example but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth ni did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening ni cleaned my glasses walked around the theater made a grocery list chose my lottery numbers for the week replayed super bowl xxv in my head with commercials nand still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids nby the time we actually reach the year 3000 people should still be avoiding this film nfolks save your cash ndont go see it dont rent it and dont buy it nyoud be more entertained by taking the money youd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind watching it sail away hell send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal nwell entertain you plenty with that kind of money nunless of course youre just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running which is just about all youll come away with from this movie nthat and a headache neditors note for some reason though the day after my screening i converted to scientology nim not sure why nsomething just made me feel compelled make the choice

late in down to you the lead female character julia stiles states her greatest fear is having an artificial conversation with her boyfriend freddie prinze jr nthe irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out fallen asleep or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy nthe film is a multimillion dollar testament to everything artificial nfilled with characters motivation plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster nprinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles freshman coed nat first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of outdoing the previous in how cute it can be nthe happy couple psychoanalyze each other they pick out a song because as prinzes dj mother lucie arnez explains every couple needs a song he smells her shampoo she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love nthen in standard romantic comedy style things fall apart nwhy nwell because they have to notherwise the couple cant make up and live presumably happily ever after ndown to you exists outside the realm of normal logic nscenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead na picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together or even knowing each other but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat nthe supporting characters are remarkably flat and insultingly ridiculous as well nstiles best friend rosario dawson is a pot head prinzes roommate shawn hatosy is a girl crazy fool who cant meet women and then there are the porn stars zak orth and selma blair nhe is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television does the college lecture circuit and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film nyou know the average porn star nthe costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime hes on screen the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes nshe is a porn star mostly so we know shes slutty so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted nattempts at drama which means julia is going to cry include a pregnancy scare and the big break up nthese characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes nwhat happened here nthe cast is full of likable promising young actors stiles especially seems to be going places nwriterdirector kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off nin fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last years extremely unpleasant the story of us for teen audiences nthe direction is filmschoolgrad obvious nits stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen a pointless parody of cops characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion nplus the whole story is told flashback style narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera nthis is the second film in a row following wing commander starring freddie prinze jr which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of shes all that nif he doesnt start making better choices fast his future films wont be so lucky n
my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love ni love ralph fiennes ni love uma thurman ni love sean connery nhell im even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw ni saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago and ive been eagerly awaiting the film ever since na few months into the summer however i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times and that it had ended up in the midaugust dumping ground nthen in this final week before its official release i learned that it was not to be screened for critics nand that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs nand that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique nmy expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things nthe film i saw today didnt even meet those expectations nthis is a lousy incoherent mess ni would slam it harder if it werent for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine lovable actors nbut sets are ultimately empty and the performances are completely uninspired nthats the main problem with the avengers for all its hiphop flash and tidal waves none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired nits like a chore a bland exercise in superhero film making nit also feels like its been cut to pieces clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots nthis is just plain depressing nthe avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show nfrequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that ive never watched an episode ni wasnt alive then ni dont even watch television now nim very sorry that i dont have this perspective but judging from the reviews ive already read knowing the tv show just makes matters worse ni didnt know and love john steed and emma peel and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles ni also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film nbased on what the film told me i gather that steed fiennes is some kind of british super guy somewhat like james bond and that dr peel thurman is just a really smart doctor who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits nthey are to work together under mothers orders mother is played by jolly jim broadbent while his coconspirator father is played by the equallytalented fiona shaw nit seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather nhis name is de wynter connery nhe is a crazy scottish guy nour heroes had better stop him or else n n nthe weather will keep getting colder until they have to go to hell to warm up one of the films few funny lines nalong the way there is subplot after subplot hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere feel perfunctory and ultimately make no sense nfor example our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos nnow killer bugs dont really go with the weathercontrolling theme of the film nthe purpose of the bugs other than to annihilate our heroes is never established ntheyre never even directly connected to de wynter theyre controlled by his crazy henchman played by eddie izzard nthe special effects arent bad but theyre loud obnoxious and intrusive nlike so many scenes in the film it seems present only to keep your attention from waning nand i guarantee you it will wane ni stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didnt do any good to think nthe avengers has clearly been chopped up and reassembled so many times that even the people involved couldnt tell us what happens nthere are several scenes in the preview that didnt make the final cut nin addition many of the sequences have irritating grainy film quality which makes it feel lowbudget the last scene is particularly bad nthe scenes that dont feature action should be electric thanks to our wonderful cast nthey arent nthe action scenes should be electric because this is an action film nthey arent either nand what about this wasted cast noh it makes me weep with disappointment nwere talking ralph fiennes here one of the best actors working today one of the best actors ever ni love the guy nive loved all his films until this one nhe seems like he wants to understand the film but hes as lost as we are nand thurman in all of her spectacular beauty and talent cant manage to look at home here n i dont blame her completely for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way and it cant be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting nconnery however seems the most out of it totally lacking any kind of focus or interest for that matter nwho is to blame nis it the screenwriter don macpherson nperhaps although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right nis it the actors nfor gods sake no these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling ni blame director jeremiah chechik who shouldnt have been given the task to begin with nhis best film benny joon is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor nadd to that a lack of experience in bigbudget action and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory nif the avengers has a saving grace its the set design nthe sets by stuart craig are big colorful and often pleasing to look at ni like the final setpiece on de wynters island even if none of it makes a bit of sense ni admired the overhead view of the stairs showing dr peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere ni also enjoyed michael kamens music score particularly in the opening credits nbut this stuff is routine good sets and music are nice but theres a lot more that needs to be here ninspiration for instance would have been really nice nmaybe a little bit of cohesion in the story nor a sense of purpose nmost of all though i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles ndamn this movie for not giving them the chance n
there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strongworded attack on a group of stoic doctors nwhen i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture nyou see patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries ni hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it and i actively hate it now days later with the simpering superficial nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories ni hate every element of the film beginning with tom shadyacs shameless direction and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey nthe badness of patch adams is stupefying nits confounding ni cant believe a film can be this bad nand yet its based on a real man who probably has a good point to make nin the film patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human nin the beginning of the film patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesnt want to kill himself nwhile there he notices that the doctors dont care about the patients and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings nso patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients nhe goes to medical school where he meets truman daniel london and convinces him that its good to help people nhe also meets carin fischer monica potters the antimale med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor nnaturally the dean of the medical school bob gunton hates patch and wants to thwart his plans even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams nso patch decides that hes going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have nand that my friends is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 non a superficial level the film is not particularly bad i wouldnt say the cinematography bothered me and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for i actually liked potters performance even if she is wasted nbut the film fails fundamentally in execution nevery scene swells with grand emotional music played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard ntake for instance the first scene which shows patch sitting on a bus nwe dont know patch yet but theres sad music and its supposed to make us really sad that hes sad nlater on patch makes a lot of progress he helps a dying patient peter coyote to enjoy the last days of his life and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively nand when that patient finally dies spoiler alert the music is very very sad nbut the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions nreal drama is characterbased nyou grow to like someone and then something bad happens and you feel it nwe dont ever grow to know the dying patient hes simply a vehicle for patchs greatness nreal drama doesnt seem forced or present just to make the audience cry nthats why patch adams is not real drama nit goes for every cheap tear imaginable wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene neven scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaimans sickening musical score nsentimentality like this is indeed bad nbut its not as bad as halfbaked simplistic themes nyou see patch is a really great student nhe aces his tests without studying and does it so effectively that people think hes cheating nbut patch doesnt think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor n why dont we see patients until the third year he bursts out every three seconds nwell patch that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort nmost of us have to study nand a doctor who really wants to help but doesnt know a toe from a finger probably wont be too successful in preventing death noh wait i almost forgot the point of doctors is not just to prevent death but to improve the quality of life nyes nthat is true nand you can not do that without studying nyou can not do that without going to medical school nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe just maybe it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later nfollow the rules nbah nwho needs the rules nonly uptight doctors follow the rules nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants nand then theres the free clinic issue which i find shockingly frighteningly idealistic na free clinic nin the middle of the forest nwhere patients can be taken to be helped nfor free nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic nwill it have an emergency room nor is it just for mental patients nand who may i ask will pay for it nthe film does give some token attempts to question patchs motives i think another character asks him how hes going to pay for it in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance but they certainly dont explore or challenge patchs ideas to any meaningful extent nreader please understand this i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams ni know nothing about him nif his beliefs mirror those of this film character then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them nbut regardless of what the real patch adams believes the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony nand in the last scene the big obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus patch does a lot of shouting nactually robin williams does a lot of shouting nhe shouts a lot about helping people and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words ni wont tell you that you cant be moved by his words because i too was moved by his words ni was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be npatch adams is the cheapest of them all n
tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers all searching for deeper meaning nhowever they wont find much meaning in the real blonde and not enough real humor either njoe matthew modine is a struggling actor or he claims to be one even though he has no credits under his belt nhis girlfriend mary catherine keener has no pretensions about her career shes a makeup artist working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair marlo thomas and supermodel of the month sahara bridgette wilson nsahara who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid has an onagain offagain relationship with joes best friend bob maxwell caulfield nhowever bob has gotten his biggest break yet a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly daryl hannah who may be that illusive woman hes always pursued a real blonde nthere are some moments of good humor in the real blonde but not enough nthe best stuff is in throwaway details in the background such as saharas perfume ads depression its not just a state of mind nbut to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel nand unfortunately the films forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic ntake for example the films framing device of an old lady and her dog nthe story serves absolutely no purpose makes little sense and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie nmatthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film but theyre stuck in the most boring plotlines nmodine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley who appears as another struggling actor nkeeners character has a stronger edge but the insult selfdefense class taught by denis leary no less she is stuck in makes little sense nthe movies running time is under two hours but it seems like it is well over it ntheres just not enough humor to speed things along and not enough meaning to propel any drama n
1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood two movies dealing with the same subject or to be precise same high concept nin summer 1994 that high concept was mad bomber action thriller nin few weeks thrillride of the summer actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes nthe movie begins in the prison in northern ireland where gaerity tommy lee jones ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material escapes from prison nhe comes to boston where he accidentally notices jimmy dove jeff bridges dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police nfew people except gaerity know the doves violent past when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose ngaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror directed specifically at doves colleagues friends and relatives ndove who is just going to retire and start family now must confront the mad bomber nwhile speed doesnt even try to bother with plot and characters using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story nand that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed nbadly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all nscreenplay by john bateer and john rice barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama nthe plot is of course full of implausibilities nthe main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual no matter how brilliant he is can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay nthose questions same as in the case of speed could be forgotten while the action goes on but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters nbecause of them movie seems a little bit too long and boring at times nthe most annoying element of the film however is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber nhis acting is so overthetop that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself nthis role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive nthe film have few bright points though nsome of the action scenes are fine which should be credited to director stephen hopkins predator ii judgement night nand forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of doves colleague nbut all in all blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous yet hardly unforgettable competitor n
vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly dangelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family nas with the other three films their two children rusty and audrey are played by a revolving series of actors nthis time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles nalso back is cousin eddie randy quaid the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes nin vegas vacation clark griswold chase decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen dangelo can renew their wedding vows nit is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue napparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldnt bother to write any jokes into the script nat least thats the way it looks when watching this turkey nabout half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film since there had been none up to that point nby the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times and i had smiled at a couple of gags ni might add that none of the funny and i use the term loosely moments came as a result of anything chase dangelo or quaid were involved in nthey might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film nthe two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids who manage to have a couple of their own adventures nrusty becomes a vegas high roller providing most of the films best moments nevery time chase and quaid were involved in a gag it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film nwhich brings me to the best moment of the film nthe griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road the theme from the original vacation begins to play nchristie brinkley and her red ferrari also from the first movie drive by nit was a cute moment but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been and just how far that this series has fallen ntoo bad n
at the end of an action scene in lara croft tomb raider a wall collapses near the nubile warrior nwith her face on the floor she gazes into the rubble then grins abruptly and says oh my car keys ni mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned production that made me smile nbased on an incredibly popular video game lara croft tomb raider is a lousy movie nthe structure goes like this poorlystaged action sequence boring exposition poorlystaged action sequence boring exposition etc etc the end nbasically the film exists to showcase angelina jolies puffy lips and enhanced tits ncloseups are framed ohsocarefully to include her million dollar bazooms nrunning scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage baywatch fashion ntheres even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them nbut the filmmakers are so inept they cant even flash the audience correctly nthe one extended display of nudity is of get ready for this a guy nfor no particular reason a muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds with each shot composed to barely cover his package la austin powers nnow i enjoy a good looking male body as much as the next gay guy but what the hell is beefcake doing in a ta flick aimed at heterosexual males nof course what else should one expect in a film that does virtually nothing right n tomb raider sets up elaborate action set pieces then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing a promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts nit promises a series of exotic locales then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies nthrow in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons nintended to be a rousing indiana jones style adventure tomb raider lacks any sense of tension nthe low point comes when lara is threatened by statues of monkey warriors and a giant multiarmed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi neasily the lamest menaces i have ever seen the creatures move like snails and fall apart with a single shot from a gun nif you ever have to be chased by monsters pray that you get the monkey warriors n tomb raider tells a story sort of nonce every 5 000 years the planets align na group of very bad men are out to find two halves of an object that if reassembled just as the planets align will give them control over time itself nlaras goal is to stop them and rescue her longmissing poppa jon voight jolies real life dad nnone of this matters though because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of lara croft tomb raider is as lame as ever other aspect of the film except angelina jolies lips and breasts n
its probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre the matrix existenz would collide with the even more popular serialkiller genre kiss the girls se7en nthe result should have been more interesting than the cell nas the movie opens therapist catharine deane jennifer lopez treats a catatonic boy colton james by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique thats never fully explained nafter months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert catharine has no success to report nmeanwhile killer carl stargher vincent donofrio has claimed another victim nhis particular hobby is to kidnap young women keep them in a glass cell overnight and drown them nhe takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning nalthough carls been doing this for awhile hes recently become sloppy and fbi agent peter novak vince vaughn is closing in fast nnot fast enough though to keep carl from sticking another woman tara subkoff in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma nfrom the videos in carls house peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction nto save the kidnapped girl peter has to find the cell before the end of the day and comatose carls not talking nso off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carls mind and find out where the cell is in time nthe focus of the cell in on the ornate interior of carls mind but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computergenerated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality nfor the most part its style without substance nin his own mind carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes ming the merciless as well as a frightened boy jake thomas abused by his father nall in all the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place and i kept wishing i could fastforward to the next development nsingh is best known for directing music videos particularly rems losing my religion and the cell seems very much like a really long really slow mtv video with the sound deleted nsinger lopez seems to think shes in a video as well she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting nthe premise had great promise nthe computergenerated world within carls mind could have been a bizarre surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic nthe first room catharine enters in carls head shows this promise nshe finds a horse standing in center of the room suddenly sheets of sharpedged glass fall into the horse dividing it into segments nthe panes of glass separate pulling apart the pieces of the stillliving horse nthis scene is twisted disturbing and thoughtprovoking because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder nanother element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath ntheir minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharines own psyche nlike sidney lumets the offence or michael manns manhunter the cell could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator nhowever catharines character is hardly developed at all and lopez has no depth to offer the role nbottom line dont get trapped in this one n
this review contains spoilers but believe me i dont say anything you cant guess 10 minutes into the movie ni did go into this one with high expectations ni had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks ni sort of expected another exorcist or the shining ni even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film nboy was i wrong nanother garbage slasher flick the only difference being that this one has a story nthe story you ask nwell a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk nhe takes it home somehow getting it past customs and starts fiddling with it in his attic nlo and behold after he takes it apart three demons appear and start taking him apart but with meat hooks nwhen theyre finished his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling nthey botch up their cleanup job however and manage to leave his heart or some gland i didnt really recognize the organ under a floorboard nthe guys brother and his brothers wife appear at the door soon after and decide to move in nthey throw away scumballs belongings and set up house nturns out that wife is a bit of a nympho and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage nshe starts having some wild hallucinations nlater hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards slowmo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the groundall from the tiny cut on his hand nsaid blood is eagerly sucked up by scumballs organ nthe organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing nit establishes mind contact with wife who agrees to help him get more blood because she really wants to be screwed again nso she helps him kill three businessmen nscumball at this time gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back nproblem is he doesnt have any skin and even after three or four corpses still doesnt get any skin nhe finally gets some though but strangely enough he ends up looking like his brother nguess they couldnt get the original actor back nwho knows nscumball whose name is frank is not a nice guy nhe describes his torture by the demons fondly as the ultimate pleasure and pain since at that level there is no difference between the two nsomehow i dont see getting torn apart by 90 fish and meathooks a lot of fun nthis guy is so bad how bad is he n so bad that the rats cower in a corner in fear nfor good reason too he crucifies two of them for fun and carves a third while the nymphos horsing around with hubby nanyway hubbys daughter who if course is not wifes daughter starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams nthe dumb bimbo meets scumball and is not impressed nshe manages to escape with the chinese puzzle and brings out the demons nat any rate the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup theyre normally quite meticulous about that type of thing nthe story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake nthe demons are not however the good guys nthe dumb bimbos the good guy nshe somehow not only gets them to take care of frank but also banishes them to hell or oblivion were not too sure which nnot too shabby for someone with singledigit iq nthis is basically a bad jinn story nit is an awful movie nawful acting bad focus in the photography many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks which is really unrealistic and looks like the latex that it is ncontinuity nwho cares nacting n terrible nscript nhorrible nsounds canned nunrealistic nstory is soso but the impact is lost long long before the film ends ni do think the rat acting was quite good ni have never seen rats look afraid nthey should get nominated for an award nreally good acting there the best in the movie n the envelope for best furry rodent please na rating would be far too generous na 110 rating or 4 in the 4 to 4 rating system is far more accurate nthis movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog ni can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show npeople were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen nhad to have something to do ndumb dumb dumb movie ni was embarrassed that i spent money to see it nit goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself nlots of slime and reddyed corn syrup does not constitute horror in my opinion n
last summer a featurelength version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning nbased on the famous 60s television show the film was an enormous boxoffice flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros a year later the studio is up to their old tricks again with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild wild west nbut it sounded promising the same tagteam of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success is at the reins again nand costar kevin kline is attached to the project as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects ni mean what could possibly go wrong nthe answer is just about everything nwild wild west is a cinematic abomination a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate nthere are a lot of fancy special effects and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression nbut the script is so deliriously uneven the entire movie so off course that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it nat square one we have a bizarre case of casting nwill smith plays james west a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series nmy guess regarding the casting of africanamerican smith is a simple one the actor a cozy summertime release big bucks for all those involved nsmith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material but this is not an ideal role for him nhes too much of a joker ni heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role and frankly that sounds a lot more plausible nwhat makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such selfassurance in his eyes you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office nthe plot involves west and crossdressing government agent artemus gordon kevin kline who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists nthe trail leads to the diabolical dr arliss loveless kenneth branagh a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry witty southern accent nloveless has taken the countrys top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns none such weapon is an 80foot mechanical tarantula bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right nthe visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular seamlessly blending computergenerated imagery with the western surroundings nunfortunately all of these effects seem so detached from the story and can do little to support the films plot deficiencies which are undoubtedly the main problem nwild wild west is a running gag that never truly works nmost of the jokes usually care of smith die on arrival nif its one thing that could possibly be the saving grace its the performances and even they are mostly offkilter and poorly delivered nkline is admirable but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot nsalma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest because she is viewed as little more than that window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon nbranagh an esteemed shakespearean actor and director adds marginal enjoyment to the film nbut even he is so utterly weird and overthetop nrarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is ni suppose theres always one turkey of the summer season a highly anticipated bigbudget release that manages to completely disappoint nwild wild west is such a movie and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 nbut it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office nperhaps after this audiences will be less assured when they see will smiths name stamped on a summer movie nafter such hits as independence day and mib wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume n
boy what a great movie nkeanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together the director of the fugitive andrew davis back again to give us another thriller and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot nhow could this not be a blockbuster nall diehard keanu reeves fans read on nol much ado about nothing plays eddie kasalivich a machinist studying at the university of chicago nto help pay for the rent he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university nby happy coincidence he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics nthis project holds great promise taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in na potential solution to the earths energy problems without the pollution cost nsurely nobody could have any problems with that nmorgan freeman is paul shannon the projects sponsor nhe works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public nhe figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly nso he murders the project leader blows up the project great but short scene here sort of like a mini id4 citydevastation thing and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hitech hushhush location nunfortunately our intrepid machinist and an english physicist weisz manage to get away and now follows a fugitivelike chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script nthis movie is just dying for a comparison with the fugitive nboth movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesnt change much i guess we cant really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere nthe trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward ncredit to them but we arent really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters nwhere ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves character is never given the time to develop nit might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences which frankly get quite boring after a while nharrison ford was the man against the world nhe was alone in a world where he didnt know who to trust and it came across real well nin chain reaction keanu reeves isnt alone nnow that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia vulnerability and confusion nwe dont get this nwe get him thinking hes still in speed only now our sandra bullock has an english accent probably doesnt drive a bus and hardly contributes anything to the movie nthe producers here probably thought hey what if keanu and rachel dont hit it off too well nlets rope in that morgan to help us out nwell keanu and rachel didnt hit it off well on the screen and most unfortunately morgan freeman doesnt help much either nthe only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder nits not really his fault nonce again andrew davis just doesnt take the time to build his characters nsomeone must have convinced him that this time round cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken nthe flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast n a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha n pretty good bring a friend n amazing potent stuff n perfection nsee it twice n

the film may be called mercury rising but that title doesnt describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture a routine thriller that combines government coverups with a cloying and poorlymotivated buddy story nthe hook that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic nhowever aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device nthose expecting to see even a semithorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed nmercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism nthe script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard toswallow ni dont know whether the problem is in the original book simple simon or in the screenplay adaptation but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible nonce again certain standby plot elements the highlevel government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent are recycled and not to good effect nwhile bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense nthe story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold art jeffries bruce willis is confronted with his own failure nunable to resolve a hostage crisis in time he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death nthe event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavyhandedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9year old simon lynch miko hughes when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player nsoon art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time with the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player always just a step behind them nalong the way they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy chi mcbride and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest kim dickens nwhy is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player napparently the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultrasecret code called mercury nto make sure it cant be cracked they do the most intuitive thing possible place a sample of it in a nerds puzzle magazine nof course no one can solve it no one except autistic simon that is nwhen he calls the phone number listed in the solution he gets the nsa nas a result the coldhearted sneering government man alec baldwin decides that simon has to be eliminated for the good of the country of course nbut he hasnt counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold even though everyone in the audience has nits hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesnt do anything exceptionally well and does quite a few things rather poorly nfor those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from timetotime but even the most exciting scenes such as the one where art and simon are crouched down avoiding passing trains arent that pulsepounding nthe climactic struggle is a real hohum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness noverall director harold becker is constantly struggling and failing to generate even a moment that isnt derivative or obligatory nbruce willis star seems to be fading nthis is his fourth straight lackluster outing following last man standing the fifth element and the jackal nwillis isnt terrible but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through and often does nalec baldwin combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice does some scenery chewing but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace nthe films real star is young miko hughes heather langenkamps son in wes cravens new nightmare who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual but is about 50 years younger nmercury rising joins the likes of hard rain the replacement killers and u s marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers nfor those who like action and adventure in the theater this has not been a good year nhopefully the advent of summer will change that nuntil then the best choices for bruce willis or any other action hero are on video nand if youre determined to see mercury rising check out the morning sky in early may n
recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldnt sleep nhe tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour nthen he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food nthen he took down a volume of shakespeares work and read it cover to cover never really paying attention to the words or plot nand then as a climax he took out his video camera and pressed the on button nthe result nwilliam shakespeares romeo juliet the worst film ever made and a complete failure nthough to be fair an interesting complete failure nthe idea at the films core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds nthis is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we cant see what is going on nand filming the dialogue in voice over nand shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model nand making the frame go still while flashing the characters name at the bottom nand filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion ni mean man this is the 90s dude nhowever ive seen terrible films that are fun to watch n examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau n that rule doesnt apply here nthis is a film that takes itself seriously nthat is its major fault nanother problem was pointed out by my friend alex who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout n the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didnt take sides nhere its clear that we are supposed to side with romeo n just look at the way they film him n from the begining hes our hero and this doesnt work nand dicaprios awful performance doesnt help nluhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us nthe result is a mess nyou can feel him striving to be something he isnt nhe tries to pull of a mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles nhe tries very hard nkey word tries n oh look hes filming above water action from below npretty nwhat does it represent nwhy do people do ugly things ni scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if i could never read the play again and keep a straight face n
there was probably a good reason that the warner bros studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened nand after seeing this piece of toxic waste i now know why nthis movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago nfire down below centers its story on a little mining town in gods country somewhere in eastern kentucky nits beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate kris kristopherson who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role nit turns out that hes filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit nseagal plays jack taggert an aikidoversed fighting machine who is an agent with the epa nno not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa nits the environmental protection agency ni had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers ntaggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice nwritten by someone named jeb i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships banjopicking preachers and dumbasnails rednecks nbut the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in nseagals idea of a disguise is a longlength 1000 leather jacket nbut to get closer to the kinfolk he will fix peoples porches for free nthats another great epa asset teaching agents how to fix porches nslow and plodding this project is a total mess nthe sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige nhere his bravado basically turns into bullyness ntownsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued nfight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever nand his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes nthe most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony gets behind the pulpit and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment nbut the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping kristopherson meets up with seagal nkristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away nseagal gallantly replies ill leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth ni was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background nthis is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagals righteousness and narcissistic arrogance nseagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace that of the envirothriller on deadly ground nhowever the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this nstill i believe in preserving mother earth so save your 5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity n

not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie nearlier this year nora ephron wrote and produced one of the years least likeable comedies called hanging up featuring a bunch of annoying women ironically lisa kudrow played one in that film as well who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves nick real nsweet stuff nbut her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer with a film entitled battlefield earth ni seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film even if it was on a cheese factor as everybody and i mean everybody else pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time nyipes another nbeauty nso what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie costarring the everversatile lisa kudrow nuhhhm you guessed it not nmuch nplot in order to escape major financial difficulties a local weatherman hooks up with his ballpicking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery nbut as more and more people find out about their scheme more and more people demand a part of their winnings and more and more problems arise ncritique simply stated i didnt laugh once during this entire picture nfor a comedy it offered me a few smiles a bunch of nincompoops as characters a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow in what can only described as a sluttier version of her character of phoebe on tvs friends nthis film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be but it was pretty close nthankfully the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits dancing as the weatherman were left in the films trailer and not in this final cut nand not unlike the worst movie of the year so far beautiful this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast nforemost was travoltas character who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie nand for me the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong nhe didnt fit the part ni just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role na cool calculating roughneck with a certain hip suave je ne sais quoi nin this film he looks like hes trying to be funny trying to be bad trying to be good nwere not supposed to be able to notice that and when we do at least in my case i consider it a wrong choice in casting nadd that to lisa kudrow boring us with yet another one of her patented dumb blonde routines but this time dressed in sexier outfits nmichael rapaport stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isnt quite up at the same speed level as everyone else nand a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells and youve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize nthe only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually halfinteresting and never really bored me ni also liked michael moores perverted cousin character and i loved and i say it again loved the character that bill pullman played ngive this dude his own movie nhe played a lazy cop a man who tries everything not to do any real work nhe fakes injuries to get off duty tries to avoid arrest situations so that he wont have to fill out any forms now ntheres a base of humor nsadly the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film nand theres not much else i can say about this movie folks non the whole it was lame included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines and very little of interest for any target audience nbut get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and im there n

as bad as mimic was it definitly scared me n mimic continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie ndirector guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film cronos nthat movie worked because it took an unconventional story unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie nin mimic del toro doesnt bother to give us anything original nthe plot is a stupid combination of aliens meets species meets jurassic park nthe characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies ntheres nothing new in mimic nits just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work nat the end of the movie youre stuck wanting your money back nmaybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies he forgot to turn the lights on ni dont understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the seven trend and be set in dark dank areas nwatching mimic i was tempted several times to yell at the screen turn the lights on nthe switch is to your right nuse common sense njust do it nyoull be able to see the monster in the corner ntheres a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off nit looked like the light operator was having a seizure and sorvino didnt even notice she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts n hmmm ni think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight n mimic has a lot of incidental shock tactics boo njust kidding and follows them up with the real scare but nothing in this movie scares you nthe audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments i think they were bored too ni shouldnt blame del toro nhe isnt the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie nhong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time the killer and hard boiled then came to america to make the stupid broken arrow nfrench directors luc besson la femme nikita and george sluizer the vanishing followed woos lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies nrobert rodriguez who directed the terrific low budget el mariachi came to hollywood and directed the horrible highbudget desperado ni dont know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country cant make a good american movie nwoo finally broke through and made faceoff but it still isnt up to par with his earlier films ni get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director welcome to america ni bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long ndo you speak english nnow i know you think youve made good movies in the past but now youre in america so things are a little different here njust remember what the american audience always wants and youll be fine nthey want to see at least one big breasted woman characters that theyve seen a thousand times before because change scares americans and you always need a cheesy feelgood ending to wrap things up nif you dont make that kind of movie youll be shining my shoes in no time n
its a good thing most animated scifi movies come from japan because titan a e is proof that hollywood doesnt have a clue how to do it ni dont know what this film is supposed to be about nfrom what i can tell its about a young man named kale whos one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and regenerating what is left of the human race nthats a fine premise for an actionpacked scifi animated movie but theres no payoff nthe story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil dredge aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason nso in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights fistfights blaster fights and more doublecrosses than you can shake a stick at ntheres so much pointless scifi banter its too much to take nthe galaxy here is a total ripoff of the star wars universe the creators dont bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring ndespite the fantastic animation and special effects its just not an interesting movie n

a big busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch the great white hype stars samuel l jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging payperview revenues is to invent a white contender peter berg to challenge his black heavyweight champ damon wayans n the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs white than black vs black nhe may be right in an absurdly accurate way but the film doesnt give us a reason to care nas a scathing sports spoof hype is just that unfunny unfocused and at times just plain pointless nas a commentary on race relations its even less effective nthe dialogue is the best of this mess lines like jon lovitz exclaiming i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs nwriters tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang though we never hear enough of it nthe script isnt strong enough though to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin house party nhe comes across as absolute overkill nthe great white hype almost turns around at the end at the big match when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rockconcert proportions nwith costumed dwarfs gangsta rappers and the champ dressed as death only then do we get a glimpse of the spoof that shouldve been n
deserves recognition for achieving the nearimpossible task of making a grander monument to selflove than steven seagals on deadly ground ncapsule review a question after the floating baby ruth that was waterworld what in the were the hollywood execs who gave kevin costner the money to make another postapocalyptic movie thinking nin this 3 hour advertisement for his new hair weave costner plays a nameless drifter who dons a long dead postal employees uniform and gradually turns a nukedout usa into an idealized hippydippy society n judging by the costuming at the end of the movie the main accomplishment of this brave new world is in reinventing polyester nwhen hes not pointing the camera directly at himself director costner does have a nice visual sense and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly jingoistic film in the trustnoone 90s but by the time the second hour rolled around i was reduced to sitting on my hands to keep from clawing out my own eyes nmark this one return to sender n
heres a rarity a childrens film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject is there a god ndone well it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern childrens cinema nunfortunately it isnt nwith jumbled messages and an unclear audience wide awake was better left asleep nfifth grader joshua beal joseph cross is in the middle of a moral crisis nhis beloved grandfather robert loggia has died and joshua has begun a quest nhe wants to find god to discover why bad things happen nthis religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents dana delany and denis leary but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths nat his catholic school his favorite teacher sister terry rosie odonnell tries to give him guidance but this is a journey he must make on his own nmeanwhile he is having the most momentous year of his life nhe has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave timothy reifsnyder he gets his first crush and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey nit is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be non its surface it appears to be a kids film nhowever it deals with serious issues and is likely to be boring for todays instantgratification kids nand while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience wide awake asks serious questions but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer nif there were a bit more meat in the story adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie nthe actors who might have created a great cast odonnell leary and delany are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos nthe nostalgic elements best friend favorite teacher first crush etc have been done much better in other movies and actually seem more like filler here nthe films strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshuas relationship with his grandfather nthey show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie nmaybe the film would have been better if instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks it were set entirely during joshuas last year with his grandpa nit certainly would have been more entertaining nwide awake can best be described as a failed experiment nit starts out with noble aspirations but never delivers on its promise nparents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions that is if their kids arent bored to death first n
i am a steven seagal fan ni only say this now because mufti splenetik isnt my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things nany proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on nseagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones which well always hear when seagal does his limbtwisting thing rarely a female colead in sight unless its a reallife modelwife who hasnt worked since weird science and usually the worst possible titles you can imagine nnot to mention very straightforward plots generally allround bad dialogue and mr implacable leatherface himself in that same black outfit hes been in since nico doing his my hands are sharp nimble knives thing seagal the stoic sir petrified ponytail duke of dull nin the glimmer man seagal breaks out of this formula he gets a sidekick attempts to banter and puts on a new vest nhes also put on quite a lot of weight nsmall potatoes you may say a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to but damnit if it aint broke why fix it n more on this disappointed persons dashed expectations later nas jack cole seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past nwhile he and his partner played by keenen ivory wayans are investigating a series of ritual killings cole himself becomes a suspect especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole nit turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin you just cant trust these homicide detectives someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them and hence well you know that glimmer man thing nan increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman bob gunton coles former cia boss brian cox and deals involving chemical weapons nthe glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff drawing as with his other films elements from the hotter films of the year eg se7en nits the other changes that disappoint nfor example although theres a fair amount of violence in this movie theres also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans probably the best known of the wayans tribe how many are there exactly from televisions in living colour nwayans plays whiney straightman to seagals beadadorned and brocadedraped cole keeping up his are you crazy part of the dialogue with wasted zest nas campbell wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partners eccentric habits but the chemistry between the two is minimal and seagals wooden comebacks make for painful watching na cook in under seige 2 seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble nhe chants refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies nagain a benign if trite plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual nheck he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film nis that a lot to ask of the seague ntoo much nseagals best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages and to do it silently and alone nnot for seagal the snappy oneliners of arnold and stallone nor the attempts to show that he can act much less think nno kindergarten cop no oscar just simple unadulterated deathblows nthats really how it must have started likeminded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else nwe trusted him nwe got to know him nnow betrayal ni dont know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that hes going to try to be funny again nill try but it wont be easy nif you havent watched the glimmer man yet you might want to wait for the video to come out nits easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences nafter all if we cant depend on our fantasies what can we depend on nthe flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast n a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha n pretty good bring a friend n amazing potent stuff n perfection nsee it twice nmufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan neverybody makes mistakes once in awhile n
 because im a scientist nthats what we do n dr alexander mccabe bob gunton in response to why he created evil bats nalright folks stop me if youve heard this one genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals assisted by a specialist in the particular animals field must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth noh yeah the military is on their way to bomb the town as well so they are running short on time nsound familiar nsuch is the plot of the destination films release of bats ndina meyer stars as the bat specialist sheila who is pulled from her research along with her annoying sidekick played with irritating deftness by leon in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently nwith the help of the local sheriff lou diamond phillips a cdc official carlos jacott and a scientist bob gunton sheila discovers it is indeed bats who have been genetically altered by guntons character to be more aggressive and omnivorous in order to be used as a military weapon ni have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film ntheres not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good nin this respect the film never disappointed me nthis film reaches a level that transcends the so bad its good level and borders on the downright insane nthe effects are awful the script is contrived and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously i think ni challenge anyone to sit through the scene where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner with a straight face nthankfully the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with ndina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in johnny mnemonic dragonheart and starship troopers nthe latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit and this one is no exception nwhile one never really gets the impression that meyers character could be a bat expert in reality one never really cares to doubt it either nshe gives as good a performance as could be expected plus shes nice to look at for an hour and a half nlou diamond phillips is also serviceable here as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero nalthough when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for whats going on in town for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats nthe only bad performance in the film is that of leons nhe is relegated to the im not sticking around here ncharacter and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays nanyone who cant immediately tell that bob gunton the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised but i highly doubt it neven if he hadnt been the villain in just about every film hes ever been in so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever nin fact his death is welcome because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale nif the plot doesnt sound ridiculous to you yet then check out these little tidbits a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol nan entire town disregards the sheriff and doctors orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force killing several townsfolk na government official blows off shelias instructions to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats cave that will kill all of them off by pulling a night job resulting in the death of an entire military unit na cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it nfinally to top it all off this little texas town is showing nosferatu in its single screen theater for reference our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens and were lucky to even get kevin smiths dogma nthe most laughable part of the movie though comes from the illconceived bat puppets nwhile the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend whats going on the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more lowkey ntherefore we the audience get loving closeups of the most unrealistic rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film nbeing able to see the puppeteers arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse nafter all of this if you still decide bats might be the movie for you dont say you havent been warned ntrust me when i say that its a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through ni just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in nshes definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these n
this is the movie that could singlehandedly bring mystery science theater 3000 out of cancellation nits one of those movies thats so bad its absolutely hilarious due in no small part to its big star supermodel cindy crawford nif you only remember one thing about fair game it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues nif you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l a youll change your mind when you see fair game nireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition nin a real casting coup crawford plays a superintelligent lawyer in a jogging bra of course nwe all know this is a stretch the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day nnonetheless someone out there thought shed make a good lawyer but were reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in a period of twenty minutes nand for you horny teenage boys out there you actually get to see her topless for two seconds in the dark ncome to think of it that may have been a body double ncindy crawford isnt black is she nlike i said crawford is a lawyer with a bunch of russians after her nbilly baldwin or is it stephen nalec nadam nkim basinger is the police detective who has to save her life time after time chase after chase explosion after explosion ntheres absolutely nothing original about this movie nits every cop show of the 70s mixed with every action thriller of the 80s and every technology exploitation movie of the 90s nthree decades of crap all in one place driven further into the ground by crawfords complete lack of acting talent nand its all completely predictable nyou know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going to make before they make them you know when the sexual tension will finally end up in them consummating the relationship you know when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescue her in the climax and you know the movies going to suck from the first scene nthe plot isnt really explained until the end nall we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer nin the words of one of the villains we even know what size pantyhose she wears n yeah you and every 14yearold boy in america nhe goes on to add we know more about her than she does n that i find very easy to believe ni hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes because i wrote down plenty of other bad ones if it werent for me youd still be pulling bananas out of your ass in cuba nbecause you see fair game is not only a showcase for recycled action cliches and terrible acting but also some seriously bad dialogue nit all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasnt supposed to and grimace in places i was supposed to laugh none more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief nwould you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like im very interested in hardware and other crap about playing with his joystick ni wouldnt but not because im a computer nerd nits just not funny ncrawfords only contribution to the information age are a few gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords body nor was it jack lords body nill leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie nthe boat with all the russians has just blown up and baldwin and crawford are floating on a life raft ncrawford says woodenly that was my clients boat you just blew up nim filing a lawsuit against you nyoure in big trouble or something to that effect and baldwin replies smugly what do i have to do to get out of it nthey of course begin making out and the credits roll nim not going to talk about how stupid the line is or how if theyd really wanted to go for a bad closing line they would have had baldwin say you think i could settle out of court nbut i will tell you that if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game with him or her you quote the final line of the movie to that person what do i have to do to get out of it nserving america for over 150th of a century n

i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws nbut if you ask me the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american nor more the point anyone that allows him to bask in his own lessthansubtle presence nthis is not an insult to gere as i consider him to be a rather talented actor but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role nif a film is solely about one person the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work nalthough geres performance is in no way poorly acted it is far from perfect and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself nthis is where he truly belongs and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear with the sensational edward norton the jackal with bruce willis and pretty woman with the delightful julia roberts nin red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear bold and up front who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind nit is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail nit doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on a pretty chinese lady and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room drunk and cheerful nyet instead of a hangover poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch nhe is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison nhis cell food and rights all terrible nnow trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy lawyer shen yuelin bai ling defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder njack and shen argue about their countries different laws shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family nas the plot thickens scenes get progressively more ridiculous ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected butyouknewalong criminal is discovered nred corner is one of those films where you sneer laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes nwhat should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act nthis is not to say that the film does not have its moments there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption nbut what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch nif you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly the basic idea is quite tangible nit is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate the evidence that goes missing the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before nif that wasnt bad enough red corners dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions nshen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself ntaking itself far too seriously red corner is not half the film it intends to be nalthough it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast the films main fault is in the bizarre and often out of place way of unfolding a story which isnt that meritorious anyway nwhilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious yet hollow drama again nmartin vailwhere are you n
to sum the entire film 54 up in one sentence it would be watch a vh1 documentary instead n 54 seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978 brought him into studio 54 got him really drunk told him to write about it and then dumbed that down to be released to the public na sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex drugs and disco nthe narrator shane oshae ryan phillippe works as a grease monkey in new jersey who of course on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio 54 nphillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young attractive actor with a six pack stomach nhe is let in by steve rubbell mike myers the infamous coowner of studio 54 because he is attractive nhe eventually becomes a bus boy and then a bartender n n nyou expected more didnt you nthere isnt nthe film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as its climax isnt that an apt word for studio 54 lands with a thud nthe glitz of the club and perpetually semiclothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the its glamour nfor much of its target audience college age to early thirties it attempts to show celebrities mixing with normal people nthis even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol and truman capote nyou can be sure that half of the audience hasnt heard of them another quarter only know their names and the other quarter knew they were there already nthe humor if you can call it that is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and 70s references like john travolta and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back then nthe best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high sexually ambivlaent very new york steve rubell nhe seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive nhe looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving a subdued almost nostalgic performance when needed nit reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on coffee talk sans dress and wig nthe supporting cast of salma hayek breckin meyer and neve cambell are their only there to give added subplots which are introduced but lead absolutely nowhere nthe romance between phillippe and cambell as a soap opera star is completely implausable nthe two share about half as much screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes nhayeks wannabe singer seems extremely forced and her husband greg meyer stands in as shane oshaes surrogate best friend nthe subplots seemed forced and seem like they have been added just to make sure the film was over an hour and a half long noverall 54 tried to give a view of the brashness of the place where crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine nthe film never leads to anything has no obserable point and covers up a lack of real plot with a veil of beautiful people nin truth that reminded me of the eighies n
this was the last carry on movie if you discount carry on columbus as a carry on movie and was made by a new production company nbased in central london this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert suzanne danielle to bed her husband emile the french ambassador kenneth williams nwhen he seems unwilling she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes such as the prime minister and the u s ambassador nher antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages nshe is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead nmeanwhile theodore valentine larry dann is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her nhowever she is only interested in restoring her husbands ardour which seems a little difficult after emiles accident with a church spire nthis film is the second worst carry on movie the worst being carry on england nit is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written nnewcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid as mrs valentine are mildly funny but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad nkenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted given the script nthe small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler joan sims as mrs dangle kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur and peter butterworth as richmond are worthless and embarassing nin fact all four parts are surplus to requirements nhowever the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades nan awful script a terrible collection of jokes very poor production values especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st james palace a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score and a nonexistent plot or storyline nits just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next njack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile na complete waste of time this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies nit was a certificate 15 film but by 1978 there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 navoid at all costs n
the most absurd remake of 1998 nits a toss up between gus van sants psycho and mighty joe young the new disney picture based on the old rko picture n i knew i was in trouble when a polished computergenerated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits nthere is no great demand for another giant ape moviemake that ape movie period n witness the quick deaths of buddy born to be wild and congo nand while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable its also an assembly line product through and through lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it ntheron is jill young as a young girl in the wilds of africa she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers nthat baby gorilla nicknamed joe grows to immense proportions and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers nenter conservationist greg paxton who convinces jill to move with joe to california where they can protect him better in a controlled environment njoe is restless at first no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l a plotting joes demise nsuffice it to say the movie could have been called joe ape in the city ntheron so good in devils advocate and paxton so good in the recent a simple plan are fine actors but not fine enough to transcend the material a paintbynumbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising nthe plot arguably borrows more from steven spielbergs the lost world than the 1949 original with the computergenerated trexi mean joewreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third with jill shouting look joes headed for the movie theatre nfollowed by a shot of joe scaling manns chinese theater a moment later jill shouts again something like look joes headed for an amusement park and what do you know theres joe at the pallisades carnival scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers nthe seams of lastminute edits to mighty joe young showunrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves nthe movie sure feels uneven regardless act two is underdeveloped while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long long way nunderwood tremors speechless was perhaps not the director for the job even the plentiful untamed landscape looks dull in his hands n capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style ni did enjoy certain sequences especially the demoliton of a blacktie dinner sequence and the prologue however implausible is touching n as a tyke joe acts just like e t rick bakers makeup effects and puppetry are outstanding the real star of the showyet for all its technical flawlessness the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love n his facial expressions are variations on a scowl nto be fair i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing childrenits a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue nits certainly not a film for very young kidsintense fighting scenes may scare them while any time joes not on camera may bore them to tears n note older boys are more likely to be dazzled by therons colourful array of tank tops ni suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing but they sure dont make em like they used to n
 snake eyes is the most aggravating kind of movie the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing nits not just because this is a brian depalma film and since hes a great director and one whos films are always greeted with at least some fanfare nand its not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance this film is hardly worth his talents nits worse than that nits aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more could be totally intelligent and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of halfassedness nor more deservedly the hall of fame of the eighthassedness nin certain circles snake eyes was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawas classic rashomon where a crime is told from the four different and i mean different perspectives and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening which i might add is superb nin one very very very long steadicam shot we meet the protagonist crooked atlantic city detective rick santoro cage and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife interupts a payperview event on tv chases down a gambler enters the arena all pumped up for the fight sits down and talks with his bud kevin dunne gary sinise whos character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn whos also in this and watches as it happens ntheres a big name in the crowd and thats the secretary of defense charles kirkland joel fabiani whos sitting behind rick and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion lincoln tyler stan shaw is knocked out nthis all happens in the opening shot and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction nwhat really happened this film asks and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene and ndiscovers theres a very good possibility it was a conspiracy nas we follow rick trying to learn of more information we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot carla gugino and who flees the scene in a panic and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casinohotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness takes on what happened nthis is all going pretty fine and dandy and its extremely interesting to watch then nit takes one wrong step nwe follow the wrong character and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on and way before rick can find it out nbut thats not the worst part of it its that its the one person you didnt think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring the one you didnt think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it nit only gets worse the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film and since we already know what happened we cant rely on ricks investigation to be all that interesting nits as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in and decided to just fall back on an easy way out and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible nevents become more and more proposterous and by the end the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this the deux ex machina nthats where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay nthis time its a hurricane an outofcontrol police car and a big round ball that adorned the arena nwhat went wrong ndepalma and the screenwriter david koepp are extremely credible people in their respective fields and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this ndepalma who idolizes hitchcock to death has done many a film like this such as his masterpiece blow out where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece nbut granted depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch what with his overthetop shot setups notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel forgetting anything about boundaries nat least his direction makes up partly for it nthen theres koepp who showed such great ability at making a characters flaws come to life like he did in depalmas earlier carlitos way a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well nhe can write a flawed character but his rick santoro seems to be just a halfassed effort nhes flawed and we can see redemption if the story wasnt so formulaic na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says it would have at least gone with what the character was like nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way nas i was watching the first half hour i couldnt wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed how many different perspectives hed be given and perhaps hed have to make a choice between whos he has to believe nnow theres a film nunfortunately the film has two major deux ex machinas one in the disasterous ending the other about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap weve seen all too much before but never from someone like depalma n
i went to blair witch project 2 book of shadows with the highest of hopes nthe original film released last summer was genuinely scary and terrifying i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor nunfortunately my hopes were soon dashed nas the movie opens the audience is shown pseudodocumentary clips of burkittsville maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie nits a mostly humorous selfaware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film nduring this segment we are introduced to the protagonist a young man who sells blair witchrelated memorabilia from his website nthe movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously nwe see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies nwe see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarettesmoking doctor luridly leers above him nwe see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him nno explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution in fact these scenes are barely referred to again ni had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes generally a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting filthy interiors and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie nthe movie cuts again this time to the present nthe young man whose name is jeffrey played by jeffrey donovan as in the first movie the character names are identical to the actors names although this movie admits up front that it is fictional so theres no reason for the practice this time around is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the blair witch hunt which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website nwe meet tristen and steven a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience nsteven is a skeptic believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria ntristen on the other hand believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence nshe is wan and softspoken she complains that the radio is playing too loudly n she also complains that she feels nauseated i knew immediately that the character was pregnant and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out nhow did i know nbecause in bad movies nauseated women are always pregnant nthe fourth member of their party is erica a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch not evil nthey pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery nkim is dressed completely in black has extreme gothstyle makeup on and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch npresumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect its never explained nthe party of five heads off into the woods as promised nthey reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parrs house and set up camp complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the nights events nthere is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well but after a few words are exchanged the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere nthe movie veers off at this point to spend many long long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down nsexual innuendoes are tossed around much hard liquor beer and pot is consumed and nothing much else happens nthis would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary nthe next day the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed and that steven and tristens manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds like snow nthe videotapes are missing but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house right where the original blair witch tapes were found nooh nspooky nthe team goes back to jeffreys house a creepy old civil warera warehouse in the heart of the woods to regroup and review the tapes nthey soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night nwacky hijinks ensue ntristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch everybody starts finding these weird runelike burn marks on their bodies steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket nthroughout the entire ordeal jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps eventually tristen wanders in mutters something about reverse and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards nwhen they do this they discover what really happened during the five lost hours n one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes nokay if the videotapes were being buried then how were they recording themselves oh nnevermind nthis movie was awful nsimply awful nthe characters are broadlydrawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development nerica is the natureloving wiccan ntristen is the weak and sympathetic woman nsteven is the overbearing asshole nkim is the antisocial goth girl nold tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures nhow do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic nbecause shes pregnant nhow do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl nbecause she wears a lot of eye makeup nhow do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy nbecause he has jagged teeth and talks like hes straight out of deliverance nthis is weak storytelling at its worst nrather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action nit didnt work non top of being poorly developed most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid n honey you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie nlets get on a plane home n no ni am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out whats going on n ok nfrankly by the end of the movie i was rooting for the witch ni also felt that there was simply too much blood n gore in this film nthe first movie worked by never showing us the horror nthe witch was a palpable presence in that movie but we never saw it we never saw anything in fact nthe horror was all offscreen and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be nthis is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie nblair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the grossout nthis was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffreys throat and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort nknives plunge into flesh bloody fingers trail off into the darkness and none of it is explained until the very end when it was too late for me to care nthis movie didnt stop with showing us the gore either it went for broke and showed us everything nby the end of the movie there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours nit is all explained in fact it is all shown onscreen in loving detail ni confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster or see only brief glimpses mere suggestions of what the monster is it is not because i find the monster so terrifying but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying ni have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no monster that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind ni found this to be a miserably poor explanation if it was in fact the directors intent then he needs to have some words with the writer because it was not made clear at all n i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so nand if there was no witch then what about the vanishing tree nthe snowfall of manuscript paper nhm nblair witch 2 book of shadows was a horrible movie nfrom the poorlywritten characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the grossout shots it was a bad effort through and through n
when respecting a director you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect nwoody allen has made a couple lessthan good films and hes my favorite neven martin scorsese hasnt had a perfect track record nkevin smith after a smashing debut with the classic clerks stooped as low to sellout and make the dreadful mallrats ni mean so far the only director whos made several films none of which have been bad is richard linklater slacker dazed and confused before sunrise and suburbia all nwhich were great nnow i adore quentin tarantino nhis first two films were classic films the second one being one of the greatest films of all time nbut 1995 just wasnt that good of a year for him nhe made way too many tv appearances nhe mispronounced jackie chans name on the mtv movie awards nand he made this film n he was also awarded an oscar so i guess that would be a grand exception nrobert rodriguez is also a great director not a brilliant one but a cool one nive never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film so i cant comment on them nbut in this crap ensemble directors film all four give pitiful efforts npitiful for any director too nnow in all fairness ensemble director pieces never really work out nive never seen all of new york stories but have heard the first two films by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap i saw woodys one which was hilarious but not totally up to par but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film nexposition a simple one a bellhop ted the totally overdone tim roth whos a god and all but not in this one though he has a couple good moments is working on new years eve for his first shift in an old fancy hotel nhes the only one there again and he only has a couple rooms yet again nthe old bellhop the seemingly immortal marc lawrence who hated pulp fiction actually hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily nas the night goes on he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile nyea n the short films are presented in order btw nthe missing ingredient writerdirector allison anders starring sammi davis amanda decadenet valeria golino madonna ione skye lili taylor alicia witt nthis one starts it off horribly with no plot no intrigue and crap dialogue nthe situation is so terrible that its physically painful to watch nthe plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is gasp nstuck inside some object in their hotel room nthe witch that was supposed to bring it ione skye calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it nyeah thats what i said nstupid plot inane characters who arent interesting at all etc etc etc the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which in turn it wastes pitifully nnot even actually funny for a second nmy rating out of 5 no stars nthe wrong man writerdirector alexandre rockwell starring david proval jennifer beals and laurence bender nanother bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on nted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at coming back who are playing sex games nted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon nbut at least this has a bit of comedy in it just not that much nand david proval has never overacted as much nand its pulp fiction producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window na masterpiece compared to the first one but still nthe misbehavers writerdirector robert rodriguez starring antonio banderes tamlyn tomita lana mckissack danny verduzco salma hayek nwould a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayeks navel nnope nluckily shes on the tv dancing so we get to see her nsurprisingly enough when i read the screenplay about a year before actually seeing it this one seemed to have the most potential nit was fastpaced funny and well funny nbut when i watched it it seemed anticlimactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once nantonio overacts nicely and the two kids lana and danny are funny nbut as i said it moves slowly and in that way its more painful than funny nbut the ending was stupid and funny at the same time noh nthe plot antonio is a supposed gangster assumed really who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife tomita go out to get drunk at a new years party nantonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long but things go wrong it nwas okay nthe man from hollywood writerdirector quentin tarantino starring quentin tarantino bruce willis paul calderon and jennifer beals again nironically this one could be considered the best for a bad reason it best represents what quentin has done with this film nhe plays chester a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge boxoffice hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anticlimactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row ntheyre drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesnt light nthey also pay him a lot of cash nthis is so much exactly what this little film is about that its campy ntim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves cause theyve had hits major or minor nit took quentin to realize that nbut the thing is it doesnt seem like he realizes that nif he did id give this a good 3 stars nbut this sucked nit was anticlimactic and the dialogue wasnt very good nhe starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes nthat makes no sense nits cool for a while then he makes it uneven nits long and its just not very good nhopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one nconclusion whats the moral here nif youve made celebrated films dont do an ensemble piece nthey should have rewatched new york stories and then stopped in their tracks nnone of these have any point to them and theyre embarrassing to not only the writerdirectors but to the actors cause theyre working with crap nbut i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentins next directing job even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool from dusk till dawn which i found exhilerating ni love quentin and i suppose its good he made the man from hollywood because it makes him seem more realistic and not some god of cinema ni seem to respect directors if they arent gods and are actually human beings who make mistakes n the man from hollywood is his big mistake and lets hope he doesnt return her continuously n
steve martin shines but sgt bilko nfails to impress nbased on the popular 50s sitcom sgt nbilko follows the string of oldsitcomstomovie conversion fever nremember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back n brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped ni do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy but the tvconversionmovies are hitting our screens like wildfire sad to say with mixed success nsuch movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie nsgt nbilko frankly i have not seen any its original tv version even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd failed to entertain nsgt ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool place of vehicle storage and repair of fort baxter nthough totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out moneymaking opportunities from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4d pools nthough materialistic in mind bilkos methods has thoughtfully enriched the lives of the men of fort baxter providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that ncolonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn blissfullyconfused state bilko has managed to hide his operation though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it nbilkos state of ascent is suddenly underfire when the pentagon sends major thorn a tough cookie on army regulations to check on the progress on the 70 million hovertank project a new weapon under development within the forts grounds nto add to his problems thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major sabo done on him by bilko during their younger army days ndirector jonathan lynn who directed my cousin vinny in which marisa tomei won an oscar for bestsupporting actress managed to pull sgt nbilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter but that is about it nthere are really not enough laughterpackedmoments in sgt nbilko to fully entertain the average moviegoer nstill steve martins sgt nbilko is played with finesse and fullforce by the renowned comedian nwithout him sgt nbilko would have just fell flat on its face nsgt nbilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world nthe current trend in mixed successes in such tvconversions may be a blessing in disguise really at least it will force hollywood to rethink any of its initial intentions to turn another tvidea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity nunless you are a fan of the tvseries or love to watch steve martin in action you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres nim sure there are better ones around n
ive never written a review for a movie i havent watched all the way through but i had to make an exception with powder ni was about fortyfive minutes into this one at a friends house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house nso i never got to finish the movie and im sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie nbut i can at least get a partial review out of it because i saw enough to know this one wasnt worth finishing in the first place nthe movie centers around a freaky teenager whos spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents house nwhen grandpa dies taking his department store down with him social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder first and middle names ngold bond to a state home where we find out hes a different from the other kids nactually we find out hes different when we first see him because hes the most pale individual weve ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever nwhen powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie the father takes one look at him and says hes not my son nobviously nall i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago nso the whitefaced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids nthat is until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him wear his spoon you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass ndecisions decisions and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table nso if his father is the pillsbury dough boy his mother must be sissy spaceks carrie character nand you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes as we find out powder has some sort of superintelligence your i q ntest went straight off the chart nand attracts electrical power nthis first shows up as powder visits the world of high school if hes such a genius already why would he need a high school education and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblums science class ngoldblum plugs in a jacobs ladder device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powders chest nbut goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching instead of just unplugging the damn thing ni guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row following hideaway and nine months nthats about all i saw before the big fight began and let me tell you that was twice as interesting as the movie itself nbut like i said i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization nnone of these movies ever handle the subject properly instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guys personality overlooking his personal appearance ni already had the female character picked out the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room

bob the happy bastards quickie review nthe odd couple ii ngrumpy old men it aint nhell my fellow americans it aint nwalter matthau and jack lemmon team up again for an even more worn out vehicle than any of their films over the past few years nodd couple ii feels terribly generic where in the first movie made thirty one years ago feels like a wonderful tale nthats like repackaging campbells soup in a generic food can really nhow writer neil simon couldve made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me nthroughout the movie i really didnt laugh once nhonestly ni mean there were dumb situations yeah like the cropduster who let these old geezers have it without any notice but they just really didnt seem funny to me nand that car rolling off the cliff nthe only way i wouldve seen humor in that is if they were still in it nand the ending gets all supermushy too nin the final twenty minutes or so lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one then loses her matthau talks to his son a wasted jonathan silverman about his amrriage to lemmons daughter and of course lemmon and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands nooh i really gave a lot away there im sure nconsider it a hospitable gester you wont waste your time renting this muck n
a movie like mortal kombat annihilation works and must be reviewed on multiple levels nfirst theres the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie nbut occasionaly almost as if making an ironic selfdepreciating remark the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery nno no njust kidding nhad you going there for a moment didnt i nin all seriousness however and to be fair to the movie it is necessary to provide two viewpoints that of a movie watcher unfamiliar or only marginally familiar with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon and that of a fan of the first movie andor a fan of the games nthe first movie mortal kombat 1995 concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth and its 5 billion inhabitants nthe mortals won and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth nunfortunately shao khan was a poor loser and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway ready to take over the planet as our heroes assumed a fighting stance nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those like myself who are fans of the game nid even go so far as to say that many folks who didnt know about the game probably enjoyed the movie nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself and they didnt try to overachieve nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes with really cool accompanying music intersperesed with some distracting but ultimately nonintrusive bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot nand as we know the movie was a smashing success at the box office nmortal kombat annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie nshao khan has decided that hes going to take over the earth anyways and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused being trite being silly and being just plain stupid none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought hey that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a real movie now ntoo bad they didnt simply stick with the formula from the first movie ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture but here are the high points n the acting is truly bad nsandra hess playing the sonya blade character is particularly execrable especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie n in one of the worst pieces of miscasting i think ive ever seen james remar plays raiden the god of thunder nin the first movie christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics ni generally like it when actors are cast against type tim tiny lister jr being cast as the president of the u s in the fifth element for example and remar has always been one of my favorite utility actors but hes so totally wrong for this part that he doesnt even have the luxury of amused selfawareness n there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important but then never seen again n there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks including a muddled scene where liu kang robin shou seeks out nightwolf litefoot has a mystical hallucination and then wanders off with jade irina pantaeva nfor these reasons and many others i can only give the movie a 2 n unless youre a huge fan of the games andor the first movie nin that case the following critiques also apply n sandra hess while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson who played sonya blade in the first movie is much more convincing as a fighter nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts and puts together a much more believable fight scene n in the fights each of the characters does at least one thing they do in the game and often more nsonya does her kiss of death jax does his earthquake liu kang does his animality and so on na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely n there arent as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between nsilly silly folks nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mudwrestling match nlame and so obviously sexist even i politically incorrect for the most part noticed and remarked upon it n the special effects are generally better except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their animalities nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games i give this a 5 nyoull probably like it but not nearly as much as you liked the first one n
michael robbins hardball is quite the cinematic achievement nin about two hours we get a glancing examination of ghetto life a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy speeches about never giving up a cache of cute kids including a fat one with asthma a hardluck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic big game where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined nall thats needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich s ni cant wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd nobviously hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball nit stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam nout of solutions he begs his successful corporate friend the always welcome mike mcglone to lend him 5 000 ninstead mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend nreeves who wants to keep his fingers accepts the offer but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely nthe drowsyvoiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs nand maybe just maybe theyll play in the big championship game none of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins summer catch adapted from daniel coyles nonfiction book is that there arent any nthe movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie nthat wouldnt be so bad if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them nmost of the kids time is spent yelling at each other talking in slang and acting surprised ntheres little thats naturally amusing about them as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling nthe worst of the lot is a toughtalking younger player dewayne warren whose sole purpose as the movie unfolds is being an emotional pawn a tactic so utterly despicable i cant find the right words to express myself nthe adults also dont fare well nreeves is impressively uninspiring as the downonhisluck loser nthe character is poorly written but reeves gives another charismafree performance nevery time he speaks he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up nkids are supposed to rally around this guy ndiane lane who costars as reeves obligatory love interest remains a glowing screen presence see my dog skip for better proof nits too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like these kids trust you and they dont trust anyone nthen theres d b nsweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters youve seen before and hope never to see again ni wanted hardball to be good nrobbins varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved ni havent seen robbins goofy ready to rumble in its entirety but i am intrigued that macho man randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions nrobbins obviously needs to go back to his forte making sports movies for guys and not cutesy cuddly pap such as hardball which also manages to annoy and insult the audience nheres hoping that happens in the immediate future n
the disney sticktowhatyoudobest rule states that disneys animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at liveaction kids entertainment they will fail miserably nthis goes double for occasions when they try to make a liveaction adaptation of a popular cartoon remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations nim still trying to forget nthat rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget an insulting despicable and worst of all expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable childrens film nit will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes nits films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects njust as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet his career takes a nosedive to hell with his role as john brown a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him nhe dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush dr brenda bradford joely fisher nbut after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer njohn breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr brendas father ndr brenda has been working on a gadget project which would make a halfman halfmachine superpoliceman to fight crime nfeeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject realizing his dream of becoming a policeman nnow when he says go go gadget insert name of gizmo here he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks bang up bandits and mangle murderers nin the meantime the evil claw rupert everett the man responsible for the murder of the good doctors father is building a gadget of his own a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john browns worst nemesis nclaw has plans of world domination which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile voice of d l nhughley to save humanity from his wrath nstate of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this 90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere nhad they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect nwhat we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal all of the expensive fx amounts to nothing npart of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie ncan kids really admire a hero so goodytwoshoes that he screams hey nyou ran a stop sign nwhile hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle ni think that todays children will respond better to somebody dashing someone ultracool nthey probably receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt nin addition to the more complex complaints above theres also the simple stuff inspector gadget is boring formulaic and achingly implausible ntheres no feeling that the director really cares about his story more than any other film ive seen this year this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line ntheres a popular commercial for sprite but thats irrelevant running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects nit consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious thank god movie called death slug neach executive gleefully presents a different merchandise tiein slug taco nslug on a stick nat the end one of them asks what about the movie nanother answers well we dont have a script yet but we can bang one out by friday nthey probably could have replaced death slug with inspector gadget nthis film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script nits no coincidence that most good childrens entertainment these days comes from animation nanimated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work nthese kinds of films are banged out quicker and a good percentage turn out worthless sloppy and impersonal nthe studios are becoming factories and films their assembled products n 1999 eugene novikov n
in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the reallife incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa nthe twilight murders another one from the series is dealing with the case of gordon kahl played by rod steiger old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u s government nafter being released he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest nwhen the u s marshals come to arrest him it turns out that kahl isnt alone nmany poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist antigovernment beliefs and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that nthat brings fbi on the scene and agent mayberly michael gross is supervising the manhunt nhowever his efforts seem fruitless since kahl still has many supporters some of them even in the local law enforcement nafter betrayed 1988 thriller by costa gavras hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising rightwing extremism in the american northwest and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing when media hype brought rightwingers back into spotlight nuntil that time only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon nunfortunately the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script nsometimes like many american tv movies it creates drama where drama shouldnt be non the other hand film is steadily directed by dick lowry and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl non the other hand michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible nhowever film does deal with potentially thoughtprovoking social and political issues so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldnt be the total waste of time n
it happens every year the days get longer the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their bigbudget blockbusters nthis years crop already seems inferior to that of past summers even 1997s lackluster trio of batman robin the fifth element and the lost world nthe marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla heeere leezerd leezerd which doesnt make me optimistic about future summers ngodzilla is of course based on a series of cult movies translation really bad movies only a few people can tolerate from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turnerowned cable stations nthat this bigbudget remake wont rise above its roots is fairly obvious nthe credits show us the origin of godzilla nin five words nuclear explosion creates giant lizard nsounds like an enquirer headline doesnt it nthe mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable discovery sequence nthis time a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling if that aint a stereotype nwhen he discovers the telltale radar blip npeople die ncut to our protagonist played by matthew broderick nhe makes his first appearance wearing headphones warbling along to singin in the rain nits a nonetoosubtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie nno dice bueller nfrom the beginning poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzillas enormous footprint nevery disaster movie has to have a knowitall scientist and this time broderick is it nas the worlds leading expert on radiated earthworms and wouldnt you love to have that printed on your business card nbroderick is invaluable to the government nhe immediately dispels vicki lewis theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because hey you cant take seriously the intellectual arguments of newsradio cast members nbroderick instead hits the nail on the head announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard n the radiation isnt an anamoly he announces and lightning strikes n i believe this is a mutated abberation he continues and lightning strikes again nits vocabulary lightning you see activated by words of four syllables or more nmeanwhile were introduced to our new york cast headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist maria patillo brodericks former love ngee what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time npoor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer nitalian cameraman hank azaria tells her shes not ruthless enough nice doesnt get you anywhere in this town nits dog eat dog nactually its lizard eat city as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apples core nthe filmmakers provide us with a onenote drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla n i think ive got a bite he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him nyou can guess what happens next nsimilar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city nhearing the rumble of approaching footsteps one new yorker remarks please dont tell me thats another parade nplease dont tell me thats the best line you could come up with nmayor ebert is not pleased nplayed by the principal from head of the class he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option and bickers with his assistant gene ni guess the filmmakers knew theyd be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didnt even bother to kiss ass nthe problem is if youre going to attack siskel and ebert you should at least make it funny ndialogue like didnt we agree that we werent going to have any sweets until after the election nfollowed by back off gene just doesnt work for me nother lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick characters last name and frenchman jean renos inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york ntheres even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses nas the beast heads back into hiding broderick suggests the military lure it out with food ncue twelve dump trucks all dropping fish into a new york intersection n broderick thats a lot of fish nthat ambush fails but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying 50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them nyep godzillas with children which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla nthats until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually like linda tripp ngodzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day so it has a lot of dumb action scenes destructive special effects and shallow subplots nlook no further than patillos betrayal of broderick patillo what have i done animal nwhat have i become and the climactic godzillas nest sequence in madison square garden nthe main difference is independence day was about the experience nit had a real global patriotic element to it and some genuinely fun characters ngodzilla has lots of rain and lightning reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak blockbuster juicy fruit swatch sprint and bumble bee tuna nyes bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla nthat fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie n

after the huge success of the exorcist in 1973 a sequel was inevitable and sadly like most horror fims that make money the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel that makes absolutely no sense at all and to me was extremely pointless wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely nneedless dumb sequel flopped in the box office and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time to which i agree with nto start the story it is four years later and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be now a priest played by richard burton is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again maybe she was good or something nnow they must try to stop this demon from taking over regans body before it is too late nsome of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is linda blair she had no need to revive her character and she is really terrible in this film she brings it down to a lull and in places it seems like it just stops in its place and doesnt go anywhere nlouise fletcher is alright for what its worth but she could have done a lot better than this nthe direction by john boorman is that of a confused stylish nature that i really couldnt figure out nin fact i had no idea what was going on in this film the script was jumbled the plot was jumbled and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad nfor those exorcist fans who havent seen this one i recommend renting it ni actually gave this one a high rating if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins i went easy on it however because of the fact that it has a bit of good direction but nothing else nim not saying i like the film now so dont start going anywhere nbad bad bad movie n
that is unless youre one of those people who have seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters ni can tell you one thing now they gave the entire movie away nwhy someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me nhowever if they hadnt given it away the film wouldve still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter nobviously the producers thought they could remake the deep end of the ocean throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an action drama n double jeopardy offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones who got first billing even though he didnt see to be on screen half as much as judd did nit also offers some genuinely funny clever or fulloftension moments my favorite judd waking up in the coffin but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot nhalf the time im wondering whether im watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised njudging by the beginning end and a huge chunk of the middle i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too nthe movies stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material nimplausible material no less nloose interpretation of one of the amendments aside too many times in the movie i thought that is not possible nthat kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies but not one like double jeopardy that tries to pass itself off as serious drama neverything seems dragged out overplayed nwhen they shouldve kept us in the dark they let the cat out of the bag too early n

godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the who cares about plot summer movie na loose remake of the 1954 classic japanese monster movie godzilla king of the monsters which is itself pretty thin in the story department roland emmerich and dean devlins bigbudget lizardstompsmanhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind nthe script isnt just dumbed down its lobotomized ngodzilla lives and dies on special effects alone npresumably the primary target group for this film is teenage boys the demographic most likely to shell out 7 repeatedly to see the same images of monsterinstigated carnage nthats not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction theyre just not as readily susceptible nthis is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computergenerated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors nstargate was a financial success nindependence day was a runaway hit nand with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tieins before it even opens its virtually guaranteed at least 100 million nnice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a nottooprecocious grade school kid ngodzilla isnt completely without merit although it is close ntheres a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan but it wears off quickly nfrankly while the special effects are competent theyre not all that stunning ntheres nothing new here its jurassic park meets aliens with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure nmaybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computergenerated visuals to the next level ngodzilla never really pushes the envelope preferring to remain within a comfort zone nthe imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass formulaic approach which disallows creativity n how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival nworst of all godzilla isnt even exciting nwith the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end there isnt a sequence in this film that raises the pulse neven the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawnprovoking nindependence day may have been dumb but it was full of adrenaline moments capable of getting the audience involved in the action nin this aspect of its production as in so many others godzilla is lacking nactually part of the problem is that were never sure who were supposed to be rooting for the green monster with an attitude or the paperthin humans trying to stop him nthe plot such as it is can be summed up rather simply nafter sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands godzilla shows up in the big apple nhe does some of the usual tourist things stops by madison square garden visits the chrysler building goes on a walk through central park and takes the subway nin the process he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs but he never has trouble with traffic jams non hand to stop him is an elite u s army unit led by a slightly lessarrogantthanusual military man kevin dunn and a biologist named nick tatopoulos who has a theory about godzilla nin his opinion the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific nin nicks words godzilla is a mutated aberration an incipient creature the first of its kind nas luck would have it nicks old girlfriend audrey maria pitillo is a reporter based at a new york tv station nalong with her cameraman friend animal hank azaria she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla nthen just when the military has rejected nicks theory about why godzilla is in new york a member of the french secret service jean reno recruits him for a special assignment ninstead of stomping around tokyo this time godzilla has chosen new york city nunfortunately manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies independence day deep impact armageddon that its becoming boring nthe whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall nhe could climb the empire state building nat ten times that height godzilla would be more likely to knock it over ngodzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor ntheres an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sitcom material an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nicks last name properly and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel nboth of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film ebert the mayor of new york is played by michael lerner and gene lorry goldman is his campaign manager neberts reelection slogan is not surprisingly thumbs up for new york nthe siskelebert stuff is amusing the first time its used but after a while it grows tiresome nand although the characters dont serve any real purpose they keep popping up ngodzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast nthis is largely because emmerich doesnt want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard nthats not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno arent capable of good performances both have done their share of solid acting in the past but they arent alist names nthen again considering the quality of the writing even pacino and deniro would have been hard pressed to shine nmaria pitillo dear god plays the love interest and hank azaria great expectations is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief nultimately it doesnt really matter what i or any other critic for that matter have to say about the movie ntristar has assumed that godzilla like all selfproclaimed summer event motion pictures is pretty much criticproof nit may also be wordofmouthproof nthose who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say nso when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time its like spitting into the wind nemmerich and devlin are master illusionists waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors nits probably too much to hope that some day moviegoers will wake up and realize that theyve been had n
there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space its just that none of them happen to be actors nthe stars im referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movies outer space the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home nyes in terms of acting the star power is n n nwell more like a falling star nkinda pretty shortlived and pretty much dead nlost in space as if you really didnt know is based on the 60s scifi television series of the same name nits the year 2058 and earths precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population njohn robinson william hurt is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet nearths entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission but nobody whether it be johns family or hired battle pilot don west matt leblanc seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years njohns family consists of his wife maureen mimi rogers his atypical teenage daughter penny lacey chabert his ingenious son will jack johnson and his beautiful scientist daughter judy heather graham ndespite everyones reluctance the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space nunknown to anyone but the audience there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission ndr smith gary oldman has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour and dr smith has reprogrammed a talking robot to destroy robinson family nwhen everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination and now the premise of being lost in space is complete nas for the audience you will likely be lost in boredom by this point wondering if the plot like the jupiter 2 will ever get off the ground nits hard to tell who deserves the most blame the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script nchabert is basically the only one to overdo it sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium nif you like me were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens youre wrong nthats just her normal voice nin yet another example of a friend faltering on the big screen leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming make sense it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod ngraham is a babe thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film nhurt the black hole of excitement sucks up any energy that might have been left nif hurt were available in tablet form he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill njohnson isnt dull hes just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybodys ass all the time nwant an example of how cool this kid can be nhow about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family nhey dont laugh the thing actually listened to the mr rogerswouldbeproud sentiment nbut alas if you thought a character couldnt be much worse there was rogers as the epitome of generic or mother as she was known nwhy hire an actress nthey couldve had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it nnow that wouldve had some pizzazz nlost in space luckily doesnt suffer in every single category that it could have nthe special effects are crisp clear and at least mildly captivating unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse nunfortunately oldman is locked away for most of the film giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy nwhile the special effects are pleasing to the eye they are nothing you couldnt find in most modern scifi films ncontact for example far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination nlost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art with numerous contradictions the time travel aspect was horribly flawed wooden and corny acting worse dialogue and an ending so disappointing youd be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens nthen again with an ending like this film has its obvious a sequel is already being considered nwhat an awful note to end on knowing there could be more of this in a year or two nthe attempt to be family oriented is commendable but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups nwell danger potential movie goers ndanger nthis movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity n
at one point in this movie there is a staging of an opera that goes completely wrong nbut one member of the crowd stands up and cheers thinking the performance was planned and applauding it for their efforts nthats dirty work in a nutshell na very different kind of movie nthis is not a movie that i can easily review nthe critic in me analyzes the structure plot acting characters n n and ntells me this movie is terrible nbut the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing nthis movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie nits a one note concept nmitch and sam need 50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients nrealizing they are very good at revenge plots they open a revenge for hire business eventually running afoul of a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald who after roles in happy gilmore and veronicas closet seems typcast in this role who sends them to destroy a building that mitch learns is the home of his girlfriends grandmother thus leading them to plot against the rich businessman on the night of the grand opening of a new opera house nfirst the critic in me nthe plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way nheres the catch nnone of the characters are sympathetic ntheyre all selfish jerks who dont care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever they want nthe jokes are juvenile crude appealing to the worst elements in people ntheres jokes about prostitutes the homeless beastiality anal sex ntheres even a subplot thats developed it seems only to make jokes about infidelity and incest nand i loved watching it ni was a huge fan of norm macdonalds sarcastic tothepoint comedy on saturday night live and this movie is an hour and a half of it nnorm macdonald takes a joke strips it to the core and tells it like it is with a dry wit nlike the scene were he and his friend are learning the ropes at a new construction job nthe foreman goes over the basics which mitch and sam dont understand nhow do they get out of it nby admiting they lied on their resumes and dont know a thing about construction nand surprise they get fired nthe characters are incredibly meanspirited ntheres a father whos loud and obnoxious a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his fathers condition by saying if i were a gambling man id put a lot of money on death nthe businessman cole who always has his dog spunky and does who knows what with it nand then theres mitch and sam who thinking they can get 50000 by destroying a building ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents n too bad we have to do it mitch says nheres a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up where you see every punchline coming where every spot profanity could be used and then is used nat least the film is honest and makes no mistake that it is anything more than idiotic nbut at least it isnt dull and it isnt predictable nand thats the way it should be nits sketch comedy and if youre a fan of norm macdonald youll love it nthe jokes are crude the characters are mean to the core the attitude of the movie is that it just doesnt care nif you dont like norm macdonald or stupid movies then you probably wont like this one nthe jokes are crude the characters are mean to the core the attitude of the movie is that it just doesnt care nso before seeing this one tune your mindset and prepare for a slew of norm macdonald humor gay animal sex prison rape jokes uncaring characters and one last performance from chris farley nthe critic in me says but i give it an 8 ni just couldnt stop laughing n
if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films i might say that i review movies that dont look particularly good because im doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it nif that were true i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads shay casey seeing bad movies so you dont have to nbut i know thats bunkyoure going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say nso i have to tell the truth every once in a while i get a nasty masochistic urge to see a bad movie nyou know the feeling when youre sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly nsometimes i think thats why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies ever nadmit it sometimes you like seeing bad movies nso do i nso i saw supernova ntruth be told supernova wasnt quite as bad as i thought it might be nmaybe i just felt sorry for the actors or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadnt started tinkering with the directors walter hill final cut causing him to want his name removed nmaybe im becoming a softy nin any case i didnt find supernova as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe nbut its still bad nthe film takes place aboard the medical space vessel nightingale nthe crew includes captain a j nmarley robert forster his new second officer nick vanzant james spader head medical officer kaela evers angela bassett medical technicians yerzy penalosa lou diamond phillips and danika lund robin tunney and computer technician benj sotomejor wilson cruz nthere are some attempts at characterization but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction which puts kaela on edge yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissyfaces at each other every five minutes and benj apparently gay is in love with the computer apparently female ndont expect any more explanation because you wont get it nanyway the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent nduring the dimension jump i think thats what its called but dont hold me to it the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal peter facinelli is brought on board nhe calls himself troy larson making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with nthen a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening nhave you seen alien nhave you seen event horizon a lame movie in its own right ngood nthen youve seen supernova npostproduction cuts or not there is nothing original about this screenplay and nothing unpredictable either nafter all no ones going to think for a second that troy wont turn out to be a villain nbut the bigger problem with supernova is that it can t just stick to the simple plot its afforded nnumerous rewrites the script may be credited to three people but its a gross underestimate have crammed this lean 90minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped nwas there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ndid the ships computer learn something about humanity nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him nand just what does the films title signify if anything nas far as i can tell it refers to a very small plot detail that isnt developed just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense nfor some reason every person in this film keeps having sex nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes nbassett and spaders characters start off hating each other nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later theyre engaging in some hankypanky nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship of course both female crew members will fall in love with him nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut nthe most prominent example however may be the fact that when the film starts there are no opening credits nfurthermore the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits nmaybe thats why the films title is mentioned twice during the end credits right between james spader and robert forster nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie youre seeing lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene with littletono introduction to any of the characters or situations nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes you know where they explain things and just went from point a to point b point a danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby npoint b tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing ndoesnt make sense nsince i didnt understand anything about these characters motivations did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them onebyone and he does knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes nnot a whit nits a shame because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do nthey dont find it nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces nsexual tension nmore like constipation nmaybe theyre just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice nnot that we ever find out who that is mind you nthe climax of their relationship taking place in a transport pod is probably the films biggest foreheadslapper nas troy peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected nhe s awfully onenote but its not as if hes given any more notes to work with nthe rest of the cast does even less ntunney stands around looking cute then scared nphillips broods ncruz flirts with the computer nthen they all die and a star blows up or something but i really wasnt paying much attention by then n supernova is pretty awful but im cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got nthats it nif you expect it to be good for whatever reasons you may have youll probably hate it more than i will neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive nothing you haven t seen before and suffice to say the script isnt going to save the film nhonestly though what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym nit usually results in a bad movie and thats what supernova is n
the original babe was my favorite movie of 1995 a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience nbeing a surprise commercial and critical success it had no marketing tieins which limited its final take nthus babe 2 arrives with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1 nplush dolls vending machines hawking tshirts and macys thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday moneygrubbing ntoo late nthis is a sad review to write because babe 2 not only does not live up to the original but it doesnt even come to a fraction of it ni shouldnt expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors magic but this film tries too hard and loses its charm nconsider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity unaware that his car is in neutral nimagine with me if you will screams jamie kennedy explaining the rules for sequels like babe 2 n 1 there must be more talking animals n 2 there must be more slapstick comedy n 3 there must be more songs for those mice to sing thats cute n 4 keep the story cards to break up the action thats cute too even though the pig gets wise made no sense given the context of that story partition n 5 there must be action however illogical that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to the baaramewe secret code the thatll do pig nthatll do nnow throw in the limitations a james cromwell now a hot commodity has limited time on the set or maybe he didnt approve of the script n b christine cavanaugh the voice of the original babe demands more money 200 000paltry considering the 80 million budget nout ne g ndaily comes in with noticable results n c george miller the director is more wellknown for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment not for kiddie fare and no he didnt direct that andre film in 94 n d the special effects are impressive but limited nbabe talks but most of the time from a single shot repeated over and over again n babe is center screen looking straight into the camera with a happy smirkregardless of whether hes happy or scared or tired nseason now with the original elements which as we will find out are straight from the screenwritingishell bin n i change the venue into the big city nthis has been praised as wildly original nexcuse me didnt home alone do this several years ago nhow about the muppets neven the bad news bears travelled to tokyo nsorry nno dice nside note to give the city a fairytale look george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the worlds great cities and yes it is impressive nbut this too is overused repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions nand for the most part babe remains in the hotel n ii given the limitations of cromwell the human element is taken over by the boss wife played by magda szubanski nstretch nshes not a lead actresstype shes not funny enough in her physical comedy and shes simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls n have her arrested falsely on drug charges nhave her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes nhave her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner ni was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in ni am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film the violence the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge head submerged underwater neven the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it as the brothers grimm have demonstrated nno my problem is with the story or lack thereof nbabe is sent out to save the hoggett farm but once in the city that story is forgotten nbeing a goodnatured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice but other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull what did babe actually do nwithout giving the ending away the farm is saved from a leftfield quirk that had nothing to do with the pig nspeaking of pig or pigpigpigpigpig nthe word pig is so overused had they changed it to an expletive and had the pig be al pacino i could have been watching scarface nthis is screenwriting nfurther i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups nhad it been a cartoon and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd maybe my reaction would have been softened nbut to farmer hoggett nhis wife nan elderly mickey rooney nmuch too irreverent n quick nsplice those singing mice into those scenes nthe film isnt a colossal failure ni did like glenne headleys schmoozy chimpanzee ni liked the pink poodle nthe dog on the cart who momentarily thinks hes in dog heaven nand a weird looking guy who may have been doublycast as an airport employee and a judge nbut most of the time i was looking down in boredom or in embarrassment over the hackedup script nthem singing mice those chapter partitions the proficient acting of the animals none of these can compensate for a story nlet me spoil the final scene farmer hoggett looks at pig proud says thatll do pig nthatll do nthats it nhope i didnt ruin it for you nbut tell me this what the heck did that pig do n

 have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming nobviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment and so to finish us utterly they have now released urban legends final cut nthis is another scream like feature consisting merely from the recycled materials of ripoffs from the most pointless movies of all time namy jennifer morrison is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do nbut just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious universitys film program where each years best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize a virtual oneway ticket to hollywood success she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese loretta devine whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines nsoon enough fake and real blood starts to flow and amy is being chased around by scary killer while her cast and crew get slain one by one nis the culprit the original urban legends murderer just some random psycho na member of the faculty one of her competitors for the hitchcock or is there something even more stupid going on nthis is another one of those tiring pointless teen slasher flicks neither scary funny or interesting nit simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain nthe body counts and screams continue to grow as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly nin fact watching films like that after having watched scary movie is impossible keeping a serious face nseveral times i tried to prevent myself from laughing without succeeding nand then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing nits the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century nhow many times must we tolerate the same clich s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth nit has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them nthey are the most stupid meaningless predictable and soulless films in existence nhowever director john ottman manages to make urban legends final cut into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre nwhat was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in scream ottman takes seriously nfor that reason alone it is worth a look just to realize how bad a movie can be nits tough to find comparisons for such an achievement and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect neven movies like lost in space and mission to mars seem spectacular in its shadow nwe have not seen such waste of t nime and resources since showgirls 1995 nno matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production i came up with nothing except the way the killer was dressed nhere i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and mariesylvie deveu that have wisely replaced the well known screammask with a very elegant fencing mask njennifer morrison stir of echoes is all right and the other actors best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script nin fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film with the exception of its screenplay is its portray of film schools nif these graduates will be the directors of the future then hollywoods golden days are over nrumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment nlets just hope and pray that its just an urban legend n

the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending nwatching one of these movies everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise nwhen the film ends there is a moment of confusion then recollection then some more confusion then possibly a second viewing for clarification nthis is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more ngood surprises make movies fun to watch nthen there are the bad twists nyou either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie im talking about you reindeer games or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid nscrewed perfectly suits the latter description nwhat starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on nby the writers of man on the moon and the people vs nlarry flynt scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing nwhoops nscrewed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments nnorm macdonald stars as willard filmore a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich old insidious boss miss crock elaine stritch nwhen he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day willard is convinced by his best friend rusty dave chapelle to kidnap crocks beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars ntoo excited to pay any attention the hapless losers plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home nnow crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends realizing they can make even more money decide to stage the fake kidnapping nof course everything that could go wrong does nthe first fortyfive minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad nbut the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear nthe more idiotic these characters get the more reckless the script becomes nat one point i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters no you idiot nim not just talking about willard and rusty who were extremely annoying im also talking about the cops in this film na monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys headed by murder ones daniel benzali were just too clueless to forgive nthey give real cops bad names nalso poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days nlooking almost identical to his penguin in batman returns every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief nhe just didnt belong in this movie nmacdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was gross out humor is certainly not his forte nif youre a fan of norm macdonalds other chaotic comedy dirty work you might actually love this nearsequel notherwise dont get screwed out of your hardearned money n
 the following review contains spoilers n please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie n chuck dowling the jacksonville film journal ni wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997s batman and robin napparently no one heard my words noh how i wish you had heard them noh how i wish someone had stopped him nbecause hes done it again nthe plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale nin fact it was everything that 8mm is not nin the opening minutes of 8mm we see private detective tom welles nicolas cage working on a case for a prestigious member of the u s government nkeep this fact in mind cage is trusted with an important case which he solves nhe returns home to his wife and new daughter and even finds time to rake his yard keep that in mind too its important as well nhes hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery nafter her husbands death she comes across a film in his private safe nit appears to be snuff film a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera nthe woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film nso he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film nthe main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless nwelles is actually selected for the case by the old womans lawyer anthony heald an actor who always plays the same type of character that being a bad guy nwhen you first see him your first instinct is that hes behind the whole thing nthe choice of casting does the film in nthen as welles begins his investigation at times we will see a shadowy figure following him nthe only person it could possibly be is the lawyer or someone sent by the lawyer because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet nso your first instinct has now been confirmed nthen when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced in one of those ridiculous since were going to kill you anyway why not tell you the whole thing moments nbut earlier when we see welles being hired for the case hes told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended nhuh nalso when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing his main goal is to get the film back nso why did he give it up in the first place nthe lawyer had the film the whole time then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film nits totally absurd nand this is the screenwriter of seven nlate in the film theres a confrontation between all the main characters and after a struggle one of the characters guns ends up underneath a car ncage who has been handcuffed to a bed is rapidly trying to get to his gun which is on a table njames gandolfinis character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of suspense nyou see the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car hes trying to reach it from and so instead of going around the car to the other side where he can easily reach it he just keeps stretching ngo around to the other side of the car nthis goes on for minutes nthen after cage gets his gun gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car nboy schumacher is really really getting on my nerves ni think the final straw would be when cage returns home devastated by everything that hes seen on this case and then is no longer able to rake his lawn nwe actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard nother things that bugged me about 8mm one would be the music if you can call it that nwhenever the score starts up it sounds like techno music and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it nawful decision there joel nanother is cages performance nat this point hes capable of a wide range of performances either good or bad nfor 8mm he delivers a very wooden one and only shines when hes interacting with joaquin phoenix who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case nyoure capable of much better mr cage nnow as for you mr schumacher nim starting to doubt if youre capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema nr n
okay okay nmaybe i wasnt in the mood to watch a mindless action movie i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii even while admitting that it wasnt as good as the others nhowewer the latest segal picture didnt look that bad and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash nboy was i wrong nin the first half of the movie we are already assaulted with segals acting he is not simply wooden he is like a wall gratuitous violence an incredible plot sexist and even more gratuitous nudity and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes nby the end it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers nnot once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense nof course in movies like these there must be a sidekick and a love interest nin these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model in the movie which only functions as a supposed comic relief by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie noh of course she appears naked from the waist up and of course segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship they did not even seem to be interested in each other ni have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie noften the villain saves the movie unfortunately the villains here are cartoonish stupid and unfunny unmenacing nhow many movies have psycho exspecial forces bad guys ntoo many ni was able to predict the action all throughout the movie including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him the scene where we are shown the heros superiors are stupid the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand etc nsimply said this is moviemaking by the numbers boring and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience nmy recommendation if you go see it bring a watch nyoull be looking at it for most of the movie nmy nrent die hard nread a book nstare at the sky ndo not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid nthe real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen once again dragged in by my friends which by the way liked the movie halfheartedly nthey probably like wrestling too n

chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from you either find his helium voice crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying ni think i fall into the former category im one of the few who thought his turn in the fifth element as a prancing princelike deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating but his new vehicle money talks just doesnt do him service ntucker is good in the movie and this is the kind of film that if people see it could make him a big star but hes also really the only thing good about the movie nin fact if you see money talks it should shock you beyond recognition that two of toy story s writers penned the sloppy script ntuckers role here is that of franklin hatchett a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell charlie sheen nafter being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard gerard ismael nbut villards thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist franklin is allowed to escape as well but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that for some reason or another is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo nthe local media mistakenly puts the prison breakout blame on franklin which is where james comes back into the picture nhe makes a deal to protect franklin if in turn franklin gives him an exclusive interview nthis means james must present his new friend in the stickiest of situations a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace heather locklear also attended by her uberrich parents veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino nand of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james n this aint no buddy movie claim the print ads nyeah right nactually for the better part of oh 20 minutes it appears money talks has the momentum to cover entertaining ground and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker nthis is tuckers first leading role and if you imagine a slightly lankier africanamerican jim carrey with a reliance on wild rrated raunch rather than pg13 physical comedy you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role nbut you realize all too quickly that tuckers overstated liveliness is the only thing money talks has going for it nand a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make nits all too easy to pick out everything wrong with money talks nthe plot is recycled buddybuddy comedythriller tripe that seemed overused even when nothing to lose employed it last month neverything is paintbynumbers especially the los angeles coliseum finale which finds not one not two but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers nthe villains as many as there are are dull ncertain story elements are too coincidental nand too much of the films dramatic agenda is played too straight na scene where grace confronts james after learning franklins true identity you brought a killer into my parents house nis extremely silly nyou get the picture nobviously i did not have a pleasant experience at money talks nbut the people around me appeared to be having a riproaring good time one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health nbut tucker at least for me is a pretty funny guy and aces the movies best scene where franklin passes himself off as vic damones son at james and graces engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics ntuckers audience and he does have one will probably like money talks nthose who he irritates however will have a more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails n
synopsis sonny koufax adam sandler is a rich childish angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa kristy swanson nin a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin jon stewart and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian cole and dylan sprouse while kevin is on an overseas trip nunder sonnys supervision julian soon learns to lie to women tell people how he wipes his ass throw tantrums and scream for his god damned treats nself centered julian breaks a school classmates arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong nmeanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk food toys and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform nnot surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonnys incompetent supervision and this leads to a custody battle nopinion its a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior nthats the essence of big daddy nbut theres a bigger issue involved marketing nmovies that are rated pg and pg13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below non tv film clips advertise these movies as familyfriendly hit comedies nthen when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment nfolks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation nto many american mothers theres probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a womans ice cold tits n
claire danes giovanni ribisi and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists but theyre just about the only palatable element of the mod squad a lamebrained bigscreen version of the 70s tv show nthe story has all the originality of a block of wood well it would if you could decipher it the characters are all blank slates and scott silvers perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come nby sheer force of talent the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever theyre on screen but the mod squad is just a secondrate action picture with a firstrate cast n
when considering david finchers latest film the game four words come to mind n dont believe the hype nthis michael douglas vehicle from the director of seven isnt nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe nthe film draws us in with an intriguing concept aided no doubt by the riveting trailer where a jaded millionaire douglas is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy nthis isnt simply virtual reality nthis is real life with a deadly twist non his 48th birthday nicholas van orton douglas is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother conrad sean penn nconrad has a special birthday present for his brother nhe hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services n they make your life fun conrad tells him nnicholas humors his brother telling him hell call but its clear he has no time for any foolish fantasy roleplaying as he calls it nthen for reasons that are never really made clear nicholas decides to go to crs and see what theyre all about nhe ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have nnevertheless when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client the weird things start happening nof course when weve only covered about 30 minutes of screen time what else should we expect ndouglas has built his modern career around playing powerful violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands none of those films basic instinct came from the creative minds of writer joe eszterhas and director paul verhoeven nthe premise of the game is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film total recall nin that case the premise was implanting someone elses memories as a way to enhance ones own life through a dream vacation nyet in both films the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience nwe live the adventure along with the protagonist reacting to each twist and turn nin theory the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isnt nall we can do is hang on until the end of the ride when the truth is finally revealed nnow for those of you who forgot let me say this again n dont believe the hype n the game is not a thrilling roller coaster ride nas a suspensethriller it doesnt do much but spin in circles nby the third reel i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot nis it any wonder douglas wont be able to resist the charms of a mysterious potentially lifethreatening blonde ever heard of glenn close nno well how about sharon stone nthought so nif anything in this film surprises you at all i would guess you havent seen that many films nthere is no suspense here ntrust me i looked hard to find some ni had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations nfincher aims for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas nthere are those that might say the game is not intended to be viewed literally ni would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film nthe film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues nthere is a moment early in the film where van orton realizing his game has begun smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out whos in on the whole thing nhe is charged by his paranoia nhe is looking at the world through new eyes nit is the last thoughtprovoking moment in the film nfrom there on the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us nany significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device nat the outset were told each game is tailored to the individual nultimately this game is supposed to work like a crucible trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire proving his soul nyet as douglas endures his personal gauntlet were given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is ni wanted to like this film more than i did ni look at it as just anothergreat idea poorly realized ni can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didnt mean we were seeing what was really happening nbryan singers the usual suspects for one a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas nalso there is the underrated jacobs ladder with tim robbins a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism nhere are two examples of films that dont simply manipulate for manipulations sake nthere are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place none major issue that comes up in the game is whether or not the whole illusion is just a highly sophisticated con game nwell i can tell you right now after youve spent your 7 dollars you may be asking yourself the same thing n
8mm is not going to enlighten your day nits a dark grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence nnot only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess youll require a lot of patience as well nnicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late nhe wore a bizarre getup and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality ncage plays private investigator tom welles praised for his secrecy and reliability nat home welles is a family man with a wife catherine keener and a small daughter to take care of nhis new assignment is a bizarre one the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husbands safe nthe film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man until the girl is brutally murdered nor so it seems nwelles of course begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth nand the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case the more he gets in over his head nhe hires an adult book store clerk named max california joaquin phoenix to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography nmax knows what welles is getting himself into and explains you dance with the devil the devil dont change nthe devil changes you nthese turn out to be very wise words n8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution nthe setup is slick and well played as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her nthis is where everything goes awry nalthough director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the real world he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula neverything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects nalthough it had enormous potential the third act of 8mm is a total bust leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control ncage is the films sole flame of energy nhis performance is actually believable but soon the directors demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation nstill youve got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand nwelles trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker played convincingly by peter stormare who is notorious for the hardesthitting snuff films in the industry nthis is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killerlike phase in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film nhe tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing chris bauer and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie nwritten by andrew kevin walker 8mm dissipates into a poor mans seven with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece nfurthermore what has become of joel schumacher nthe director has recently experienced a major drought slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop batman and robin anyone nthis putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side n
synopsis al simmons topnotch assasin with a guilty conscience dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell nmaking a pact with malebolgia a chief demon there simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn a general in hells army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives chains and a morphing cape nsullen wise cogliostro and flatulating wisecracking violator vy for spawns attention ncomments when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics where he had made a name for himself as a firstrate comic book penciller on the spiderman titles to join the newlyformed creatorowned image comics a new comic book legend was born spawn nmcfarlanes spawn immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s nmcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max nthe early spawn issues brilliantly capture mcfarlanes genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing nwith the popularity of spawn and the success of the current warner bros s batman film franchise a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn nin the summer of 1997 hence new line cinema released spawn a liveaction film based on the groundbreaking series nthis topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book like me numbed by how much spawn misses the mark nwhat happened nwhy is spawn so bad ntodd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo ni dont think however that his presence necessarily hurt or helped the film ni place the blame in part on the recent hollywood trend fueled by public demand apparently for special effects blowout movies utilizing the latest computer technology nthese films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else character plot dialogue etc spawn reflecting this trend shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics nhardly a minute goes by in this film without fires explosions knives and chains appearing out of nowhere glowing eyes or constantly transforming demons na lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid dont get me wrong but because the script and cast arent engaging spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper the surface may capture the eye but nothing exists underneath nspawns translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level nmcfarlanes spawn was a tortured hero na mercenary by trade al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda nhaving died and journeyed to hell he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda nsimmons however discovers that his memories are fragmented his body a creepy mess and his wife married ndespite his sometimes violent nature readers couldnt help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld nspawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so nwhen the characters are developed they seem absurd rather than touching nthe cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world do not help matters nspawn in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman also unwisely spends too much time on a villain the violator batman favored the joker over batman njohn leguizamo like jack nicholson in batman receives top billing in the cast as the violator michael jai white al simmons spawn is second ni ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator nthe film however spends so much time on the violators offensive antics that they grate on the nerves napparently meant to be the comic relief in the film as nicholson was in batman especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn the violators lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny leaving the audience wishing he would leave nleguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role but he is seen far too often in the film nmichael jai white a relative newcomer to theatrical releases seems to be an appealing actor and he handles his role adequately but we see little of him without various masks on nmore time needed to be spent on whites character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings na special note should be made about martin sheen as the overthetop obnoxious evil general wynn neasily the hammiest performance in the movie its hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much after all he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now nsheens excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film nmany other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down nmtvstyle jerky inyourface editing is one of them nflames for example roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting ncogliostro unlikely wannabe guide for spawn serves as a poor narrator for the film nhe goofily tells the audience at one point that how much of spawns humanity is left remains to be seen as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another nthe music finally assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue nloud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes nto be fair however marilyn mansons long hard road out of hell effectively compliments spawns return to earth while filter and the crystal methods cant you trip like i do proves a surprisingly fitting theme song nfor as good a comic book as it is spawn did not spawn a good movie nspawn instead suffers from too much pomp and circumstance and too little plot and character development nit receives two stars for its technically welldone special effects nmany other films though have equal if not superior special effects and are much better nrated pg13 spawn seems more violent than many rrated movies and probably wouldnt be appropriate for the very young n
capsule the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smiths films gets their own movie nthe gags are sporadically funny nit is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and antigay jokes nthe plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team nthe little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film nsadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching nthis feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night n and it turns out he had very good reasons n low 0 4 to 4 na film needs a plot nit needs characters for empathy value nit needs a story and an emotional center nif a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are nkevin smith has now made two satisfying films clerks and chasing amy nwith dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp npeter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled nbut getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smiths fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it nhis remaining two films mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience njay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes penis jokes flatulence jokes film pastiches and injokes nhow funny the jokes are will be a subjective call nfor me the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny nthere was not enough cleverness or variety nit is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay npenis jokes work only so many times nshowing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags nthey were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british postwar films including dead of night the lady vanishes and passport to pimlico njay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners nas the series wore on they had larger and larger parts nin jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads njay and silent bob played by jason mewes and kevin smith are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks nthis leaves them at loose ends nthey are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie nthey decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash nso it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way nthe film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood nthe problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny nsilent bob being silent can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his nthis makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have njay has to be the comic nhe could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive nthe problem is that he is not sufficiently funny nhe is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair nso jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team ntheir starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen beforesometimes just minutes before nlike dogma before it but definitely not like chasing amy this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie ncertainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving nthey are excuses for gags many of which still fall flat nit is dogma without any of the humorous theological content nthe film does not offer much to an adult audience ni rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale n

as with any genx mtv movie like last years dead man on campus the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points sex and football nthose two items wrapped in a guiltypleasure package are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially but sales will decline for two reasons nfirst the football sequences are nothing new nor can they be the sports genre isnt mainstream and its been retread to death nsecond the sex is just bad ndespite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the allnight stripclub party theres nothing even remotely tantalizing nthe acting is mostly mediocre not including the fantastic jon voight ncultivating his usual sliminess voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer nkilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes twentytwo conference championships and two state titles in thirty years this year he plans to make it twentythree nunfortunately when his star quarterback lance harbor paul walker goes down for the count hes got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon james van der beek nmoxon leads the team through its last four games and then must cope with his newfound stardom the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie amy smart and other temptations that abound in footballcrazy west canaan nmost regions of the country are not nearly as footballcrazy as texas and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most nsimilarly the set design is wrong for a high school setting the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms radio headsets which never seem to work however and instead require coaches to signal plays manually and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer nthese elements as well as the heavy drinking and carousing might be more appropriate on a college campus but mtvs core audience is the high school demographic nthis focus is further emphasized by the casting james van der beek of tvs dawsons creek is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero although he never manages to do anything with the role nother stars are similarly young and unmemorable ntheres not much that goes right about varsity blues and theres not much to like about it either neverything herein has already been done and if it hasnt the movie manages to botch it one way or another nthis is certainly missable n
warner brothers rated pg13 mild violence sexual situations 132 minutes ndirector luis mandoki nscreenplay gerald di pego from the novel by nicholas sparks ncast kevin costner robin wrightpenn paul newman illeana douglas robbie coltrane jesse james john savage nreview by geoff berkshire nim not an overly cynical guy nthere have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years nhowever i have my limits and i also have standards nthis brings us to the subject at hand message in a bottle the big ticket romance that warner brothers unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentines day nthe story what little of it that there is involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne robin wrightpenn dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason jesse james nduring a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean nthe letter written to a mystery woman named catherine instantly captivates her nupon her return theresa shares it with her best friend lina illeana douglas her boss charlie robbie coltrane and the entire city of chicago the newspaper publishes an article about it nit turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake kevin costner and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down nhe turns out to have a colorful father paul newman but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing nthis is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship nof course she doesnt tell him that she found his letter she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later preferably right after they first make love nthis way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened nthe discovery of the message and garrets discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film ntheres a truly lame subplot about garrets relationship with his dead wifes family he gets into a bar fight with her brother played by john savage and then the necessary tearjerking ending na fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel nthe actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced and unintentionally humorous sequences filmed since nwell since costners the postman 1997 nmessage in a bottle is one slow moving film nlast year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this nthey also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work nmessage in a bottle has a decent enough cast but theyre fighting the material all the way and losing badly ncostner and especially wrightpenn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring nthey also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry nthe supporting players are given very little to do nthe reliable douglas is particularly wasted nold pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film na confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played nhowever too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are nthe film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story ngabriel yared who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient 1996 and city of angels 1998 with his scores overdoes it a bit here ncaleb deschanels camera makes everything look a little too beautiful ndo the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly nthe editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times nthe real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego nworking from a best selling novel by nicholas sparks which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times nits strict adherence to clich s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer 1998 nthere simply isnt an original scene in this film nthe dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking nthis is director mandokis first film since when a man loves a woman 1994 the solid meg ryanandy garcia romance nhes simply going through the motions with this nmessage in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come 1998 as one of the most misguided romances of the decade n
well heres a distasteful thoroughly amateurish item that surprisingly was actually a boxoffice hit at the time of its release nafter just viewing the film for the first time my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie nit is cheap idiotic unfunny and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was nat least some smut would have livened things up a bit n porkys tells the story if you can call it that of four clueless high school buddies pee wee dan monahan billy mark herrier tommy wyatt knight and mickey roger wilson whom desperately want to get laid nwomen for the most part are a mystery to them and in this movie they are to the audience as well since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet ntheir plan is sidetracked however when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porkys which they are able to get into using fake ids nafter they pay the manager onehundred bucks for three hookers they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building nfor these four teenage guys this means war on porkys n porkys ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level nas a teenage sexromp it is not wild or amusing enough nas a comedy all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat nas a look back at the 1950s it is something i suspect most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave nand as a revenge movie it is a crushing bore none of the most offensive things about porkys is how jawdroppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers nthe four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters and we learn very little about them except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool nthat sure is revealing information nthe female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark nthe women are all treated as objects or comedy props rather than real people nfor example the two gym teachers mrs balbricker nancy parsons and honeywell kim cattrall only have one purpose and that is to be made fun of nmrs balbricker is a gruff noholdsbarred overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness and in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog nthere is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses even though i have the suspicion they are not but one thing is for sure they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny only humiliating nto prove how outoftouch this socalled comedy is compare it to other more serious 80s films about teenagers and it looks even worse in comaprison nany of the john hughes pictures such as 1984s sixteen candles or 1985s the breakfast club put porkys at an even greater shame nthose films actually dealt with serious teen matters but remained a great deal funnier thanks to their bright and truthful writing nand heck if porkys wanted to be a teenage sex movie id take 1982s fast times at ridgemont high or 1982s the last american virgin over this any day of the week ndirector bob clark is not a bad director ntwo years after he made porkys he directed the nostalgic holiday classic a christmas story ni would forgive him for this misfire in fact if it wasnt for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay njust the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in porkys n

synopsis cromagnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion nreluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggystyle ayla grows up to become a blond feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate ncomments allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies nshe proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the scifi classic blade runner nthe clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title nnot even her starring role in this turkey unfortunately can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese nits so uniquely bad a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries and miserably fails to be serious that its oddly fascinating nthe ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed wanting to see how this dud plays out nthe clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m auel nto this day the book possesses a loyal cult following ni remember a dear friend of mine had a dogeared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the socalled dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother ni have never read this book but i sure hope its 10 000 times better than its film adaptation nif not then im at a complete loss to explain its popularity nthe clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene na young ayla looking much like drew barrymore in e t ntramps about in the woods nwith her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her the audiences expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered nwhat follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up aylas mother a blonde with fur pants er nleggings ntearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera well nas the earthquake slowly recedes na hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch but the screaming sixyearold manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven ni wont detail the story any further this seems enough to illustrate my point nthis movie is really stupid nit never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief nalso the obvious comparison between the appearance of cromagnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston nthe movie doesnt just suggest this message it whacks the message into the audience with a twobyfour na blond gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs nshes of the new people theyre of the old people with the memories nyep nwe get it nwe get it nthe clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best makeup which surprises me nthe movie depends upon a lot of makeup obviously but much of it is unconvincing nas stated before daryl hannah is daryl hannah here she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time nthe rest of the characters have dark makeup of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt nthe facepainting thats occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind nthis movie also suffers from its new age trappings nmaybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 but now it sounds dated and cliched like poorly conceived elevator music nadd to this the films fauxmysticism including spirit animals and dream visions and a narrator who sounds like a psychic youd expect to hear on a 1900 number and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious nthe clan of the cave bear is rated r though its probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films ive seen in quite a while nit contains several scenes of sex sans nudity nthe violence mostly consists of hunting scenes nthe funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear nthe bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about nalthough this may sound gratuitous im sure its so cheesy that it probably wont bother most people nthe clan of the cave bear is a bad movie nhowever as i wrote at the beginning of this review it does have the distinction of originality ntypically when i think of bottomofthebarrel films dealing with early man fantasy movies involving dinosaurs who did not exist at the same time as man and raquel welch come to mind nthe clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that though its so bad the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ni have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version however im only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie ni shudder to think that it could be otherwise n
 houston we have a serious problem nafter making mission impossible brian de palma has a lot to live up to nby making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew he hopes to reach the modern audience nand the possibilities are certainly there but the result is a great disaster nstarting in a near future with a prologue copied from apollo 13 de palma slowly builds up his story nthe human race has already set foot on mars na research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened nthis is basically the whole plot nso its hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours nbut de palma manages to do that nit is not a very good achievement nas we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space the hardest thing to do is stay awake nthe films major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is ndavid mamets dialogue while trying to seem natural is distant and simply fake nde palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot nthe result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubricks 2001 a space odyssey apollo 13 and godzilla nto make time pass the creators have inserted several refreshing scientific details that would not convince a halfcrazed frog nit consists of multiple copies and direct rippoffs from several great science fiction films and stories nwhen it finally presents an almost original idea it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity ni cant even call this film predictable since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this nsometimes it gets so cheesy that youll start laughing when youre supposed to cry and cry when youre supposed to laugh nyoull see enormous sandstorms hear mysterious sounds and last but not least on this constantly surprising tour youll see an alien nits really hard to find comparisons to such an experience and i know that ive never said that before i thought i never would but lost in space is actually better nthats an achievement in itself ndirector brian de palma has stroke gold with untouchables that became an instant american classic nit is for this film that he will be remembered while all his other failures will be forgotten nhell live to fight another day ni send the actors my condolences since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters nand both the cinematography production design and art direction are very decent nit is because of the achievement of 254 people that i rate this film 210 nunfortunately their hard work was in vain nif you have problems with insomnia i recommend you this film nif youre not asleep within the first half hour consult your doctor n
 american pie alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summers attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute coupleness and zany comedy nits about an a student biggs as paul who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora suvari a ditzy heroinchic goth chick who has no ambition or selfrespect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like hickboy paul is nso weve got a fishoutwater formula mixed with meetcute romantic comedy which ideally should make for a good movie nunfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction by clueless auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film nthese characters are totally unrealistic and unbelievable its as if everyone under age 30 is a stoned raver ntheres no background or details to anyone or anything its just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each other nnot to mention the story itself which is virtually nonexistant and contains so many plotholes its like swiss cheese neven the basic editing is bad nif youre looking for a romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny ni saw this in a packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all nif youve seen the commericials youve seen all the funny parts which are all from the first five minutes n
theres a good and timely story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first a new movie about the abuses of our prison system nwith a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy this expose would offer something rare to recent american moviesa point of view nbut director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious often nauseating camera movements and slick mtv style lighting and editing are far more important ntheres not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling nand everything suffers nchristian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate respectively nafter spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape bacon murders another prisoner and faces trial nhis young lawyer slater is fresh out of law school but determined to put alcatraz on trial for the abuses of it warden gary oldman nthe result is the usual courtroom theatrics imagine a stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students ntheres very little to praise here outside of kevin bacons earnest overacting and the appropriate story ntheres a lot of overacting from everyoneyou know youre in trouble right away when r lee ermey the drill sergeant in full metal jacket is cast as a judge the center of reason and moderation nslater has never been convincing and certainly isnt here and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances nbut the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story nthere are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters let alone with them nhow frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions nif theres anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world it is our ability to tell a good story nhave we forgotten n
dont get me wrong i tend to appreciate bessons naive unashamedly romantic worldview an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood nhis 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman and 1997s the fifth element is a goofy paean to love luv thats even more of a hoot on repeated viewings nbut his joan of arc is a mess despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a closecropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself njovovich bessons own personal muse through the making of his last two films though theyve since separated is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior but also a fabulous supermodellevel babe nand besson remains a servicable action film director though not an especially facile one nleading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english joans struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring and besson helps you understand how the french could believe fervently that god is on her side nbessons big mistake i think is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject nyes joan had visions but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blueeyed christ figure on display in bessons hallucinatory dream sequences nthe whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman billed as the conscience shows up spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell babbling like ally mcbeal nthats kind of a shame since she does quite well up to that point charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness nthat darkly attractive aspect of her character that shes as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord is more or less betrayed by the final reels in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing shes overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady whos about to take a fall nas the story winds down with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance ntrouble is hes chosen a lurid often jokey tone for the balance of the picture including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes and its impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is to a great extent nothing more than a puton nthis glib prefab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyers the passion of joan of arc 1928 a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joans trial and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema ncompared to that film the messenger plays as a crime against history n directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich franceusa 1999 ntheatrical aspect ratio 2 35 1 n
i have always been a fan of director neil jordan from his early work such as 1984s the company of wolves to 1992s the crying game and 1994s interview with a vampire nhis latest film the butcher boy is a return to his roots in ireland but unfortunately it is not a successful homecoming ntold through the eyes of a 12yearold irish boy francis newcomer eomann owens this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life nhis father stephen rea is an indifferent alcoholic his mother fiona shaw is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore nfrancis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic even capable of brutal murder nthe premise of the butcher boy is one that could have very well been turned into a thoughtprovoking disturbing motion picture but somehow nothing works nfrancis is in almost every scene but we learn very little about him as if the film was distancing itself away from him when i suspect we were actually supposed to sympathize with him nthis is definately not young owens fault however because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance and is able to also seem menacing as well nthe fact that we dont get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay nthe supporting characters are no help though nrea is wasted and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son or to anyone else for that matter nhe usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout nshaw has a little bit more to work with since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her nand singer sinead oconnor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice nthe pacing is all off in the butcher boy nalthough the story could have been dynamite it moves at a deadeningly slow rate and i found my mind wandering every once in a while nit is also very episodic because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs nat one point francis is sent away to a juvenile prison and an odd possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself but nothing comes of it nid rather think of the butcher boy as a brief diversion for director jordan rather than a total misfire nhe has already proven to be a strong director but he lucked out with this latest film nwhat could have been a courageous unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy only manages to be an ineffective uninvolivng bore n
synopsis a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boys mother a fledgling restauranteur nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the womans favor he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way ncomments stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurnedpsychosgettingtheirrevenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry both theatrical and directtovideo ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that theyre typically inexpensive to produce no special effects no big name stars and serve as vehicles to flash nudity allowing them to frequent latenight cable television nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect the psycho never actually has an affair on the contrary hes rejected rather quickly the psycho typically is an exlover exwife or exhusband nother than that stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable nstalked does not provide much suspense though that is what it sets out to do ninterspersed throughout the opening credits for instance a serioussounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk its implicitly implied that all stalkers are men while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen nafter these credits a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears nthe narrator states that this is the story of daryl gleason and tells the audience that he is the stalker nof course really this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels nif the movie was meant to be about daryl then it should have been called stalker not stalked nokay so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts no guesswork required nstalked proceeds then as it begins obvious obvious obvious nthe opening sequence contrived quite a bit brings daryl and brooke the victim together ndaryl obsesses over brooke follows her around and tries to woo her nultimately rejected by her his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate nthese plans include the alltime psychoinlove cliche the murdered pet nfor some reason this genres films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked nstalked is no exception its a cat this time found in the shower nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked where only one survives guess who it invariably always is and youll guess the conclusion to this turkey nstalkeds cast is uniformly adequate not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either njay underwood as the stalker turns toward melodrama a bit too much nhe overdoes it in other words but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands nmaryam dabo about the only actor close to being a star here she played the bond chick in the living daylights is equally adequate as the stalked of the title even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong independent businessowner nbrooke dabo needs to be ditzy however for the plot to proceed ntoward the end for example brooke has her suspicions about daryl nto ensure he wont use it as another excuse to see her brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers nof course not nshe tries the door opens it and wanders around the house nwhen daryl returns he enters the house of course so our heroine is in danger nsomehow even though her car is parked at the front of the house right by the front door daryl is oblivious to her presence inside nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audiences suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either characters intelligence nstalked receives two stars because even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring it is not so bad that it cannot be watched nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are nif youre in the mood for a good suspense film though stake out something else n
have you ever been in an automobile accident where youve miraculously walked away with only a few scratches yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable mangled wreck nwell that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation nbut after watching this inane exercise of a movie i certainly feel that ive miraculously walked away unscathed after a twohour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond noddly eye of the beholder which is a psychologicalromancethriller starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent called the eye ewan mcgregor working in washington dc nin the humorous opening scene he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down nusing an array of hightech surveillance and communications equipment he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office nthe law firms employees get a good chuckle nthe audience gets a good chuckle nthe eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman ashley judd nthere is something compelling about this mysterious woman ndespite her glamorous looks however we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her nafter the murders she sobs while singing the christmas tune little bluebirds and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago nafter each killing she puts on a different wig assumes a new name and then makes her way to another state nthe eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions nbut he does not alert the authorities nhe somehow empathizes with her sense of loss nthe eye it turns out also is haunted by his past nhis daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life nhis tormented psyche creates a ghostlike image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation nshe becomes a sort of spectral adviser and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman nhe now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation nit doesnt matter that he has witnessed all of her murders nand it doesnt matter that the eye is abnormally reticent hiding his entire life behind computer screens nhe follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble nwhen a crazed druggie jason priestley attacks her he shows up for some quick butt kicking nwhen the police are closing in to arrest her he provides a distraction so that she can escape nall the while the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight npeculiar nhow bad is this movie ni refer you to my review quote source litmus test njust take a look at the fullpage ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes nfor this movie they are from magazines called flaunt and mirabella nno doubt they were impressed with judds series of catwalks and disguise changes nthe major problem with eye of the beholder is that the film jerks forward always unsure of its ultimate destination nif it was a thriller there was little to keep us entranced nif it was a love story there was absolutely no emotional pull ncompletely disjointed in structure its only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial the one where the 6 on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a childs train set ni am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents nbeyond that the film is hopelessly outofcontrol and is in need of seriously better traction and handling n
there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director nof course his best film was 1978s masterpiece halloween but he also made 1980s the fog and 1987s underrated prince of darkness nheck he even made a good film in 1995 with in the mouth of madness nbut something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 with the terrible comedy memoirs of an invisible man nsomehow carpenter has lost his touch with junk like his failed 1995 remake of village of the damned to his uninspired 1996 sequel escape from l a those movies however look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film john carpenters vampires nif i was him i definately wouldnt want to put my own name in the title nit is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as vampires nthe story is simple njack crow james woods is a vampire hunter who along with one of his partners montoya daniel baldwin and a prostitute katrina sheryl lee survives an attack from the master vampire valek thomas ian griffith nsince katrina was previously bitten by him crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her nit seems valeks mission is to steal a black wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him nmy question is how many time have we seen this same story played out nwell the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made n john carpenters vampires sadly enough is one of the most unscary horror films ive ever seen nin fact there isnt even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105minute running time nthe nonstop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed without any interesting camera work which is usually a trademark of carpenters nand then we come to the screenplay which as far as i can tell is nearly nonexistent nthere is no story development and there isnt even an attempt to flesh out the characters njames woods can be a good actor but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of pseudo clever lines of dialogue ndaniel baldwin has some potential but his character comes off as being very dense nand sheryl lee faring much better as laura palmer in twin peaks like all of the female characters plays an offensive stereotypical whore nthere is not an ounce of intelligence or excitement in john carpenters vamires which is very disheartening coming from an exfan of carpenters nhe has said that he turned down directing halloween h20 because he couldnt work up any excitement for it nand yet when asked about a vampires sequel he said he would be happy to do it ni think thats a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent not to mention a significant number of iq points n
it seems that ive stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch ntake payback for example a movie that most people seem to like nhowever its horrible schlock straight out of hollywoods vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies nit was written and directed by a guy who should have done better however maybe he did do better after all 30 percent of the movie isnt his own nmel gibson that hollywood zombie decided he didnt like the ending and had another director reshoot it nwhat a crock nif you sign on to do a movie then do it the way the script calls for nwhy film a movie and then look at it later and say no i changed my mind i dont like the ending nyoure fired nlets get someone else to do it n i suppose honor is dead in hollywood nthe end of the film is of course hollywoodized nwhich is to say that its happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize nin this case as is most victories in hollywood movies gibsons prize is a blond and money ni miss originality in film i really do ni think audiences are so starved for it that theyll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original npaybacks tagline get ready to root for the bad guy promised an original idea but it was far from the truth nwhile gibsons character certainly broke the law he was a character that had honor odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it wouldnt kill in front of children and protects his blond woman ntheres nothing bad about him hes a hollywood character a person who could never exist in real life nand gibson knows it he spends his time trying to act like a bad guy and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant nthe story involves gibson being doublecrossed by his partner who is a real bad guy which made me wish that we could root for him over 70 000 ngibson recovers from multiple gunshots is pissed naturally and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back no more no less nhe makes a point of it that its strictly 70 grand na real bad guy would have made his expartner pay 25 interest nthis idea is completely stretched out ngibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with nwhat i didnt understand this is the chicago mafia n70 000 is like spare change to them ntheyd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him ni think theyd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple 70 000 nmaybe im being too hard on the movie nperhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie ni read roger eberts review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy nthats why were allowed to root for him nand its true gibson walks the movie as if hes smiling at a joke he just heard nbut hes wrong here ni wanted a lee marvin or oldtime clint eastwood or somebody who wasnt a comic just an ass kicker nas a side note ive just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback nafter this many reviews why would anyone want to read this nreally i dont care nim just trying to gain membership into the online film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can n
a followup to disneys liveaction 101 dalmatians thats better more entertaining than the first njust as unlikely nwith 102 dalmatians the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs more is definitely not the merrier n1996s 101 dalmatians certainly wasnt the greatest moviegoing experience of all time but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous largerthanlife performance nin addition we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies nthis time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen and closes facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53yearold actress under that startling black and white wig of hers nbut thats only half the problem with kevin limas laborious film nwhat makes 102 dalmatians such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor here almost singlehandedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks hes a dog voiced by eric idle its rabid plotlessness cruella goes after puppies again winds up in goo again and most of all the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic heroes of the piece a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blanderthanbland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ngruffudd is cute and harmless perhaps but evans cant even aspire to that nthe dogs upstage them both of course but in the case of evans even closes split ends are more animated nbad acting however seems to be a requirement for this sequel since g rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niros in men of honor njean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieus overthetop antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail and wail for wail nfrances most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself and in 102 dalmatians the producers milk that realization for all its worthle pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as poopies par example and ad nauseum nthe finesses of the script attributed to four screenwriters no less and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up are quickly dispensed with since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben nthat done its back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore offlimits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown nthe dogs are pretty cutetry making a puppy look otherwisebut thats pretty much all they are ntheres always the feeling that theres a trainer off in the wings coaxing the dogs to open doors or pick up their food bowls in unison or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder nsavvy holiday goers should skip 102 dalmatians and pop the original 1961 animated classic into their vcrs instead nits one dalmatian less but 101 more satisfying n
m i2 the sequel to mission impossible is a james bond wannabe film but it fails to even come close to that film in wit humor and entertainment value nit tries to be a spyromance movie but without any suspense the film just looks like its an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses nit is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human nthe coolest thing about this movie was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols nthe film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence nexcept for the choreographed action sequences the film was dull for threequarters of its time filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed nas for the action scenes they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films but their advertisement for sadistic responses is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen nm i2 opens and closes with fastpaced action scenes but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue nthe film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus at that point nthe only thing that kept me awake was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the films supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way nits a megabuck film adapted from a popular hightech gadgetry tv series nbut its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it and it failed to produce a story that had any substance njohn woo broken arrow faceoff is good at doing car chases choreographed fights with midair flips and kungfu kicks slomo shots of two guns blazing and of fire explosions but he just cant seem to handle dialogue and suspense nthe star of the film and coproducer tom cruise and his romantic interest thandie newton are miscast ncruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile as he tries to carry off this macho role while thandie is not an actionfilm girl and seems like a fish outofwater in this one ntheir romance didnt work not only was it tepid and not sexy but it wasnt convincing nthe film opens with dizzying speed perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success nwe will be in three different locations instantaneously sydney the american southwest and seville nfirst we are in sydney australia where a scientist with a muffled russian accent dr nekhorvich rade mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it nhe also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain nwhich explains the films mythic theme as nwe enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil nthe one who played the villain dougray scott does so in a onedimensional gruff tone which did not distinguish him in that role nat least if the film got the villain part right it might have had some fun with this nonsense nsoon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains nbefore they crash the plane and parachute out of it the one who was posing as dimitri turns out to be sean ambrose scott a rogue member of the imf which is a cialike clone nhe steals the package with the antidote peels off a latex mask which is a replica of the hero of the story ethan hunt cruise who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust nsean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices nwe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in faceoff and in the original mission impossible which as convoluted a plot as that film had it was still a superior film to this sequel nwoo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground as it is used so often in this film by both sides so much so that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain nit makes it seem as if anyone could be another character which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense nnext we are in a mountain range in the american southwest and ethan is on vacation hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard delivers via a rocket launcher a pair of talking sunglasses nhunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help billy baird john polson and luther stickell ving rhames with luther running a highgadget computer but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall thandie to join his team nhe is told as an incentive to recruit her all her criminal charges will be dropped nhopkins then signs off with the tag line this message will selfdestruct in five seconds nactually with the departure of hopkins it was this disposable film that actually selfdestructed at this point nin seville hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road nhe also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal and learns that she is valuable because her exboyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f ck her nthe imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f ck him as she leads them to his hideout in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort the south african hugh stamp richard roxburgh nrobert towne the screenwriter who contributed to the first mission who is noted for doing chinatown writes a colorless pedestrian script one that fails even to be funny in a camp way nthe terrorists who aim to rule the world are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote insuring that they will make billions on the stock nethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah with his only conflict being who is more important to save first nethan does this rescue against all odds as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company fight it out with sean and the other terrorists and rescue nyah who injected herself with the virus to hinder seans getting it as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle nethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle using kickboxing winning a shootout throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists making some more use out of that peeling mask bit and by being completely fearless and larger than life while he kicks everyones ass nif i was only entertained by this i ncould have lived with it nbut this film was so badly made that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game seeing only the slamdunks but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast nin any case this is a criticproof film and will in all probability do well in the box office as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into n

whats to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornographyie nthe garbage known as snuff films nnothing right nwhats to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography nwell nothing nso why make it hollywood ntheres no reason why the average sane moviegoer will be interested in such a topic nno one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this nthe lack of quality filmmaking in 8mm from technical to acting stands out even more when you consider the star writer and supporting castall reputable nbut joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again nlike paul schrader schumacher has his moments but theyre few and far far nbetween nbasically this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it nwhy not walk out nwell this wouldnt be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie nheres why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of 8mm nfirst thingif you dont heed my advice then understand what youre about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud nits not easy to watch ni didnt know the details of the story beforehand but at least my ignorance can help others now nthe ha plot revolves around tom welles nicolas cage as a surveillance expert and private investigator na rich old woman discovers a snuff film in her late husbands safe nshe calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl it had to be a young girl didnt it schumacher who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead nshes horrified that her husband would have owned such a film in 8mm of course and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find nfamilyman welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque murder nlet me backtrack for a moment nsee snuff films are pornos with a violent twistpeople are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead nhowever the deaths are often staged and in those cases special effects and good acting make all the difference nvery sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hardtofind movies nthe thought of this industry makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review but ill swallow my bile and move on nwelles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry nyoud think hes sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him nhe comes across smut clerk max joaquin phoenix who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze nafter a lot of digging and bribing welles finds the men who are responsible for making this and other snuff films nskip ahead skip ahead skip ahead nled by dino velvet peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance and startorturer machine christopher bauer they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue nthe movie doesnt end there unfortunately because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films dobecome a vigilante nthis film doesnt draw you in nit keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close nit is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ie n se7en but it takes a large measure of restraint schumacher has none and a larger amount of talent schumacher has little nby those jabs im not only referring to his stylish destruction of the batman franchise but a time to kill was an immensely overrated disappointment nfor a guy who gets so much studio money his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled na good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter nwriter andrew kevin walker didnt recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for 95s twisted thriller se7en ndirector schumacher doesnt have that innate ability to make you watch things you dont really want to see like better directors are capable of doing nhe must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we dont see is more frightening than what we do especially when its a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered nhowever gratuitous is joels middle name nhe must think that not flaunting a hardcore act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint nno he doesnt go that far but we see enough unpleasantness nhe doesnt leave much to the imagination nits manipulating to hurt or kill young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante nthe script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ha ha ncraft ncase in point a shot of a christian fellowship bus good right ndrives away to reveal one of the villains bad right nsee no nsubtlety ndoes joel think were stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery nwho do we root for in this mess nis there anybody out there nits not all the directors fault though nwhy did the actors sign up for this nnicolas cage is an oscarwinner for cryin out loud nif he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda nwhat is cage supposed to be in this moviea whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears nvillainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy nand what is james gandolfini doing in this trash nhe was so solid as a concerned father in a civil action ni guess ol nic pete and jim were promised a mountain of money or ntheyre suckers nor they just dont care nthere are moments albeit brief ones where this rises above the wasteland ncatherine keener is good although too quick to threaten divorce as mrs wells nbaby cindy is obviously cute and wells devout love of his daughter is sweet nthe mother amy norton of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter nthis film has an appropriate bluetoned washedout look like payback which was a much better movie nthe editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue but at other times its rough nduring some conversations closeups and wide shots are not cut very well making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts arent good and whose timing was a halfsecond off nsuch a technical error indeed stands out nspeaking of standing out dont believe the misleading trailers ntheres not much action here noccasionally yes but not as often as your tv will have you believe nafter seeing 8mm i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again nis that a positive nwell if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive theyve done a swell job here nitll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chanceunless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved nbut today im not depraved so i ask why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it nim sure that somewhere right now theres some pretty sick crap going on but that doesnt mean i need to know about it nyes mr walker your script tells us that there are some screwedup folks out there nyes mr walker the proverbial monster doesnt look like we expect him to nyou said all that in 1995 nmove on nthis film serves no purpose nit doesnt entertain it doesnt teach us anything it doesnt make a statement beyond the obvious this stuff is bad approach nonly if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile nthats not likely to happen though so 8mm is indeed a scummy waste of money norson welles said years ago in a tribute to film to movies to ngood movies nif only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole nlike snuff films 8mm should never have been made nnow excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it nuseless triviajoel schumacher loves the vigilante theme nhe used it in batman forever in batman robin in a time to kill in falling down and its rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow n
capsule this superlight situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems nthe script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television nthe characters are paperthin and the interesting ideas purely nonexistent nthis is a decrementlifeby90minutes card n 0 4 to 4 njalla jalla nis basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen nit tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love nthe film is set in sweden where roro and mans fares fares and torkel petersson are custodians at a public park roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely mans is a swede from a much more liberal background nthey spend most of the day in the bushes at their park cleaning up after dogs nroro and mans each have girlfriends but each has a problem nroro nicknamed jalla is having family problems nit seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman yasmin laleh pourkarim but he is already in love with lisa tuva novotny nyasmin likes roro but does not want to get married either nmans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence nthe two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other nmans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers nthe one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them nroro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other but then plan to break up before the wedding nnot too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected nthe plot turns in several places are contrived none knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen nlebaneseborn josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer nwhen things start to get slow he just adds throws in another story nfor example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film ncharacterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function nwe do see some of roros family life and his concerns nthat may be because roros background is a lot like that of the director nwhile the story was entertaining i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film nit was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life none does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this ni rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale n
talk about beating a dead horse nwhen home alone was released in 1990 it was a breath of fresh air and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinelyfunny family film nthe unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel so two years later we were subjected to home alone 2 which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited nfor john hughes two home alone movies werent enough he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with including a pathetic box office bomb called babys day out last years liveaction 101 dalmatians and this years flubber nnow inexplicably hughes has exhumed not only these wornout plot elements but the home alone name as well nthe result 1997s worst sequel edging out speed 2 and batman and robin home alone 3 nby changing the characters hughes who wrote and coproduced the film along with his coconspirator director raja gosnell has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest nthe new kid alex pruitt is played by alex d linz one fine day and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness nhes not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was nthe villains pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber nin home alone 3 there are four of them olek krupa david thornton lenny von dohlen and rya kihlstedt but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls nthis time the kid isnt left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip ninstead he has developed a bad case of chicken pox so he cant go to school nhis dad kevin kilner is away on business and his mom haviland morris has to run errands so for the most part hes all by himself during the day nthrough a series of coincidences too irritating to relate a top secret u s air force integrated circuit comes into his possession nits wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alexs home to retrieve it nthe eight year old who is wise beyond his years booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldbergtype devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains nthe movies climax takes place during a raging snowstorm only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable npreviously the most counterfeitlooking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii nthese are far worse nin fact the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this nearblizzard when a shining sun can be seen nif its a wonderful life could generate real looking snow back in the 1940s why cant home alone 3 which has a significantly larger budget and 90s technology at its disposal nthere has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of liveaction cartoon violence for young children nhome alone 3 will add fuel to the fire nits one thing to see wyle e coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen nadults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous but what about five and sixyear olds nthe level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme many of alexs schemes are nasty enough to kill nbut because this is a family film no one dies despite being electrocuted falling thirty feet and getting smacked on the head by a barbell nnot only is home alone 3 unnecessary but its offensive nits an exercise in tediousness and there isnt a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end unless by some strange quirk of fate you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes and thus havent seen this stuff before ni cant imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure nmaybe thats why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumbsucking years n
in the james bond film diamonds are forever tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads nbonds response is that it doesnt really matter as long as collars and cuffs match nwell collars and cuffs dont match in the real blonde nwhat might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny meandering comedy on screen nthe film supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business is wafer thin nit plays like an ally mcbeal episode dragged out to the nth degree replete with a few unnecessary fantasy sequences nwriterdirector tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea nit isnt nthe only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary nmatthew modine plays joe a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent nhes 35 with no agent and no credits since hes too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas n thats not really acting he tells his girlfriend of six years mary catherine keener with whom he bickers constantly about sex nbut they need the money so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video nbut its not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike played by elizabeth berkley still trying to jumpstart her career after showgirls nthis points out how artificial this whole business is one supposes ndicillo has referred to the real blonde as offkilter but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff nthe film which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere is remarkably on kilter and with perhaps the single exception of the alwayslikable modine whos not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks the entire cast is vague and uninteresting ncatherine keener whos appeared in dicillos previous three films including the brilliant living in oblivion is at her most annoying in the real blonde nlook at her closely she really cant act at all nher reactions are all wrong almost always out of sync with her costars nshe reacts too soon or too late to lines and situations nshe moves her eyes or her mouth far too much nshe frowns she yells she babblesshe blows chunks nmaxwell caulfield plays joes actorwaiter buddy bob the one obsessed with dating a natural blonde nbobs personality not to mention caulfields acting ability parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera passion crest stiff and uninteresting nmaybe thats the point ndaryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title a soap dish who beds bob both on and offcamera nhannah looks about fifty in this movie shes only 37 nwhy is that nalmost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples nwhy is that nmarlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer nkathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent nbuck henry plays an uninteresting shrink nchristopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer nand so on nthe best parts of the the real blonde are the beginning and the end brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog ntheres more depth and sincerity in a single closeup of her expressive face than in the entire film nwhile this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters lives the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if its funny n
it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable nthe academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed nit also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers james horner nwhat i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 nwhat drags braveheart down is its screenplay nit abounds with high production values john tolls awardwinning cinematography which also graced edward zwicks 1994 legends of the fall a gorgeous score by horner and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names nbut this does not save a misguided script nthe film wishes to paint its central character as a hero but the viewers only response to his heroism is intellectual william wallace producerdirector mel gibson is fighting for freedom and against tyranny so we have to root for him nbut wallaces actions paint a different story nhe speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance nthough one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king nwallace speaks of freedom but his acts point toward vengeance nafter kicking the english out of scotland he decides to invade england nthis is evident of a spartacus complex and this example applies both historically and cinematically nthe historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities the film spartacus like braveheart has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay nit is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film nhorners score tries to make emotional connection but the performances and the script do not help ngibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him nthis drags down any emotional connection to the films plot and turns three hours into a total waste of time n
the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffanys in which the audience is rooting for some sweet vulnerable irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness nthe problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo played by sookyin lee as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible nalessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene nthis is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland none of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa nshe also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window nnext door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild adam beach nhe sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating nben gets emotionally involved with alessa n as alessa so delicately puts it we were bosom buddies now were fuck buddies nbut alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor nthe real problem with the film seems to be helen lees inability to decide what she wants to be saying nshe undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa nalessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients nthis appears to be a high profile and wellpaid job nwe are supposed to care about alessas feelings but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father nalessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint nthis is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up doublezero ni rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale n
a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent but one with no edge to it nit turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich s and stock characters of this genre nthough its a wellwritten and wellacted fluff piece it still does not have too much to say that is surprising nits made for the gentle arthouse set those who dont want something too disturbing to think about nits about a critically successful writer husband alec pryce who is so selfabsorbed that hes threatened by his department store floorwalking model wife kate bouquet who wants to be a writer nshe meets his crass publisher vanni corso walken another selfabsorbed man and a predictable relationship occurs nthe fireworks occur because she outgrows her husbands first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet nshe now wants her own identity and her independence nthe film looked like the usual sitcom stuff and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie nthe film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax nits set in london and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper vanni nshe later meets him as her hubbys new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel nalec who is an obnoxious grouse someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book publishedwhich only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni nthe publisher is proud that hes a mammas boy who never married and is a selfmade man who has earned millions nhe has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it as he proudly tells kate if my father could sell pizzas in harlem i could sell culture in europe nthe only thing that couldnt be sold is this stiff story and tired plot line nthe mystery to me is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy nshe soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soontobecomebeleaguered vanni nwhen she writes a second novel he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did nit ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper na business affair was loosely based on the reallife literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly in their celebrated 1950s love triangle n
in our time nin our modern world where the cool rule its hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming the man nand yet film after film after film is based on his everlasting magic nin warner brothers latest production shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away nthough the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeares romeo and juliet its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york is very hard to associate with shakespeares poetry nthe film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city the afro americans against the chinese nthe youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered nthe afroamericans are immediately suspected but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers nit is at this point that han the romeo of the story finds out about his brothers death nescaping from a prison in china he returns to united states to avenge his brothers fate nbut before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks he falls in love with a mysterious beauty nthe only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy ntheres only a weak echo of shakespeares talent in this disappointing production nand there are more problems besides its title nof course we dont call it a deformation of a great masterpiece nwe call it modernization nit seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics without any car chases and gun fights nthis lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing nkenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesnt need to be updated because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature nand as long as love hate honesty and corruption do exist everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare ni must admit that i found rome must die very confusing ni can forgive andrzej bartkowiak since it is his first attempt at directing nhe manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision nunfortunately he completely forgot about character and story developments nhis latest picture is therefore visually impressive but intellectually hollow nthe love story between han jet li and trish aalyah and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified njet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice ntheir achievement save this film from being completely braindead but they are not actors and therefore can not act nthey are nothing more than two celebrities put together nthe other actors including isaiah washington russell wong henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances ndelroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality nbut theres more than acting to worry about neven with lis incredible skills in martial arts the action scenes though technically excellent are too long and story updates simply embarrassing nto make a long story short romeo must die is not intelligent enough to be a thriller not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film nit is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to romeo and juliet so the film is completely stuck not sure of what to be nand in the end its nothing nthere are no performances worthy of notice no interesting character or story surprises nso again the only good thing about it is its technical achievement nthis film can boast of great sound fast paced editing solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences nthe music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre nit is mostly provided by aalyahs enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists that create a kind of ghetto feel to it nbut when i think back its not much i remember from this production nas in almost every summer movie there are some interesting scenes but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects nit is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities simply because it doesnt have any nfor someone who has never read shakespeare its another popcorn film nfor those of us who has its a waste of money time and brain cells n
seen may 2 1998 at 3 40 p m at the crossgates cinema 18 theater 13 with chris wessell and sean oshea for 5 ntheater rating 12 very good sound picture and seats nthe bigbudget megahype event movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one ngluttony is hollywoods favorite sin but it is the moviegoers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an everworsening basis n lost in space is the latest such offering a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre nits made up of every element of science fiction but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for naudiences attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films this one opens with a fastpaced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film probably because it has star wars written all over it but as the producers way of showing off their budget through the special effects nbattle scenes are worthless without tension and since we have no idea what the setting is its impossible to care about anything that happens nin essence the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game not a piece of filmmaking nwe meet the robinson family a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earths behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources neach member of the family has a special trait and personality and yet none of them seem like actual people nprofessor john robinson hurt is the intelligent quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it its obvious what role this aspect will play nof course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other while the necessary problems are resolved at the right moments nthe only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact its presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire and is so pathetic its laughable nthe first act is not a building of a story but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements such as plot conflict and characterization god forbid nwere provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent nin fact it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually nonexistent nyes the characters do speak but they do not talk nthey say things that only relate to the conflict but they never really interact unless its the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west leblanc and uptight unemotional judy robinson graham nits amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens neventually the pacing rapidly increases but the amount of genuine interest does not nthe story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr smith oldman the cartoony villain and his plans for sabotage nwhat ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts nthe first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as alien lite nthe story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive nbut theres never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly nplotlines are developed but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario nthe atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes but its presented in such a ridiculous way its utterly boring nby the time the last act rolls around there is no sense of a payoff building nthe ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax instead it seems to come to a sudden halt but at least it ends at all n lost in space is major film production at its worst nits frightening that a film so poorly written directed and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment n
summer movies are by nature dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money nwild wild west the latest will smith affair follows much the same formula except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies nwill smith plays jim west a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses nhe is called by president grant kline to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing nwest is paired up with scientist artemus gordon kline again and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind named dr loveless branagh with a zany moustache nbefore i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair ill give it a chance with the positives ntheres a nice credit sequence the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye and the special effects are decent enough ntheres also a pleasant soundtrack nburied deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes nand salma hayek pops up as the female interest which is always nice to see napart from these factors though nothing else in wild wild west works nfirstly theres little chemistry between smith and kline who appears to be in it purely for the money none would expect zingers passing between the two none arise nboth of them plod through the below standard plot knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end nnot even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment although he is over the top the material doesnt present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy ntherefore he just comes across as loud as obnoxious nthe only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek who is given so little screen time its embarrassing nshe appears to be in the film to merely show off her body and be ogled at by kline and smith nher character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script and there is no sense of realism about the character nthe humour in the film is also very off nwill smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black here not even smith could save the humour on display nthe script largely boils down to insults that arent very funny and oneliners that barely raise a smirk nits also somewhat racist although it doesnt intend to be with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching and actually says slavery is good to save himself nits not a funny scene and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably nthe film also makes the tragic mistake that a man in this case kline in a dress is automatically unfunny it isnt but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness ntheres also problems with the plot njim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying and rely purely on luck rather than audience pleasing skill nplot elements are introduced into the film and then thrown away just as quickly nthe main piece of the story a 80 foot mechanical steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive but theres no particular reason why it should be built nwhy not loveless build a great big tank instead of an ungainly fragile piece of machinery thats just begging to be blown up ndirector barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them with some nice camera tricks but even this is missing from this stilted affair nwild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing but not much of it is evident making this film drag out even more nits a sad thing when four credited screenwriters a talented director and a willing star cant make a film work and eventually wild wild west collapses under its sexist mildly racist unfunny weight n
note to screenwriters and self when you hit the big time and the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your bottom drawer tell em all to hit the road ngilligan wrote the arbitrarilytitled home fries ten years ago it was shelved until he found success as one of the took a second look at gilligans comedy they read it again wearing rosetinted glasses ndrew stars as sally a dim but sweet pregnant waitress at a small town burger joint located somewhere in the southern united states nthe father of her child is dead the victim of a severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons these flyboys scared him with their lowflying helicopter ndorian wilson and angus busey were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother ohara ntrouble is sally picked up some interference on her drivethru headset and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior to the accidental killing nso dorian goes undercover as a burgerflipper before you can say with cheese he falls for the mothertobe ntoo bad mom and angus have homicidal plans for sally ndoes this sound like a movie you want to see nwithout a doubt the best thing about home fries is barrymore at the risk of sounding sexist shes never looked better than here as a curly redhead with twinkling eyes nshe is winning in a role that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look applecheek cute and gawk at wilson her reallife boyfriend nbut the plot and the situations are so offputting that nothing could save it nthis movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers but home fries brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel nits raising arizona without babies without charm without laughs without human characters and without intelligence worst of all its creepy nwhats funny about threatening to gun down a pregnant woman with a machine gun n unless the woman in question is a spice girl ntake out the helicopters the quasiincestuous relationship between the mother and her sons it is absolutely illogical within the movies framework that dorian still lives with his mother and brother and the scenes of murder attempted and otherwise and what are you left with nthe story of a single woman with child who works at a fast food joint but dreams of becoming a country singer nthat could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made but itd be better than home fries n
old soldiers never die they just turn into cliches nsoldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman nthe warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body njungian archetypes these two opposites need each other to create a whole but its difficult to integrate both noften well encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and with the help of jungs magician sit around imagining grand schemes nwithout the drive to manifest their plans much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness all they have are dreams nwarriors on the other hand are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat and will do combat with every last bit of their energy nthey dont care enough about anything to know whats worth fighting for gladiators who live only for the battle nthis dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know but can also illustrate societies namerica during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers ntodd 3465 kurt russell is a living breathing archetype nchosen from birth as a soldier he is raised by the government to be a killing machine nhis childhood is cruelty and competition nhe is indoctrinated with the big rules nnever question authority nwinning is everything nstrength beats knowledge na veteran of numerous intergalactic wars todd is 40 and hes obsolete na new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger nleft for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers caine 607 jason scott lee hes unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 a garbage world nobviously our hero is still alive nhe finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health nwhen the peaceloving colonists get a good look at who todd is they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world nthey are the other good guys nthese lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons ntodd finds himself in the role of protector nwhat could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultraright wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon nthe effects are mostly secondrate explosions or jerky slow motion nthe plot is old hat nwe dont get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers nhardly anything makes sense nthe films science fares badly nwith all the remarkable advances weve made in just 37 years the film takes place in 2036 were still stupid nafter conquering the stars for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away neven stranger the garbage barges appear to double as time machines nvirtually all the trash is vintage 1960 nthere is nothing in the story that is not predictable nthe first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra connie nielsen the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him nit doesnt take a genius to foresee that her husband isnt going to be around much longer nis it a shock to find out that the films climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine nwho would you guess wins nsome of the scenes would work if this were a comedy ntodds first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connies nipple poking through her thin blouse nlater as he sits by his lonely campfire a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion nsupposedly this clich isnt meant to be humorous ndastardly col mekum jason isaacs with a pencilthin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash nresponsible for last years quirky and visually enticing but problematic the fifth element director paul anderson sees the film as shane in outer space nmaybe if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode nthe movie doesnt even work as an action film nthere is never a question as to the outcome nsomehow the new superior soldiers dont prove much of a match for todd nthe acting isnt anything to write home about nnielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim nrussell is buffedup and does a credible job but its not much of a challenge nuttering around 100 words during the film mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space ngary busey as todds commanding officer is completely wasted in his lowkey role neverything blows up and occasionally it looks cool nsometimes the sets are impressive nunfortunately occasionally and sometimes dont make a film nmost disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote blade runner possibly the best science fiction movie ever made nsharpeyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film npeoples says that this is not a blade runner sequel but a sidequel that takes place in the same universe nalthough that may have been the intent in his original script the result is more like a bad television series that the blade runner

under any other circumstances i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review nhowever in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful a minute dissection of the ending is necessary neven though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes do proceed at your own risk nthe movie opens quite poorly i might add as child psychologist malcolm crowe bruce willis looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolms past patients ndistraught the suicidal man a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself ncut to the next fall as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case a trouble young man named cole haley joel osment one of the only child actors in a while i didnt want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument nafter about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences we learn that cole has the sixth sense the gift of being able to communicate with the dead nand this as they say is where the healing begins nthe sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film one of roger eberts colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of siskel and ebert nalthough i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ive always been a sucker for surprise endings my favorite movie is the usual suspects and rarely dislike a film that sports one nhere since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the films conclusion the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending something ive fallen victim to in the past was eliminated nand indeed my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment nstripped of the element of surprise the film was put to the task of showing what it really had instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion nafter seeing its true colors i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is despite what the many champions of the movie may say void of any real power nits a neat concept but not one that justifies being made into a featurelength movie nin fact the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earthshattering revelation that is yet to come nand when the final moments do come its a huge letdown the end makes no sense at all nit stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level ni wont go into any details but suffice to say that as far as i can tell it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder nnow in all fairness i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending however stupid it may be had it not been revealed to me before hand nhowever i feel very confident that i as well as anyone who had seen a few twilight zone episodes would have seen it coming a mile away nthe fact that moviegoers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped nironically to fully appreciate the best scene that of cole and malcolm attending a little girls funeral the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy ni wouldnt have even known about this mental disease if i hadnt by pure dumb luck caught dateline nbc the other week when they did a feature story on it ndespite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace in the end the sixth sense is too chalkfull of contradictions and just isnt plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation n
perhaps if the impostors didnt have so much going for it it wouldnt have been such a tremendous disappointment nwritten directed and produced by one of its two stars stanley tucci whose last picture was the indie smash hit big night the impostors almost never catches fire nsputtering like a twoday old campfire the story plays like an adlib sketch that was never polished or completed nthe films other star oliver platt was hilarious as the senators aide in bulworth nthe bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent including woody allen steve buscemi hope davis alfred molina campbell scott lili taylor and tony shalhoub nall are wasted save allen who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes n the audience will easily identify with allens sentiments nwith the exception of a single original joke involving mirrorimaged subtitles the movie engenders little genuine laughter nthe stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it nthe plot for the movie involves two starving actors maurice oliver platt and arthur stanley tucci who accidentally end up on a cruise ship nin order to escape an angry shakespearean actor alfred molina who is chasing them they dress up as ships stewards nthe overthetop script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer nwhen the leads hide from their pursuers arthur covers maurices mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze nat other times we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else while darting in and out of staterooms nwith the films chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce nthe press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having ntoo bad they werent more concerned with the audiences potential enjoyment nthe jokes frequently framed in silence fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground none wonders if anyone ever viewed the films dailies nsurely if they had they would have realized what leaden results they were producing nit is tricky having good actors play bad ones but if they couldnt pull it off they should have just given up n the show is over for this fella steve buscemis character says towards the end nthe mystery is why they didnt all give up in the beginning nthere must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast nthe impostors runs 1 42 nit is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up n
movies based on video games such as street fighter or mario bros have never generated much interest at the box office nbut when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 it did surprisingly well nwith a simple story a pulsating soundtrack and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy nit got my vote for the movie where i expected the least and got the most nand if you havent had the opportunity i would definitely recommend that you see it on video nin the world of mortal kombat based on the popular arcade game dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earths realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity nthe mortal kombat refers to a competition fought by human mortals against outworlds minions which if won will guarantee earths safety for another generation nmk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition ndespite their victory however a gateway has somehow opened and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth noutworlds warriors include an impressive collection of fighters including shao kahn mintoro a centaur sheeva a fourarmed ogre and sindel nearths mortal warriors under the leadership of the benevolent god lord rayden includes liu kang princess kitana sonya blade and jax who must fight against outworlds forces nits an easy enough premise but unfortunately very unfortunately the writers try to do too much with the movie nit is only a video game after all but the onscreen version tries to go beyond its comic book boundaries by adding depth a conceptualization of selfworth and worst of all a love story nthis becomes very awkward because all of the players are fighters and nothing more nthey are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act nthis becomes embarrassingly apparent for example as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana nthe original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best nthey spoke little but fought a lot nthus the movie was easy to digest nhowever mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth an element that was lacking in the first movie but the attempt here fails miserably nthis uneasy feeling is readily apparent for example whenever you hear lord rayden speak nnot only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic e g nuseless advice but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ntry reading this half as fast and youll hear what i mean nbut the movie is not a complete fatality nfight scenes are wellchoreographed highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility nand players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo neven if youre not familiar with the video game each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves nbut its just too little of what moviegoers and especially fans of the game will expect noddly the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence nand the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival n i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom nrent the first one but the sequel is for kombat fans only n
